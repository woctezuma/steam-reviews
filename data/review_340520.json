"playtime_forever": 323, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3, "last_played": 1514013138}, "language": "english", "review": "I absolutely love this game. Tallowmeres' combat is very punishing for mistakes, like if you aren't paying attention to what enemies are in the room, or you attack at the wrong moments. But that makes the game even more fun for me. If you dislike difficult games then don't get this, but if you like a good challenging game, I definately can't recommend this enough. The price of $3.99 is more than worth it. \n\n     Almost every weapon in Tallowmere has a different, unique ability. If you watched the video for it already then you've probly seen them. For example, my favorite weapon, the Emerald Dagger, allows you to turn invisible after a few seconds. Allowing you to sneak up behind enemies and backstab them for massive damage. The Katana, probably the most risky weapon to use, allows you to automatically teleport to nearby enemies and damage them. While risky to use, it is one hell of a joyride. But unfortunately, Tallowmere doesn't have many items, so the game can get repetetive in terms of items.\n\n     Finally, we're going to be talking about the enemies of Tallowmere. Tallowmere doesn't have too many enemies So I should be able to get through all of them, this is more of a guide, so you can skip to the end if you want. FIrst of all is the leaper or jumper or whatever they're called lol. So the leapers are grey with weird masks. They have a very short line of sight but are very dangerous if not approached right. I'd recommend using an emerald dagger and sneak up behind them and backstab them for an instant kill. If you don't have an emerald dagger, approach the leaper with your shield up, and let them attack your shield, then attack them once and repeat.\n\n     The next enemy we're talking about is the zaeries. Zairies are small flying things that can get annoying. They are pretty easy to take care of so just block one or two attacks, then try to attack them 3 times to kill them. \n\n     The next enemy we're talking about is the ogre. These guys are either the most annoying or second most annoying enemy in basically everyones opinion. These guys throw purple potions that will track you down no matter where you what. If one of these potions hits you, you will be stunned for a short time. This can be very troublesome if you're in a cluster of enemies or there are multiple ogres in a crammed area. The strategy I use for killing these guys is that I will slowly walk up to them with my shield raised and when I get right up in their faces, I'll wait for them to raise their arm up to throw a potion, I'll jump up with my shield still in hand because if you don't jump, the potion will go over your head and behind you. After I block the potion, I'll just spam them to death.\n\n     The next enemy are the feelers. After a second or two of noticing you, they will shoot a little harpoon like object that will pull you towards them, this can be blocked with your shield, but if you don't block it this can be very deadly, especially if there's an ogre or a group of enemies next to them. The easiest way of taking these guys out is using the rocket launcher due to it locking onto nearby enemies. But if you don't have a rocket launcher, here's my method. So I'll charge them, with my shield up, and when I reach them, I'll make them do their attack, block it, and then hit it 2 times and repeat. \n\n     Next up are the lightning mages. These guys are pretty easy to kill so let's just get this out of the way. You can make them kill themselves by bating their attack, running up to them point blank, putting your shield down and waiting for the white aura around them to appear, then raising your shield. This will damage them. To kill them with weapons, follow the same method as earlier but attack them in between attacks. \n\n     Next up are the fire mages. These guys are easy to kill just like the lightning guys. Use the same method as you would for the lightning guys to take them out, but they can't take any damage from their own fireballs. \n    \n     Next up are the flail knight. These guys can get pretty annoying. So alert them, wait for the ball to spin around 2 times and then rush them, they should die before the ball can get back to them. \n\n     Next up are the archers. These guys are different than most enemies. So just hold your shield up and run at them, then hit them as much as you can while blocking as many arrows as you can. \n\n     And finally we have the bloats I'm pretty sure they're called. These guys are pretty easy to take care of lure them towards you, then when they start doing their suicide animation, run away. If you do manage to get caught in the explosion radius, you will be stunned, this can be blocked by your shield though. You can use these guys as a weapon, as they can stun other enemies for you, including the feelers, which makes them fall to the ground, making them much easier to kill. \n\n    Well that just about does it, all around I love this game, I only have 4 hours and I'm already hooked on the addicting gameplay, you should definately give it a try, I hope I helped you decide on if you should buy it or not.

Othertimes, you play for two minutes before getting stun-locked and dying.\n\nMostly, you get stun-locked and die.\n\nHave I mentioned you get stun-locked and die?

I find it to be what many call 'cozy' similar to the old Win3.1 game Castle of the Winds. Although this game isn't nearly as complex as that game, despite being much more advanced graphically.\n\nI saw everything it has to offer hours ago and am just trying to go as deep into Lady Tallowmere's dungeons as possible, but I find myself coming back to it when I'm between other games or just momentarily bored with my current PC game. Success is kind of contingent upon the gear you can find, but that's usually the case with games in this bloated genre. \n\nUnlike many other games in its genre, weapons all have different handling dynamics and some impart special powers, like the valuable daggers which allow you to move unseen unless you attack or are touched/damaged and are vital in setting up your approach to taking out groups of monsters. Most of the time I've died I've unintentionally killed myself, and once you know how to handle all the things your game can throw your way, it's really only about optimizing your equipment and keeping strategies in mind. The mechanics are extremely simple but it's easy to understand how they work and if something happens, it's because you messed up. You will blow yourself up with grenades. Be forewarned.\n\nThe one mark against it is that the procedural generation occasionally screws you royally, particularly with placement of buzzsaws, but this is the nature of procedural generation.\n\nYou may want to wait for a sale, but $3.99 isn't all that much for what you get, especially since the game has a sense of humor about itself which I enjoy.", "timestamp_created":

The cute pixelated graphics, combined with gory deaths and silly dialogue gives this game a certain charm.  Highly recommended, as it's easy to pick up and jump right into, and no two gameplay runs will be the same, so there's plenty of room for replayablility.", "timestamp_created": 1498950917, "timestamp_updated": 1498950917, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 26, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.758450", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33078348": {"recommendationid": "33078348", "author": {"steamid": "76561198240383680", "num_games_owned": 149, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 182, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497895537}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "PARA DE VER AN\u00c1LISES NEGATIVAS MANOOOOOOOOOOO !!!!\nO JOGO \u00c9 B\u00c3O PODE COMPRAR !!!!!!!!!!\n\n\n\n\nE aproveita e se inscreve no meu canal :D\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCC2w8EaJWN6bQQd1v9yw5GA", "timestamp_created": 1498906188, "timestamp_updated": 1498906188, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.434783", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32973839": {"recommendationid": "32973839", "author": {"steamid": "76561198148812672", "num_games_owned": 25, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 125, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511150562}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b57 \u8d5e", "timestamp_created": 1498713272, "timestamp_updated": 1498713272, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32928222": {"recommendationid": "32928222", "author": {"steamid": "76561198213005517", "num_games_owned": 870, "num_reviews": 52, "playtime_forever": 453, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511510798}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u633a\u597d\u73a9\u7684\n\u8df3\u8dc3\u592a\u9b54\u6027\u4e86\nNPC\u5982\u7eb8\u7247\u642c\u7684\u8f6c\u8eab\u8ba9\u4eba\u5370\u8c61\u6df1\u523b", "timestamp_created": 1498648559, "timestamp_updated": 1498648559, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.610534", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32924342": {"recommendationid": "32924342", "author": {"steamid": "76561198372695651", "num_games_owned": 17, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1118, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 38, "last_played": 1513178012}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u76f8\u5f53\u4e0d\u9519\u7684\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u53ef\u73a9\u6027\u5f88\u9ad8\uff0c\u6d88\u78e8\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u5229\u5668\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u5f88\u4fbf\u5b9c\u3002\u4f46\u9057\u61be\u7684\u4e00\u70b9\u662f\u4e0d\u80fd\u8054\u7f51\u548c\u597d\u53cb\u73a9\uff0c\u53ea\u80fd\u624b\u67c4\u548c\u952e\u76d8\u5408\u4f5c\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u9ebb\u70e6\u3002\u603b\u4f53\u6765\u8bf4\u76f8\u5f53\u4e0d\u9519\uff0c\u590f\u65e5\u6d3b\u52a8\u6b63\u597d\u5165\u624b\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1498643779, "timestamp_updated": 1498643779, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504567", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32879663": {"recommendationid": "32879663", "author": {"steamid": "76561198307672507", "num_games_owned": 120, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 278, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501889360}, "language": "english", "review": "You can get a lot of fun with this game.

pego essa arma o jogo passa a ser apenas apertar um botao (quase que literalmente)\nTerceiro e ultimo ponto e que ha fases geradas com inconsistencia forticidas de armadinhas, criando caminho

I think I'm in love with this game\u2014even though I stink at it. And I love it primarily because of the gameplay.\n\nThis game is a platformer. Modern platformers sometimes frustrate me to the point of tears. For some reason I don't mind here, despite the challenge.\n\nThis game is a roguelike. Sometimes, your starting gear and level just royally screw you over. But unlike many roguelikes, sometimes the game's RNG's are profoundly generous and you can sail right through. But instead of feeling cheap like it can, this makes the game more fun.\n\nThis game is a stat based RPG. But you don't get to pick your path. The game randomly boosts a bunch of your stats like base damage, resist, health find chance. This plays into the roguelike character. Leveling up always feels awesome. Sometimes even more so.\n\nThis game has loot. Pretty amazing loot can come very early. But sometimes it never seems to come at all. Again, the roguelike nature.\n\nThis game plays very quickly. You can easily get crushed in the first 3 rooms. Mediocre luck guarantees you won't make it to room 10 in a game. And you will be dead and done within 5-10 minutes. But once you get a footing, one out of every 5 or 6 games, the game suddenly turns and becomes a blast.\n\nThe graphics and audio are cheap, minimal, kind of quirky. At first I thought I wouldn't like this oddball indie title. But whatever one might think of the various levels and repetitive graphics (it oddly reminds me of Ms. Pacman meets Lode Runner but with contemporary graphics), what the developers really got was the feel. The feel is so smooth.\n\nSome platformers have double jumping. This game let's you double jump to infinity. Just tap tap tap. There is no fall damage. Ever. But there are lots of spiked surfaces and spinning blades to avoid.\n\nThis game has swords. And armor. And shields. And axes. And spiked clubs. And magic daggers. Oh, and flamethrowers. God do I love those flamethrowers.\n\nThere are some wacky quests that will abruptly interrupt your game, sometimes with mini in game cinematics.\n\nI'm still trying to figure out why this game is so great. But it really is. Despite my suckage based aversion to platformers, I actually find this game relaxing.\n\nAt the current sale price of $1.24, you'd be a fool not to pick up this gem. I forget what I paid for it during the holiday sale. It sat in my backlog for a while. But I'd even consider it at the full $5.", "timestamp_created": 1488520709, "timestamp_updated": 1488521011, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.664439", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30275372": {"recommendationid": "30275372", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047015315", "num_games_owned": 1246, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 8046, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497679144}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6253\u62985\u5757\u94b1\u5165\u7684,\u5c45\u7136\u51fa\u4e4e\u610f\u6599\u7684\u597d\u73a9\u54c7~\n\u771f\u7684\u5f88\u6709\u610f\u601d,\u5c45\u7136\u80fd\u8ba9\u6211\u8fd9\u79cd\u624b\u6b8b\u73a9\u5bb6\u73a9\u5230\u505c\u4e0d\u4e0b\u6765..\u8d85\u503c(\u00af\ufe43\u00af)\n\u6700\u540e,\u6253\u6b7b\u4e0d\u6740\u55b5QwQ", "timestamp_created": 1488450297, "timestamp_updated": 1488450297, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.630632", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30272671": {"recommendationid": "30272671", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998784855", "num_games_owned": 94, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 1083, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488696189}, "language": "english", "review": "More satisfying shieldplay than Skyrim.

You buy them because you're looking for something like this.\nI can't really say enough good things about this game. I've had it for a while now and I always come back to it, sometimes for a few minutes before or after work, or if I get a good run going it can easily turn into a couple hours.\n\nBasically you kill enemies in randomly generated dungeon levels, find the key to the exit, proceed to the next level. The farther you go, the stronger and more numerous the enemies.\n\nThe controls are quite simple, move, jump, attack, block.\n\nThe artwork is fairly basic, but the color palette is pleasing to the eye, which is the key to good pixel art IMO.\n\nThe loot system is great. There's several different weapons with very different functions (Grenades are great fun but also the cause of many of my deaths), and several different quality tiers, each with more randomly generated stats than the last. This is one of the main things that keeps the game interesting for me.\n\nIf you think this is something you might enjoy, give it a shot. I'm almost certain you'll get your money's worth.

Tallowmere is not a \"bad\" game, but it is an extremely limited one in terms of scope and long-term playability. That may seem like a strange statement to make for a $5 game, granted, but it's not one made mindlessly. The core of rogue-like and rogue-lite experiences is, beyond any specific mechanics, largely down to two concepts: \"differentiation between runs\" and \"core gameplay solid enough to encourage many runs\". \n\nThose two areas are crucial to any rogue-like or rogue-lite, and Tallowmere is rather lacking in both.\n\nWhat the game does right:\n[list]\n    [*]Each of the eight weapon types play very differently, and encourage different approaches to areas and enemies.\n    [*]The graphics, while rather primitive, are passable.\n    [*]The few bosses that exist are a welcome reprieve from the usual suspects.\n    [*]Allowing the player to alter the difficulty, either through additional health or more drastic (negative) modifiers at will was a strong design choice.\n    [*]Finding different weapons and armor provides an incentive, however small, to keep playing. \n[/list]\n\nWhat it does wrong:\n[list]\n    [*]There are very few enemy types, significantly reducing any sense of discovery through a run.\n    [*]The environment around the player shifts things like stage hazards, but never changes significantly in appearance. Eventually, everything blurs together. \"Hello, grey everything. No, no. You may have been in every room in the entire dungeon, but you're not boring. I just think maybe we should see other tilesets...\"\n    [*]There are no real goals to pursue other than \"get to a farther, near-identical room, increasing your standing on functionally meaningless leaderboards\". \n[/list]\n\nThe end result of all those design decisions is a game that I would not describe as \"bad\" so much as \"bland\". Tallowmere is mechanically decent, but hampered at every turn by its extremely limited scope of design. After a few runs, the lack of variety involved kills all motivation to continue playing.\n\nSo, do I recommend it? In comparison to other rogue-likes/rogue-lites on the market, absolutely not. In a general sense, still not really. If, however, you are content with a very limited experience, and merely want to kill an hour or two here and there? In that specific case, yes. Likewise, if \"higher score\" is all the gameplay motivation you need, Tallowmere has that covered. \n\nFor me, personally, it was not enough.

Now with all of the achievements gotten, I wanted to do a quick review over here. Now let's start!\n...\n...\nYes, the intro is short and not very informative, but I'm writing this at 12:28 AM, what are you expecting?\n\nActual review:\n\n[*]What is this game? Just what it advertises from its long-ass trailer: a rogue-like platformer where you explore rocket launchers and shoot stuff with dungeons. Simple, yet... well nah, that's pretty simple, mate, pretty simple. Did I mention the trailer is unnecesarilly long?\n\n[*]The gameplay consists of a never-before seen elements before: platformers and rogue-likes. Never have I ever heard one of these combos before(coughSpelunkyRogueLegacyRiskofRaincough). With that out of the way, you esentially guide your hero through a never ending room generator, splicing/chopping/burning/booming your way to the top of your personal leaderboard. You also have a shield, which blocks damage from upfront and the interesting mechanic of infinite jumps. If this does not sound enjoyable enough, you can pretty much attack your foes at the speed of sound. That means god speed already. If this still did not leave your mouth watering, then we move to the next point.\n\n[*]While progressing through the game, you will need to upgrade yourself, and the loot you get will mark your run a LOT. The diversity in weapons is surpisingly big, not that I have the same thing to say about clothing, headgear and shields, but if I have to take some picks, if you haven't seen the trailer already, daggers that make you invisible, katanas that teleport you like a maniac and rocket launchers 'cuz why not.\n\nThe weapons are the icing on the cake for me, as every start with different weapons makes you change the playstyle and I love that! Not only that, but as you progress from room to room, you will need some upgrades, and here come the tiers in play: from uncommon to other-wordly, these tiers offer the weapons and armor all sorts of different stats, from simple resistances to health on kill, health regen etc. What I do not like is the fact how all of these stats are the same for everything. What do I mean by this is like, sure you have this dagger that grants hp on kill, but this shirt does the same thing too. You can also have resistances on the dagger and increased damage on the shirt, makes no sense. At all. In my opinion this was outright lazy, but hey, it's stackable, so I don't really brag too much on it. Just throwing my 2 cents in there.\n\n[*]Moving on to the enemies, all I can say is \"few, but diverse enough\".\n\nA problem I seem to keep stumbling on in rogue-likes is the amount of powers the mobs have. For some examples are being how many reskined stats chasing enemies you can encounter, ranging from low health chasing enemy to high hp chasing enemy. That kind of problem is only to blame on the devs' lack of ideas, and that's not a thing we have to be ashamed of, we all run out of original concepts at some point, yet creativity is always replenishable(in most cases anyway). Back to Tallowmere, the enemies here are well designed, ranging from simple archers to huge ugly insects that catch you with your tongue and drag you half a kilometer to it and their thousand of friends below them. Heh.\n\nThere is a catch here though, and that is some of the room generations. The RNG in this game is to make rooms with either a lot of nothingness or a lot of corridors and blocks, and some of the enemy placements can outright fuck you up, and not having corresponsive loot, you can wave that run goodbye. While you can still be very resistant to normal enemies, the champion ones are dangerous and a high priority target in your eyes at all time. These guys are normal enemies that glow red, are a bit bigger in size and deal more damage coming up with a x10 on their health bar, too. If there is one thing that can end your run in this game, it's these guys, and let me tell you, some champions are terrifying(leapers beware ;-;). \n\nThere are also bosses in this game, and what can I say? Use the shield a lot and just spam the rocket launcher and GG.\n\n[*]The lobby might not seem the most interesting of areas, but many things can happen here, such as:\n-Challenges! One suited fellow will like to get you on a wild ride of \"x weapon\" only runs or even some disabled stats.\n-Challenges of death! These aren't necesarilly challenges on their own, but they do affect your normal runs, which include no hp regening(ever), less damage, more enemies, more champions etc.\n-Kitty cats! If you suck at the game, you can take one of these cute kitties on your journey to wonderland! Just kidding, you take them out and gut them to death. But hey, you get +10 hp for every kitty slain! You sick fuck.\n-And lastly, Lady Tallowmere! She is a more interesting character, as if you have the chance, you can go back to her when hurt and she will fully heal you. I say interesting, as a lot of rogue-likes tend to be tough as balls, with random health drops and what not, but having the opportunity to leave your enemies as damaged as they are and you to return with full strength is just lovely in my eyes, I really enjoyed this concept, and I still do.\n\n\ntl;dr This was a quite short review, if you read this first you're a lazy person. But, let's say you're in a hurry for some reason and you want the verdict: Tallowmere is a game that gave me what I expected, and that is what it advertised. While some room generations can be a real downer and the game is played pretty slowly, each particular weapon feels fantastic to use, the item effects can turn tides and I can't stop smiling from using the rocket launcher. Ah, yes, I forgot to add the fact how you can shoot a rocket launcher at the speed of sonic. It is not satisfying, but very satisfying. Overall, Tallowmere gets an 8.5/10 from me. Perhaps it'll go to to a 9 once I try the android version, which I cannot wait, but for now I can't say I regret buying this game at full price, and I recommend both casual and hardcore parties on getting this whenever possible.\n\nThis has been your random reviewer, signing off, and have a nice day! Or night or whatever, I just want to sleep now.

You run through procedurally generated dungeon rooms one by one, slaying the enemies to drop a key to the next room. It sounds simple enough, but it gets very intense the more you go in. The game can quickly run from walk-in-the-park to hair-pulling difficult in the time of one room change, and when you die... You're dead for good, having to start over from square one. One of the really neat things I've seen in this game is how the random generation doesn't apply only to items/equipment and the dungeon rooms themselves, but also to the objectives. In one playthrough, the 7th floor required me to slay the mighty Hydra, while the second runthrough I was asked to retrieve Lady Tallowmere's flag. This is a really nice thought by the dev, as it keeps it more interesting in terms of what you have to accomplish to advance throughout Tallowmere's brutish dungeon. This is a very fun game that has hours upon hours of playability in it, and I'd recommend it to anyone who loves Rogue-likes, Rogue-lites, and Metroidvania-style RPGs.

It can get repetetive quickly, but the same is true of pretty much all roguelikes and games in general, and relatively speaking this lasts longer than some of the others I've tried.\nIt's got the FTL problem where it's more like a fruit machine than a game at times; if you don't get good items soon, you're completely screwed. On the other hand, its timing-based gameplay means that even with the most terrible items, it's POSSIBLE to get really far into the game. It's fun.\n\nThat said, I have one complaint, and one desire. I'd like to reorder my quick-item choosing. You can reorder the weapon wheel, but I prefer scrolling through my items, and I'd rather choose the emerald dagger to be directly next to the flamethrower, or a health-regen weapon next to my primary weapon. I'd like to remove some items from my next-weapon bar thingy, since I don't want to waste that extra second looking for the weapon I need.\n\nMy desire, of course, is more variety. Areas should change over time - say, the deeper you get the darker it becomes, or the more dirt, cracks and stuff become apparent in the walls. Stuff like that, to make it feel like I'm actually progressing. A number and more hits per enemy isn't really enough. Boss variety is good as well - perhaps a boss that attacks indirectly. Regular enemies should also really be more varied - I love (by which I mean I HATE) the flying mofo that drags you to it, because it really affects how you approach combat - if you don't pay attention, you could be beating a stunner to death when it grabs you and gives him an opening to stun you, giving everyone else an opening to curbstomp you.

games, even though most of them end up pretty bad. The reason I do this is because every so often, I find a game like Tallowmere!\n\nI absolutely love this game. It's equal parts fun and frustrating. You really learn and develop your tactics the more you play. You have to figure out the best way to use your weapons, and what weapon is the right weapon to use in any given situation, and even once you've learned that, you have to be careful not to get too cocky or careless, because mistakes can kill!\n\nThere's nothing better than the thrill of demolishing enemies with the katana, or raining grenades down upon the unsuspecting mobs below, or sneaking up behind and stabbing an enemy with an emerald dagger. You find a rocket launcher for the first time and go nuts with it! Then you realize that the subtleties of the ice wand are sometimes preferable, even if the wand doesn't have the launcher's range.\n\nYou die. You die again. You curse the mobs and you curse yourself for not being good enough to get past the mobs yet, or making a stupid mistake. You quit the game in frustration. But then you go back, because you know you can take everything you've learned and make it a little further next time, and sure enough, you do!\n\nIt's so wonderfully retro in that it's the sort of game that you just have to keep working and working to perfect your reactions, your tactics, your skills. It's brutally unforgiving when you mess up, but your willingness to soldier on and learn from those mistakes is rewarded when you post a new top score on your personal scoreboard.

They exist, but I haven't really felt the need to use them.\n+Weapon Variety: There are several classes of weapons that (despite their incongruency with each other and/or the game's hardly-there theming) are actually pretty unique when compared to each other.\n-Cheap Shots: There are two actual threats to you in this game: Ogres that throw purple stunning potions, and Elite enemies, which take much longer to kill and do a lot more damage. This is how Tallowmere does difficulty.\n-Enemies, or, a lack thereof. There are maybe seven enemy types in this game. They all do one thing, and have no other features other than that.\n-A lack of direction. There's a character called Lady Tallowmere. She has a dangerous dungeon. You go into it. That's it. OH NO SHE GETS KIDNAPPED! Oh you just rescued her. Oh look, weird potions on the ground that do inexplicable things. They're gone by the next room.

Impressions...\n\nTallowmere is one of the better pixel art rogue-lite games that I have played.  The game is very accessible in the various options and gameplay areas.  If you find the game too hard, sacrifice some kittens and get 10 more HP per kitten killed!  Yeah, yeah!!!  It's a terrible thought, but it works well for this game.  IMO, the dev's made a rogue-lite game that works for many levels of gamers!  That is a great feat in it's own right!  If you find the game is not hard enough, there are a ton of options you can turn on or off.  The game is very configurable and that makes it fun for a lot of people.\n\nThe graphics are good for a pixel art game and look better if you turn on Anti-Aliasing.  They have a flat look to them during the turning animations, but this is not developer laziness, but part of the graphical charm of the game.  The controls are very tight and you have full control over your character during jumps.

It is a great idea in theory but 4 things make this game a DON'T BUY:\n\n1) The animation is truly terrible. This is coming from somebody whose first video game system was an Atari 2600! Video game sprites from the 80's had 2 frames of animation for movement. 30 years later, we can offer at least that much! With almost zero animation (but the odd super-cool flame or blood effect), it feels less like a video game and more like a comic book with no dialogue or storyline. It removes a lot of the fun and immersion. Original roguelikes have zero animation as well but they have a lot more depth in their mechanics, which I will get into later.\n\n2) If the animation is not there, at least give me some variety in enemy attacks. Most enemies are just long-range attackers and that makes each run incredibly dependent on weapon drops. The grenade and rocket-launcher are so useful and everything else...not so much. The other weapons each have glaring weaknesses and your game is reduced to spamming grenades and rockets from an extremely far and safe distance. If that is the gameplay, I really don't need monsters and shields and tactics. I can just shoot rockets and grenades into an empty pit and listen to the explosions, right? Shallow mechanics.\n\n3) The dungeons have a random layout, so nothing was designed with playability in mind. This sounds like it will always be fresh but it is often frustrating because you cannot see what you are walking into and you can end up dead in an instant. You can move slowly to avoid trouble but you can easily trigger an impossible situation where your death is nearly guaranteed unless you slaughter all monsters in an instant or make an amazing escape. Of course, this won't happen if you just carpetbomb all open spaces with grenades and rockets.\n\n4)  No static unlocks. This is easily the worst part of Tallowmere and it kills the game. Playing a game that starts over from the beginning every time is fine if it is an arcade experience. But arcade experiences do not have random death from procedurally-generated dungeons. Imagine if you put a quarter into an arcade machine and the game randomly just blew up your ship after 2-5 seconds? If you cannot save the game and no levels or gear or stats carry over, you need some sort of progression via learning the game. Even a fighting game that has no saves and random enemy strategies doesn't have random enemy attacks. Chun-Li's kicks will not suddenly do more damage because she is a randomly \"higher-level/big-head\" Chun-Li. \n\nTL;DR The challenge is supposed to be random, not the fun.", "timestamp_created": 1426042044, "timestamp_updated": 1426042044, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547897", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14831132": {"recommendationid": "14831132", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042782024", "num_games_owned": 224, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 489, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485325370}, "language": "english", "review": "do you like doing the same thing over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again?

The only thing stopping you from running full-tilt into all danger is the presense of ogres who throw stunning potions that home in on you and never ever miss ever, requiring you to use the shield, but since you can buy 5 minute stun-proofing potions for half a ha'penny they're not an issue either at later levels.\n\n No weapons have attacking speeds, they go as fast as you can mash the attack button (which is the left arrow key for no discernable reason) so there's really no reason to not nuke every room with a rocket launcher and grenades from several lightyears away. Boss monsters include a giant cat who fires shots that you have to block before you attack, a giant flying robot which requires you to block his shots and then attack, and a giant three-headed hydra that has you blocking shots and then attacking. You can see we have a very diverse spread there.\n\n The first 25-30 floors have events sprinkled throughout them to make them interesting but after that the next 20 or so  have nothing but more empty space and more of the same seven monsters to fight, three of which do nearly the exact same thing and two of which that do the exact same thing entirely. I also wasn't kidding about empty space because the levels are completely 100% randomly generated and a lot of the time it's nothing but a giant room full of enemies shooting undodgable lightning and stun potions. The generator for the levels is painfully lazy as well, traps can be placed in any spot, so when a giant circular saw is in the middle of a hallway with no way around it you're just going to have to take a hit. Additionally, the generator isn't polished enough to make levels that would always be completable with a finite jump height so they just made it so you can jump eternally like you're using a game genie instead of actually putting effort into improving level layout.\n\n When I got to hour two of this game I thought to myself, \"This is actually pretty good for an early access title,\" but then I remembered that this is supposed to be a fully completed game and I began to furiously rub my temples in shame and regret.

The graphics are so crisp and lovely to look at. The gameplay, at least to me, feels like a bit of a mix between Rogue Legacy and (at least the combat in) Terraria. The combat is very satisfying. You can attack as quickly as you can click the mouse/ press the button. \n\nThe game works really nicely with a controller, and although it feels like a lot of multitasking at first, you'll quickly get the hang of smashing foes from left to right all the while using your (might I say) vital shield to protect you from incoming attacks.\n\nThe movement is incrediby fluid. While I would like it if the shield switched directions if you press different directions, it does make some things easier, such as backing away from enemies. \n\nThere appears to be quite a number of weapons, all the ones that I have used so far have been really neat and responsive. \n\nThis is definitely a high quality rogue-like game which I think will share the same pedestal as some of the greats currently available. It doesn't feel like a cheap game, which makes it more than worth the price considering some of the features such as randomly generated rooms that get bigger and more challenging as you progress. There's a lot of loot, a lot of waypoints for you to teleport quickly to be healed entirely for free and then return, all within a few seconds. \n\nThis game has so much of what I look for in a rogue-like; number 1 being replay value. The dungeons are apparently endless, so you basically just progress as far as you can before submitting to your inevitable fate. \n\nThere is also infinite jumping and lots of sparkles.

Check out my video review![/url][/u]\n\nPros:\n_Game plays really really well: The combat is really satisfying because your character attacks as quickly as you tap the button. Jumping is floaty but you can do it indeffinitely (so it's like your character just have a jetpack on all the time). Blocking is instantanious and feels precise. Overall, this game plays like a dream.\n_Good sounds: Music is barren but manage to never feel repetitive or annoying. The \"voices\" (which are just made up of random tones, kind of like Animal Crossing's voices) are also really charming.\n_Random rooms: Every room is randomly generated. So if you're into that, then you're into that.\n_Great weapons: The weapons aren't just reskins. Every type of weapon you pick up alter the way you play the game rather drastically. For example, picking up the Katana will allow you to teleport to enemies when you attack.\n\nCons:\n_Looks kinda bad: if you just judge this game on screenshots alone, you won't want it. The game looks bad, especially the environment. Animation is bare-boned as well, but that might be there to highlight the responsiveness of your attacks.\n\nPros/Cons:\n_You can sacrifice kittens to gain health. Yup. You can do that.\n\nOverall, you'll like this game if:\n_You like 2D sidescroller that focuses more on combat than platforming.\n_You like Rogue-likes.\n_You can look pass the janky graphics.\n\nIs it worth $15? It absolutely is worth 15 bucks. Wait, what do you mean it's only $5? IT'S 5 BUCKS? WHY AREN'T YOU BUYING IT ALREADY?\n\nShameless plugs time! Did you like my review? I do more than just that.

The dungeon rooms are randomly generated, as are the items and weapons that you'll find inside the chests throughout which means that no 2 runs are ever the same. The game never takes itself too seriously and the dialogue is generally pretty funny because of it. There is an interesting system where you have the option of, ummm, sacrificing kittens to grant yourself more base health. While this makes the game easier on the player, it places your end score in a different ladder. A neat little twist on difficulty adjustment in my opinion.\n\nOverall, I rate this game an 8 out of 10. I'd go higher if it were for the totally obnoxious yellow gas cloud traps that are rampant throughout and if the enemy AI was a bit stronger. All in all though this is a fun game and for under $5, I totally recommend it.

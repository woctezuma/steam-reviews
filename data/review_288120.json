Not every system and challenge has to be tweaked just right, they have to be fun to work through. Dungeonmans gets that, and perhaps gets it better than almost any other roguelike out there. I started my adventures skeptical of the traditional mechanics and limited skills and sudden difficulty spikes, and soon found myself not wanting to stop. It doesn\u2019t all fit together perfectly, but it fits together in a ridiculously fun way that I can\u2019t seem to quit.\n\nGuess what a dungeonmans is? It\u2019s a mans that raids dungeons, of course! You\u2019re responsible for an entire academy of aspiring dungeonmans, in fact, playing as their newest graduate on a quest to defeat some vague evil vaguely off to the southeast. Your journeys across the procedural world and into the procedural dungeons will yield loot for your mans and artifacts for your academy, increasing the former\u2019s odds of survival and the latter\u2019s capacity to aid future dungeonmans when your current one inevitably expires. And perhaps by building up the academy to legendary stature, you will one day cultivate a mans great enough to raid that final dungeon.\n\nAt the core of Dungeonmans is a wholly traditional turn-based roguelike, inspired by the ASCII deathtraps of yore. You scoot your mans across a grid of dungeon tiles, bumping into foes to defeat them and hoovering up the loot that drops. In place of letters and numbers are lovingly-rendered sprites of burly men, gooey slimes, and piles of coin. You\u2019ll never misunderstand what you\u2019re facing thanks to the detailed art and striking particle effects that highlight bosses and add real weight to the skills being thrown around. Screen shakes and massive explosions give Dungeonmans far more life than any game of NetHack you\u2019ve played.\n\nLively too are the dialogues and item descriptions you\u2019ll find no shortage of in your travels. As the name suggests, Dungeonmans takes a tongue-in-cheek approach to traditional dungeon diving on every level. Your foes include gelatinous geometry, bees that literally practice carpentry, giant pangolins, and cockney hooligans. Equipment is crafted from the finest Burlylium and Crushonium, yielding enchanted beatsticks and gladiator skirts. And every line spoken by you or anyone in the game is dripping with sarcasm and wit. It\u2019s the kin of humor that could grate over time, but is smartly relegated to item descriptions and dialogues between dungeon runs, never overpowering the core gameplay.\n\nWhat does impinge on the gameplay are some of the unpleasant holdovers of the genre. Roguelikes are tricky things to balance, especially coming from its dark and brutal originators. The top killer of your dungeonmans will no doubt be difficulty spikes, usually champion monsters far beefier and deadlier than the chaff you\u2019ll cut through to reach them. Those with elemental attacks are the worst, because you probably won\u2019t be paying much attention to resistances (or really know how to raise them starting out). The game certainly tries to warn you with general difficulty levels posted for areas of the world, combat log observations about powerful enemies, and glowing auras singling out bosses. But you\u2019re still not going to know how you stack up until you go toe-to-toe, and by then it can easily be too late for your poor mans.\n\nThere are other annoyances to single out, like the item ID system that really just wastes your time (complete with an enemy that can UN-ID your items!) or the occasionally lengthy animations that break up the flow of turn-based combat. But despite these issues, I can barely stop myself from playing long enough to get angry about them. Even when I die after hours on a particular mans, I find myself immediately considering my next character. And that\u2019s because what Dungeonmans does right is boil down roguelike combat to only the best parts, and layer loads of rewards over them. The skill system is limited in a smart way, leaving you just the core skills and passives you want for your style of mans. Combat can pass in a flash, enemies drop loads of loot, and the visual effects are lush and satisfying.\n\nThen when the last foe falls and the blood pool on the cold dungeon floor, you haul your loot back to the academy and set about building the next generation of dungeonmans. Books, artifacts, and equipment can be donated to supply later characters. Gear can be melted down to make upgrades for current or future mans. Combat stats are tracked for the many enemy types in the game. And Proofs of Stremf persist between characters, allowing new mans to start with greatly improved stats. You can also upgrade towns you come across to access better shop items, or track down the final resting places of your previous mans for significant bonuses.\n\nAbove all, Dungeonmans is a game that wants to be played at your pace. The design of the random overworld gives you general difficulties for areas, and if a dungeon feels to hard you can always escape and shake down easier ones for better loot and more XP. Different dungeon and encounter types also offer different rewards so you can focus on developing however you want. And the overworld persists between characters so you don\u2019t have to keep re-exploring, although you can always re-generate the world while keeping your academy if you\u2019re so inclined. Any complaints about the game pale in light of how solid the core design is and how robust the progression can be. I expect to be dungeon diving with my mans for quite some time, with ever more to see and crush as the hours pass in a happy daze.\n\n\n\nDid you enjoy this review?

You can also choose to have a single life and character should you desire a more traditional experience.\n\nYou can expect to run into plenty of jokes and puns which keep the game lighthearted and relaxed when it comes to the presentation. You should take the time to read the enemy and item descriptions. There are some knee-slappers waiting to be found.\n\nYou can also expect turn-based combat with grid-style 8-direction movement. You can use the arrow keys, the numpad, or the mouse to move out of the way of certain death. It helps that the GUI is generally clean and clear. You're not going to be making many mistakes because you couldn't tell what was happening on the screen despite all the spells, buffs, and debuffs happening.\n\nWhere the game really shines is how it handles progression with leveling up. If you ever dreamed of making an archer that uses a wizard's energy shield while also being able to dual-wield two swords and drop banners that provide buffs, this game will let you do that. The ability to pick and choose skills from different classes make customization both interesting and wacky. You'll eventually have all the key skills for your preferred playstyle once you learn not to die and have the chance to branch out to try different things. \n\nThe academy part of the game kept me coming back for me. The meta-progression is dependent on you bringing back relics to the headmaster. That can result in new functions for the academy such as automatically identified items, crafting recipes, powerful item storage, random item drops that can be redeemed by a successor, and more. The super important one are the \"Proofs of Stremf\" which help both your current and future characters purchase stat increases at the trainer. You'll always come back stronger unless you royally mess up a run.\n\nThe only problems I have with the game are certain strong enemies that can \"one-shot\" you. Most of the time, they'll have a tell with the red zones indicating an incoming attack. Those situations are live and learn, but some of those red incoming attacks you can survive without an issue and you won't really know which one is the truly lethal one. I kind of wish those extremely high damage attacks had a purple zone or something different. Maybe I'm missing something. Dodge everything.\n\nAnyway, the bigger problem in my experience are parry chains. Normally, parries are great and let you attack the enemy during their turn. Later in the game, certain enemy types will come at you with their own high parry chance, which lets them parry your parry. However, you can then parry their parry. And they'll be able to parry that one and so on. It leads to an uncontrollable exchange of blows that can go on until the death of you or them. It also cost me my last character's life which soured me quite a bit since the monster hit me back for a surprising 400 and 1600 damage. I never understood what happened exactly there.... Anyway, the back and forth parry brawling happens far too frequently. I used to think of parry as a positive stat, but then also considered trying to make it deliberately low just to be able to control damage intake.\n\nStill, Dungeonmans is my current #1 rogue-like, dethroning Dungeons of Dredmor (I stick with the more friendly ones).

Imagine Rogue Legacy, but as a ToME-style Roguelike instead of Metroidvania, and you pretty much got it. Personally it just didn't last for me. It is not a fault of the game, but of the genre it created. The hallmark of a roguelike to me is being able to consistently win if you have skill. This game will brutally kill you for no reason, and you are supposed to shrug, spend your stuff to make the next character a little stronger, then go again. Builds are also rather shallow and I found myself struggling to try anything new or interesting beyond the obvious.\n\nUltimately what killed it for me is that it was just too easy for 99 percent of it, then I'd run into some bullcrap boss like a Warlord that still oneshot what I thought was a very powerful character. I got sick of spending a couple hours to probably die on a random boss that took 1,000 turns to die and only got difficult due to complacence or RNG. I was hoping there would be a way to skip to a certain level and just play challenging content. There's a brief zone between a very dangerous  new group of monsters and potentially being weak that I enjoyed, but that went away pretty quickly with the global buffs you gain from doing runs.\n\nWould I recommend it? 30ish hours for 15 bucks is a good deal for me, so yes, because Steam doesn't have a 'neutral' option.

Fun, but simple. I wouldn't call it exceptionally complex in terms combat or character options, but you do need to keep a tactical mind as you're making choices. They do a good job at offering risky rewards, and do a good job at rewarding moderate risks while killing those too aggressive. Honestly, this is the game I wanted ToME to be. \n\nThere are a few scary bugs (software ones I mean... I guess both but I'm not talking about the other kind here). There's a tower with a big purple warlord with lots of scripting that works maybe half the time. He's supposed to have 2 forms, but sometimes he just dies after the first form leaving you with no way out of the tower (except escape-scroll). Also, I had a hero die in the final dungeon once. When I beat that part of the dugeon with a new hero and came to take my loot out, it said \"completed!\" over the final dungeon, and I thought \"oh no, have I broken the entire game right at the end?\" but fortunately, the final bossfight still worked.\n\nAnd the game will lag and occasionally crash when alot's happening. I see slowdown when alot of mobs are on fire around me (happens alot to us dungeonmans), and both castles and temples seem to have major slowdown, I suspect cuz they have huge floors and enemies need to path through em. There has been an update to \"improve performance\" a while back. I've still seen slowdowns, but no crashs since then, but I also think my old weapon choice may have agroed enemies all over the map, so I'm not sure which is the solution. \n\nOne final warning though... as far as I can tell, there is like no documentation out there. The wiki's garbage, there's no useful guides, and after beating it, I think there are still mechanics I never figured out. I never checked the discord stuff, so maybe it's there, but steam and google have not helped me unlock the secrets of dungeonmans.\n\nAnother final warning... this is one of those games where you can dump 10 hours into a character and be insti-killed by something you've never seen. So my warning to highlevel but inexperienced dungeonmans: Be careful of bee's damage reflection, and there is a miniboss in the final dungeon with an attack you cannot tank (if he kills you with it, it doesn't mean you were unprepared, it just means you made a tactical boo-boo.)\n\nI would advise waiting to see if you can get it at like 1/2 off or something, but otherwise it's a good game if you're willing to work around the issues.

This was a mistake on my part.\n\nDungeonmans is a love letter to old school dungeon crawl games. I love the way it playfully deconstructs the genre and all its tropes while still maintaining the feel that has kept me playing RPGs and roguelikes for so many years.\n\nWhat I like: \n[list]\n[*]You create your own character from scratch. No being shoehorned into someone else's idea of what you should play.\n[*]Open world/sandbox style. Go where you want, when you want. If you want to clear the game one dungeon at a time, go for it. If you just want to loot and run, you can do that too.\n[*]The game adapts to your playing style. You can build the academy and make each of your characters more powerful than the last, or you can go Ironmans and challenge the game without all those perks.\n[*]Death in this game usually feels like something you could have avoided, so you can usually learn from your mistakes and get better at avoiding them.\n[*]The developer is still active in the community, taking player feedback and patching out bugs.\n[/list]\nWhat I don't like:\n[list]\n[*]There are places where the game will troll you with one-shot deaths. It usually does a good job of telegraphing these, but there is still the occasional bug that does this unintentionally.\n[*]The in-game descriptions for some of the skills are a bit vague, sometimes only hinting at what the skill will accomplish for you. Some rewording may be in order.\n[*]I feel that this game would benefit greatly from full controller support. I can get basic movement and attacks to work, but I can not for the life of me figure out how to put skills into the cross-bars for use with my controller.\n[*]There are some immersion-breaking bugs in a certain tower than genuinely confused me, and not in the fun \"it's an RPG puzzle, you're supposed to figure it out\" kind of way.\n[/list]\nOverall, the developer has done a very good job with this game. If you enjoy single player RPGs, the dungeon crawl theme, and the roguelike experience I recommend buying it now. If you're not sure you'll enjoy it, buy it now anyway.\n\nProtip: if you have the patience for it, this game is best enjoyed spoiler free, at least for your first few attempts.", "timestamp_created": 1497109466, "timestamp_updated": 1497110281, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510923", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32319660": {"recommendationid": "32319660", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046685460", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 15032, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498011560}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm still playing this game after 2 years.

I love a lot of the design decisions in this game. My understanding of the game's mechanics, how its presented, and the difficulty curve has allowed me to overcome many seemingly random elements relatively quickly.

If you play the \"normal\" way for Dungeonmans, your characters still die permanently (so much so that you can't re-use the name) but the progress at your Dungeonmans Academy can be used to start your next character with a boost. This is the way I've been playing and it's been quite enjoyable. I just lost a level 8 Lady Dungeonmans and will be starting over again soon. It's a fun game and if you have any interest in Roguelikes, you should definitely pick this up. Doubly so if it's on sale at 50% off.\n\nWhen the latest update was pushed, there was some sort of error that caused many players' games to crash.

Enemy types are varied, and many have abilities that move themselves or you across the battlefield to keep things fresh. And honestly it works well as a roguelike.\n\nI really, really want to recommend this game.\n\nBut I can't in good conscience, because it feels half-finished, like an early access game. And the developers show no signs they want to fix anything.\n\nFirst off, there's bugs all over the place. Both big and small, including some that wreck people's save files. There's also lots of stuff (especially in the late game) that is missing its description because they never got around to it.\n\nGame balance is also wonky. The defensive stats do practically nothing for your defense early on but makes you virtually invincible at high levels, except against a few specific enemies with specific spells. Some skills do virtually nothing but act as as stepping stones to more important skills, or are hideously weak compared to skills that are available earlier. You can tell at a glance that some character perks are stronger than others. The graveyard dungeons have way too high a loot-to-risk ratio. Many bosses are pushovers, except the final boss who has an instant-kill attack (yes, in a roguelike).

If you like Dungeons of Dredmor, it's similar to that. Only this game is a lot more smooth than Dredmor. I really enjoy the simple humor in the game. I've laughed quite a few times.

It's easy to die if you go too fast, which is also easy to do considering how fast paced this game can be despite it being turn-based. Each hero can help improve your next game, which in my opinion is a good idea to implement in a rogue-like game. $10 might seem more fair of a price, however I don't know how long the game goes for. But there's obviously lots of replayability as it is a rogue-like. Decent amount of variety in gear and traits. Artstyle is good. I think overall for what it is it's a great game.

The class and leveling system, though simple, was enjoyable.  The randomly generated world was a great feature for replayability and the legacy system capped it off with an academy that gets upgraded by your heroes exploits and offers perks to future heroes after your each one dies.  Unfortunately, the game seemed to quickly lose its luster when I realized that the difficulty seems quite easy for a legacy rogue-like.\n\nThe game begins with your character graduating from your academy.  You will select their stat package from several randomly generated ones and then choose your class.  From this point on, you'll adventure through a procedurally generated world that is done decently well, though it could use a bit more variety throughout.  Acquiring special items will improve your academy and the benefits that it offers to your future graduates are exciting to unlock as is finding stolen goods that you can return to a town of your choice to boost their prosperity.  This will in turn make that town have a more effective stock of items that are sold at cheaper prices.\n\nIn theory, this all adds up to a great game.  That changes quickly, however, once you realize that the game is fairly easy, especially when you consider that as a legacy rogue-like, a large part of its charm is death and moving on to your next hero.  With this foundation a bit shaky, the game's excitement waned rather quickly as the variety for a single hero seemed to be lacking.  I've now played multiple hours on the same character and, whenever a true threat revealed itself, I was either able to escape or outsmart it rather easily without ever being at risk of death.\n\nIf Dungeonmans were in Early Access, I would give it a positive review as it lacks enough content to keep me playing on a single player and also the difficulty to facilitate me moving through the generations of my academy.  However, it does have a very strong foundation if the developer were to continue adding content and it has peaked my interest enough that I will be coming back to try the game again in the future and will change my review accordingly if it improves.  However, I currently do not recommend this game if only due to the fact that Dungeons of Dredmor is a superior game in the RPG rogue-like category and Rogue Legacy is a strong platformer/RPG rogue-like with an impressive legacy system.", "timestamp_created": 1483066111, "timestamp_updated": 1483066111, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 30, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.658445", "comment_count": "7", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28756655": {"recommendationid": "28756655", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061706758", "num_games_owned": 196, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 876, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512084813}, "language": "english", "review": "Good funny roguelike.

You'll find that the dungeons you explored initially will all be procedurally randomized again!\n\nWhoo, okay, so! -\n\nDungeonmans is essentially a Rogue-like with a persistent world. You essentially make a seed for a randomly seeded world map, and then spawn your character into it from the Dungeonmans Academy (more on this later). From there you venture out into the world clobbering enemies and likely eventually getting clobbered yourself! When you die, your remains will remain in the level of the world where you died (unless you get to a high enough level, in which case something else happens); and you will have to make a new character to spawn into the world with.\n\nSpawning into the world again, you will find that the world map is the same, though there will be some negative effects from your last characters death. Bandits will have set upon the roads and towns, and towns you invested in on prior run(s), dungeons you visited will be randomized to feature new layouts to re-explore, and the remains of your prior adventurer will be around to collect loot and experience from.\n\nAnd that pretty much sums up what this game is all about above. But there is more - and unfortunately, not all that good....\n\nEssentially, if your character gets to a specific level, you can retire your character. Retiring your character you might go and opening an inn, go back to teach further recruits of the dungeonmans academy some learned tricks from your retired character, or just go about wandering.\n\nThe key problem here though is that is leads to a situation where you'll be doing unfun things like 'farming' characters to level 10 to retire so that you can essentially make better and better dungeonman characters to do things with.\n\nNow, as a note, this game does now have an Ironmans mode as of this review, but playing on a single run will have a very generic rogue-like experience that gets away from what the gameplay of dungeomans is really all about - a persistent world.\n\nThis is one of the odd rogue-likes that I both 'recommend' but give a wary warning about. It is a really interesting example of a rogue-like because it has that persistent world concept, and it is worth experiencing because it is really neat.\n\nHowever, because of the farming factor present, this is also a game I would suggest avoiding if you want a game you could really sink your teeth into and enjoy", "timestamp_created": 1481590029, "timestamp_updated": 1481590029, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.605922", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28298218": {"recommendationid": "28298218", "author": {"steamid": "76561198199056681", "num_games_owned": 48, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 87, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481092788}, "language": "english", "review": "Dull roguelike, not worth more than a couple of bucks.", "timestamp_created": 1481409276, "timestamp_updated": 1481409276, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.331020", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28291362": {"recommendationid": "28291362", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987103121", "num_games_owned": 408, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 2286, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496293746}, "language": "english", "review": "Can't say I ever was on the Rogue game bandwagon back in the day, so my opinion isn't influenced by nostlagia and characters being represented by @ so much in this genre.

Heroes of high enough level drop theyr weapon that becomes fairly powerful if you can retrieve it with next character, also killing champions monsters gives you proofs of stremf that you can cash in for increased stats that future characters can also use. Powerful set items or heirlooms from previous characters can also stored in a bank for future characters.\n\nOnly downside i can think of is that the early game tends become boring chore if you die a lot. Having each character be more powerfu lthan previous because of proofs of stremf makes the early game on each character quite boring until you get back to the challenging stuff.

If the game would have been more polished I would recommend it. As is, I can't.\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]The progression system is great. Every play-through will earn you points that improve your next play-through.\n[*]When the going gets tough and you try to flee and have a near-death experience, the game is at its best.\n[*]The in-game (dungeon) map is great.\n[*]The levels are also a good size. Not too small and not too large (my opinion).\n[*]There is a fairly good variety of types of dungeons.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]There is no proper manual. I've literally had to ask half a dozen questions on the forums to try and figure out how things work. The wiki is also completely useless. Even the most basic things are hidden and have to be guessed.\n[*]One-shot kills. Sometimes you encounter an enemy that one-shot kills you. Out of the blue. Hours of working on a character arbitrarily gone in 1 second. This has forced me to write a script to do save scumming to circumvent this totally unfair game mechanic.\n[*]One of the most important things in a loot game is item comparison. It is downright terrible here. There is no way to quickly compare items other then taking out a calculator and doing the math yourself.\n[*]The inventory system is very poor. There is no way to sort items. Also, different types of weapons and armor you can't even wear aren't separated. This makes sorting out a long list of loot needlessly time-consuming.\n[*]The world overview map is incredibly bad. It's a jumbled mess with random numbers and a POI list going off screen! It is completely unusable.\n[*]The world map itself is also terrible. Dungeons that are cleared partially obscure other dungeons. There is no easy way to see which level a dungeon is (you have to mouse over them one by one which is incredibly tedious). Trivially easy dungeons can be skipped and you get loot for them, but you need to click them one by one and the loot flies everywhere. This gets incredibly tedious when you need to clear 20 or 30 trivial dungeons at a time. Also, the loot is invisible because it is behind the dungeon icon.\n[*]There are many bugs and random crashes. Luckily, the game saves often so you generally don't lose too much progress.\n[*]Very laggy. Especially when you have a couple of summoned skeletons.\n[*]No real AI, all enemies walk straight towards you.\n[*]Poor path-finding (sometimes it literally doesn't work).\n[*]Navigation is annoying because of diagonal movement. I use the cursor keys to move and use the mouse to move diagonally. I generally just take some extra hits so I don't need to reach for the mouse to move diagonally. It totally takes the pacing out of the game. You can set keys for diagonal movement, but I find that very unwieldy.\n[*]The bonuses are incredibly obtuse. They are of the form \"Sometimes causes <effect>\". How much is that? 1%? 10%? Completely useless for determining whether it's a useful effect or not.\n[/list]", "timestamp_created": 1470779710, "timestamp_updated": 1470779726, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.585280", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24619746": {"recommendationid": "24619746", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045471794", "num_games_owned": 160, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 21033, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496534241}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm not much of a reviewer.

On top of all your normal roguelike tropes (permadeath, random dungeons, piles of gear, hordes of enemies to kill) Dungeonmans is built upon a number of pillars that make it an absolute joy to play.\n\n[h1]Constant Progression (!! Optional !!)[/h1]\nThis is something that could turn off someone looking for a more hardcore roguelike were it not [b]entirely optional[/b]. When you first create an academy you have the option of instead making an Ironman Academy that forces you to start completely fresh with each character in that world.\n\nIf you elect not to play with an Ironman Academy, each dungeonman you throw out into the world will help to slowly build up your academy so that it grants bonuses to newly trained dungeonmans. These bonuses primarily come through proofs of stremf which allow you to increase your ability scores, but you also gain the ability to auto-identify potions and scrolls, and gain some (random) bonus skills on new characters.\n\n[h1]Character Customization[/h1]\nThere are no set classes in Dungeonmans. Instead you have a variety of different trees that you can pick and choose from to build your own character that plays how you want it to. Each tree encourages vastly different playstyles than others and mixing and matching abilities from all of these trees allows you to build some truly interesting characters. There are also a number of hidden trees that you unlock by learning certain groups of skills.\n\nThe level cap of 16 gives you a fair number of choices to work with (each class tree possesses 9 skills) and, if you choose to play a Dungeonmans instead of one of the preset skill allocations, you get five bonus points to spend on abilities which brings the total up to 21.  Not only do you have many different options to choose from but, for the most part, they're very well balanced. I can't think of any specific ability that I would call useless and since skills don't have ranks, you never have to worry about whether spending a skill point to get a +X% bonus is actually worth it.\n\nOh, and you can find books that grant you skills that you might not otherwise have. They are fairly rare, though.\n\n[h1]The World[/h1]\nOnce you've chosen the type of academy you wish to create (see Constant Progression below) the overworld is procedurally generated and, once generated, it remains static between characters. On the overworld is your academy, a number of towns, and many dungeons to explore.\n\nTowns serve as hubs to sell your loot and purchase consumables or possibly equipment upgrades. You can also upgrade towns with items that you find in certain types of overworld encounters. Doing so increases the quality of goods that they have for sale. These town improvements carry over between characters and if you max out a town's \"prosperity\" they build a statue of the character that helped them out so selflessly.\n\nThere are a handful of different types of dungeons in Dungeonmans. You have your typical dungeons, as well as towers, temples, graveyards, and possibly a few types beyond that which I haven't encountered yet. Towers, temples, and graveyards are all unique in that they have their own way of going about the dungeon crawl. In towers you're going up a spiral layout to face off against a powerful tower guardian in a one-on-one bout. Temples see you puzzling out how to open their gate (hint: it involves violence) before working down into their depths to defeat the temple master in a grueling trap-filled arena. Finally, graveyards see you fighting through hordes of undead to plunder a tomb filled with horrible undead monstrosities that are all to happy to add you to their numbers.\n\nThere is also a semi-secret post-game dungeon that lets you play indefinitely should you so desire.\n\n[h1]Combat[/h1]\nCombat in Dungeonmans is much faster paced than in most roguelikes and this can certainly be offsetting to those expecting a game where you have to constantly plan out what you're doing every turn. There's actually an entire skill tree based around playing recklessly that rewards you for not taking time to think between mowing through your enemies. To emphasize this, the majority of enemies that you face will fall easily to even your basic attacks. You will quickly learn that not paying attention, however, often ends up with your dungeonman getting a rather permanent case of death. Champion enemies will pose a threat to those who play recklessly and their telltale glow should always see you stopping to take a minute to assess the threat they pose.\n\nIn addition to champions there are also the various bosses you'll face at the end of dungeons. As far as I'm aware, dungeon bosses are simply more dangerous versions of the champions you'd otherwise be facing. This [i]does not[/i] exctend to the bosses of towers and temples. Tower and temple bosses are bad news and will wipe the floor with you if you go in expecting to simply smack them in the faces until they die.\n\nGenerally speaking, so long as you're in an area of appropriate difficulty, you don't have to worry about being surprise one-shot. There are a few situations when it [i]can[/i] happen, though, notably when opening secret doors (let's just say that some secret doors were made to keep things [i]in[/i]). Even situations where you face overwhelming enemy forces can be escaped from so long as you hold onto resources that let you quickly escape from combat situations. Do your best to always have at least a scroll or two of combat blinking on hand at all times!\n\n[h1]Loot![/h1]\nDungeonmans takes an almost action-RPG route with how it doles out loot. Each item type is present in several tiers, with each tier being more powerful than the last. On top of that, items can be randomly rolled with affixes that add various modifiers to them. Like in an action-RPG you have your common items that don't have any magical properties, you have magical items that have a few properties, you have rare items that have many properties, and then you have artifacts that have a few unique properties that can't be found anywhere else.\n\nIn addition to finding loads of magical items, you can also make your own (or further buff the ones you have)! In your travels you will find magical scrolls that enable you to layer additional special properties onto equipment that you find. There are limits to how much magic an item can hold, but by the time you reach them you'll have some incredibly potent gear.\n\nIf you're looking for a very particular modifier on an item, you can mill down items at your academy and use the resulting resources to craft magical hammers that allow you to apply specific affixes to equipment.\n\n[h1]No Auto-Explore[/h1]\nThis is something that I consider a non-issue and is really only here because it's something I've seen the roguelike community bash the game for. You actually have to press keys to explore dungeons in Dungeonmans, the game won't do it for you.

The academy is a potion shop, library, blacksmith and a few other pieces that really make the gameplay fun. There are also towns along the way that you can help to upgrade their wares with prestige chests found in the game.\n\nThe turn based combat fits very well with this game as it allows you to actually strategize your moves when surrounded or in a bad situation, you make a selection of move and the enemies react all together and it continues one move at a time until it\u2019s over.\n\nThe only thing really unsure of but has grown on me was the controls in the game, as it is best played with Keyboard or controller only, this was hard for a KBD/Mouse veteran like myself but the keyboard functions are all mappable and they work well.\n\nI can\u2019t say enough about this little gem of a game and there is no better time to get it then now during a Steam sale but it is definitely worth every penny at normal cost, will provide hours and days of fun....\n", "timestamp_created": 1467213275, "timestamp_updated": 1467213275, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.549922", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23902855": {"recommendationid": "23902855", "author": {"steamid": "76561198151243191", "num_games_owned": 47, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 4266, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508522222}, "language": "german", "review": "Mega gutes Spiel spiel macht echt spa\u00df und kann man sich eingentlich immer geben", "timestamp_created": 1467141577, "timestamp_updated": 1467141577, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23713649": {"recommendationid": "23713649", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044775200", "num_games_owned": 139, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 414, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484779394}, "language": "english", "review": "Excellent game, thoroughly enjoyable.", "timestamp_created": 1466628586, "timestamp_updated": 1466628586, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.456169", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23622110": {"recommendationid": "23622110", "author": {"steamid": "76561198203650748", "num_games_owned": 49, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 3170, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505067947}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u80fd\u4e0d\u80fd\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a \u4e2d\u6587\u8865\u4e01\uff0c\u6211\u4e00\u5f00\u59cb\u73a9\u7684\u662f\u76d7\u7248\uff0c\u5c31\u662f\u56e0\u4e3a\u662f\u6c49\u5316\u7248\u672c\uff0c\u4e2d\u56fd\u4eba\u4e0d\u662f\u8bf4\u4e00\u5b9a\u73a9\u76d7\u7248\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u770b\u4e0d\u61c2\u82f1\u6587\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\u5f88\u6709\u610f\u601d\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u5b9e\u5728\u770b\u4e0d\u61c2\u82f1\u6587\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1466202607, "timestamp_updated": 1466202607, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511064", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23498222": {"recommendationid": "23498222", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054325039", "num_games_owned": 55, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 7688, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504495099}, "language": "english", "review": "Most enjoyable rogue I've ever played.

When suddenly I got an error the game stopped (closed) and popped a window the so called crash report which says if you have any bugs explain them leave email and we will contact you or something very similar to that. \nAt first I didn\u2019t care too much. What\u2019s the worst your level 13 + is dead? Although he was not in any danger. Yeah that would be bad but not bad as this. I tried to load my save (city ) it says load my lvl 13 dungeonman (The 1st floor of the Villains of grimsly trail) around x5 times+ I got crash! The same window appeared with crash report and there\u2019s nothing you can do about it. I tried searching internet to try and find a fix it, I even posted in dungeonman steam bug discussion this problem, and you can find it at page 55 if someone is interested. But no luck I did not get an answer on how to fix this game (save). Don\u2019t get me wrong I did send my problem in the crash report with email 4 or more times. Once every week, but developer did not contact me.\nI can start a new city but what is the point? To play and farm some good gear and maybe again get this problem. That\u2019s not fun, If any game (fighting, RPG, rouge like, driving, simulator etc. had this problem I would not recommend it!) \nThis game has smaller much smaller bugs (problems), but many people continue playing this game because they didn\u2019t experience this problem. Or maybe they didn\u2019t get Salty as me.\nIf I didn\u2019t experience this bug (problem ignoring from developer or his team I would have posted amazingly good review and would recommend to play this game. I mean what\u2019s the point of the crash report, forum etc if you will not try and help people to solve something like this. More than 4 months passed did I get an answer on how to fix this bug?

Combat is fun.  Dungeon crawling is good, with a nice variety of different dungeon types.  Proceedural generation of dungeons works pretty well and there is a decent selection of monsters (though I would like to see more).\n\nI'm giving this a reluctant thumbs up though.  For me, the \"unique selling proposition\" of this game was the proceedurally generated overworld.  This is what Dungeonmans offered that other rogue likes do not.  Unfortunately, there really is nothing to the overworld.\n\nYes it generates various terrain, roads, towns, and dungeons--but none of this really matters.  Since there are no food or supply requirements, you don't have to worry about distance or travel times.  It makes no difference whether you are traveling through a forest, field, or road--it has no impact on the game.  Well, on very rare occassions you will have a random encounter in the overworld--and where you are will determine the terrain of the battle field, but these encounters are very rare, and you almost always have a choice to avoid the encounter anyway.\n\nIt doesn't matter how far away you are from the Dungeonmans Academy--if you need to go back, there is nothing stopping you--no time considerations, no supply worries, no real threat from the inhabitants--BUT, there is one obstacle, and that is the tedium of walking your icon all the way across the map to turn in some artifacts and id magic items.\n\nBasically what the overhead map amounts to is a very cumbersome and clunky menu where you select which dungeon or town you want to enter.  Unfortunately, instead of just selecting the dungeon with mouse and cursor, your cursor is your Dungeonman and you have to walk it slowly across the menu that looks like a map to select the dungeon you want to enter. \n\nIn short, there is almost zero gameplay to the overhead map element of Dungeonmans--its just a very thematic but cumbersome menu.\n\nIve read a number of reviews for this game that say Dungeonmans is fun, but why play it when TOME already exists.  For me the answer would be a proceedurally generated overworld, but Dungeonmans failed on this aspect.\n\nDespite all that, I have had a lot of fun with the game, so i do recommend it.

They can find ways to upgrade their old academy - more books for the school's library, more equipment for the alchemy lab, and most importantly Proof of Stremfs. These things let the battlemaster teach you better stats, and most importantly they mean the next graduates start out with better stats when your current graduate inevitably dies.\n\nBecause yes. It's a roguelike, and you will splat your Fightermans against an enemy with a bigger stick. Or you'll get overconfident, charge into a mob of punks, and die to their fanged pet. Or you'll discover that fighters without stamina can't handle kiting enemy mages. (I should have brought a potion of stamina, or just run away! Picking your fights wisely is the key to leveling up in this game.)\n\nBut with each death, your next Wizardmans or Rangermans or whatevermans will be stronger, better, faster - and they'll conquer the next dungeon, and upgrade the local towns, and become famous! ...Up until they die.\n\nBut that's Dungeonmans.

It\u2019s not perfect, but it\u2019s very well done. Would love to see more content drop on this game, as I have seen little over the course of owning it.  The pros far outweigh the cons, and don\u2019t kill the satisfaction you get from the game.\n\nPros:\n\nHumor is genuinely funny, which I find to be rare in a game. Perhaps not always the safest humor, but it\u2019s definitely to my taste.\n\nCombat is quick and easy to execute with the num pad or mouse which can be both a boon and a curse as the game does require some critical thinking with little room for error in its tightest situations.\n\nPersistence is done well because the game is satisfying even in a losing scenario. Yes the game is not really feasible to beat in 1-2 or 3 play-throughs, but you\u2019re playing a rogue-lite-like-\u201cworst descriptor for a game ever\u201d. You\u2019re playing a difficult game with perma-death streamlined for quick play\u2026 how about that. Why do you need to feel like its fair right from the get go? Because you thought you were King The-best-at-games? If you can get past your own hubris, then playing each run to the best of your ability and feeling like you took home a doggy bag of treats for the next run feels far better in a game that was designed to be played more than once through. Sure you can just hump through the game like an idiot and probably accrue enough power to steamroll as well, but to each their own. This game allows you to get out of it what you put in.\n\nGoing to jump back on persistence here, because this is really what the hook is on this game. Having famous bosses and dungeons that killed your characters grow in fame is pretty satisfying. Going to a boss that killed 2 or 3 of your characters feels like there is cross play-through narrative and gives some context to a pretty random world. Statues in towns you upgraded with champions throws some history into the mix. Overall I would say this does an even better job at rewarding persistence than the Dungeonmans HQ even does.\n\nCons:\n\nHeavy reliance on character displacement as the key to difficulty, which can create some frustrating deaths.  There are definitely ways around this, I simply wish it wasn\u2019t so heavily relied on is all.  It\u2019s the single most necessary to mitigate creature ability, which exacerbates the next con on the list.\n\nCharacter development skill trees could have been a bit more diverse. There are a lot of skills, but maybe not as many as there should be designed around certain characters archetypes. It\u2019s a bit like the game is more designed around armor and weapon as an archetype than skillsets as an archetype. You\u2019ll probably grab wizard skills as a warrior. Hell you will probably be a wizard and necromancer. But the question is really will you use light, medium or heavy armor or dual wield, sword and board, staff, bow or lance. I know that sounds nit-picky given that that\u2019s a huge number of combinations with just those two variables, but I would have liked more non-equipment based paths to travel.\n\nYour base of operations progression is pretty vanilla. It would have been nice to see more varied artifacts being brought in to the mix with more variety in bonuses across play-throughs through the HQ. I know it\u2019s not a management game, but accruing marks of Stremf and storing the odd piece of equipment does feel a little lack luster. Less of a con and more of a missed opportunity.\n\nRNG doesn\u2019t bring a huge amount to the table here other than dungeon layout, and even that isn\u2019t really noticeable. There aren\u2019t a huge amount of unique objects that you feel special seeing that aren\u2019t equipment based. It facilitates replay, but doesn\u2019t enhance it. Rarely do I feel RNG is implemented well, though, so I suppose take this with a grain of salt. I believe RNG should be used to add to narrative, and in this case the persistence takes its place effectively. Again, less of a con and more of a missed opportunity.", "timestamp_created": 1445958201, "timestamp_updated": 1445958232, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.449328", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18592246": {"recommendationid": "18592246", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025185275", "num_games_owned": 793, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 5339, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501281608}, "language": "english", "review": "Once you get all the achievements, you pretty much have to write a review, am I right? I mean, I want to be a good mans to the developer, who totally rocked it with this one.\n\nAnyway, Dungeonmans is a great roguelike with a good sense of humor that I found quite charming. The name of the game is used as a point of humor throughout, so basically any phrase that would end in \"man\" or \"men\" becomes \"mans\" instead [spoiler](Mans-at-Arms, Lizardmans, Necromanser, Lady Dungeonmans, etc). Also on the subject of humor, one of the pictures on the store page shows the \"Beeholder\" enemy, which fights like a D&D Beholder but spawns bee-type enemies to fight you when it dies.[/spoiler]\n\nIf there's one thing I can't stop thinking about this game, it's that it feels like a really well-designed experience. Some people may say it feels simplified, but this is definitely a \"less is more\" type of thing. I've played ToME and DCSS, and those are fun, but this game has a much tighter scope in my opinion. The graphics certainly don't hurt, either.\n\nIt's got a good system of turn-based movement and combat, pretty standard stuff in that regard. I felt like there was a good mix of single-target and AOE abilities that kept me using different skills almost constantly. A lot of games in this genre can fall apart once you find that one ability that trumps everything.\n\nAlso, it's fairly reasonable to think that if you play your mans well, you'll get at least decent gear and be able to really kick some butt. In all the hours I played, I never once felt like I got screwed because I needed a new weapon that just wouldn't drop, or had an enemy show up that my character wasn't at least capable of dealing with [spoiler](I know, I shouldn't have gotten arrogant and bump-fought that scrolled monster party...)[/spoiler]\n\nFor anyone put off by the mechanic where you can pass along boosts to later generations (it actually can get extremely overpowered if you plan ahead), I would like to state that there's an achievement for clearing the game with a single mans, so that's a good challenge for those looking for the traditional roguelike one-life-to-live experience. That was my first clear of the game, which is probably why I had so many hours logged before it happened.\n\n[h1]TL;DR:[/h1]\n\n[b]Buy this game, it's super fun.

Despite the breadth of the rogue-like/rogue-lite genres and the sheer variety of games and game mechanics contained in those terms, Dungeonmans is among my favorites. But to understand why I love this game, you first have to understand what it is not.\n\n[list]\n    [*]Dungeonmans is not a story-based experience in the slightest. If that's what you want, look elsewhere.\n    [*]Dungeonmans is not the sort of rogue-like where starvation is a constant threat--there is no hunger mechanic whatsoever.\n    [*]Dungeonmans is not a rogue-lite. You will not find the twin stick shooter chaos of Binding of Isaac. You will not find the platforming of Spelunky. You will not find the music-based gameplay of Crypt of the Necrodancer. You will not find the castlevania stylings of Rogue Legacy. All of those games are good, but they are not what you will find in Dungeonmans.\n[/list]\n\nWhat you WILL find in Dungeonmans:\n[list]\n    [*]A skill system that rewards patience and emphasizes maneuvering above all else.\n    [*]Several classes, from the conventional warrior/mage/archer archetypes to the less common like polearm specialists who can create area of effect zones to bolster their power/debuff their enemies and berserkers with a penchant for dressing with class and drinking tea. \n    [*]The ability to ignore the preset classes and tinker with hybrid builds as you see fit. Wizard/necromancer? Done. Archer with plate armor? Fair enough. Some dude who picks and chooses from several classes at once and potentially sucks at all of them? Rather likely in the short term while you figure things out.\n    [*] Dungeons to delve and monsters to slay, from slimes and evil wizards to pseudo-British bomb throwing anarchists.\n    [*]A system of progression that allows you to build off the successes of previous characters through things like auto-identified potions and scrolls, better starting gear, or more stats to go around. Or, if you feel like it, none of that at all.\n    [*]An overworld map teeming with dungeons to explore, towns to sell excess loot, and occasional bandit camps.\n    [*]The roguelike staple of potentially cursed gear.\n    [*]Hidden shops staffed entirely by talking bees.\n[/list]\n\nIt's not a perfect game, as no such game exists. The progression system inevitably bothers rogue-like purists, even though it can be almost entirely ignored or opted-out of. The game's sense of humor can and does rub some people the wrong way. The flexibility of the skill system can leave some players lost, or others annoyed that it isn't as complicated as say, Tales of Maj Eyal. Yet looked at strictly on its own merits, Dungeonmans is what many rogue-likes strive to be: a rewarding adventure where the risk of death comes primarily from player carelessness, where mechanics are simple enough to learn but deep enough to experiment with, and there are always more foes lying in wait to slay.

I believe that this will give you a greater appreciation for the genre and for the gem that this game truly is.

almost give this game a thumbs up.  It has a lot going for it.  It has some dynamic classes you can make, and I like the persistence of the academy where you can get previous hero's gear, id potions and scrolls and a few other things.  I also like the open nature of the world and the fact that you can customize your gear with enchants and stuff.\n\nHowever, there is something that really pisses me off about this game and I consider terrible game design.  I had several good runs just end because of total BS bosses.  Really, the final one took the cake and just was beyond stupd and made me not want to play this game anymore.\n\nAnyway, in general it goes something like this.\n1.  Open a door.\n2. Die\n\nOr\n1. Open door and enter room.\n2.  See some odd effect on a boss and wonder what it does.\n3. Die.\n\nWhen you are in a dungeon where most of the monsters, including champions don't even touch you, that the boss, while challenging, should not one shot you or wipe the floor with you as you desperatly get away.  Unless you are stupid, you should not die like this.   There is an escape scroll you can use, but it takes 20 rounds to activate. Plenty of time to die some of these BS bosses.\n\nNow let me tell you about the last, total BS boss.  It was not even a dungeon boss, just opened a door and there he was.  I guess that makes him a champion and not a boss (even worse).\n\nThe first thing this boss does is steal my weapon.  This has never happened before.  I rummnage around my backpack and get another weapon and equip it.  While I do this, he steals my armor.  Again, this is beyond stupid.  I also have a pet called a hateglacier which is fairly tough.  He 2 shots the pet.  I had close to 400 hp, and he drops me to 60 pts in one hit.  I teleport away (after having lost my really good armor and weapon to this guy).  I do through a scroll.  BTW when he hit me, not only did he do a tun of damage, but he took away nearly all my stamina too.  Then I try and run away, but he is really fast.  I am sucking down potions and teleporting, buring all my consumables. It is no use.  Game over.\n\nI spent like 6 hours on this character and that kind of end just doesn't sit well to me.  Difficulty should ramp up and scale somewhat evenly. It should not spike like a 1000 foot vertical wall.\n\nAll and all this game is somewhat repetitive (after having like 10 characters I was really bored of the first part of the game) and clearly needs some major balance.  If you are in a dungeon and you are fairly \"safe\" from even the occasional champion, you should not open doors to things like this.  Also stealing equipped items is just stupid (although, if he did not steal those items, I am sure he would have wiped the floor with me anyway).", "timestamp_created": 1440359264, "timestamp_updated": 1440359264, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.587449", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17571518": {"recommendationid": "17571518", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020822205", "num_games_owned": 688, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 31170, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 10, "last_played": 1513901566}, "language": "english", "review": "This game has made me really, really happy.", "timestamp_created": 1439751605, "timestamp_updated": 1439751605, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17541122": {"recommendationid": "17541122", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003280882", "num_games_owned": 592, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 144, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1439410849}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game lots of fun keep coming back to it will be doing a lot more videos\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlYc0Q_RSPA", "timestamp_created": 1439587248, "timestamp_updated": 1439587317, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.468905", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17481990": {"recommendationid": "17481990", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970759912", "num_games_owned": 199, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 2666, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487549749}, "language": "english", "review": "I really want to recomend this game. \n\nBut its got no balance, most of the descriptions are lies, and nothing works as intended.

It's really not a well-designed rogue-lite.\n\nSo, what is dungeonmans? It's a rogue(lite) game in which you pick a character, customize some of it's stats and perks, select a class (optional) and off you go to slay random monsters around the randomly generated world. Or die horribly.\n\nWhat is different from most roguelike games is,  that unlike most roguelikes where after you die you roll a completely fresh character, is that you can eventually upgrade your starting characters with various perks by bringing back various items to the starting zone: base stats, better starting gear, you can even unlock entire skill trees from the get-go.\n\nHowever, this is where the core issue lies. The game balance is designed with this in mind. You will need to essentially farm stats for your future character to succeed. Otherwise you will literally get one shoted by higher tier monsters. And there is no way of working around it. The hordes of enemies and the lack of complex spells and abilities waters down the gameplay to \"grind stats, die, start another characters, repeat\" until you EVENTUALLY get strong enough to walk over everyone' faces.\n\nThe \"randomly generated\" dungeons are very repetitive with no interesting objects to interact with. The loot is tiered, meaning as soon as you get an item from a higher tier the other ones become obsolete. The skill \"trees\" are a sad joke.\n\nOverall, not a good game, not even as a \"babbys first roguelike\".", "timestamp_created": 1437520338, "timestamp_updated": 1437520338, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 68, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.553039", "comment_count": "6", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17017824": {"recommendationid": "17017824", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014902234", "num_games_owned": 414, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 442, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1436998845}, "language": "english", "review": "\"Nothing quite like a weekend of... getting killed over and over again.\"\n\nI don't know whether this is old school or not but this is dificult.\n\nOK late at night so I'll give my first impressions later, however I've gone blue for a reason.", "timestamp_created": 1436739408, "timestamp_updated": 1436739408, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16946295": {"recommendationid": "16946295", "author": {"steamid": "76561197981259425", "num_games_owned": 692, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 687, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1446731083}, "language": "english", "review": "I am now Dungeonmans, thanks to Dungeonmans Academy, and you can be too.\n\nSerious Review:\nDungeonmans is tons of fun. It's the kind of game that looks at the concept of an inventory limit and scoffs. There are always more zones to clear, more loot to find, more artifacts to find. In addition, the NPC towns you encounter live and die by your success or failure. The death of a Hero causes all the towns to lose a stat called Prosperity (exactly what it says on the tin), but you can bolster a town's Prosperity by donating a \"Purloined Inventory\" or 3. You get those from being a Dungeonmans and killing named/champion enemies. \n\nThey also drop artifacts, which I mentioned earlier. You can turn those in back at the Academy, but here's the catch: your current run will not benefit from this in any way.

Period.\nIt's a fun permadeath game, I've been playing it non-stop and I've been slowly losing my mind because it takes a lot of dying to learn what to do in certain situations. I'm too lazy to think of  a list of pros and cons so I'm just going to describe my experience.\n\nMy first Dungeonmans was an Archer, not a very versatile class to begin with but easy to use. Anytime I'd get stuck in a corner I'd just hop over one of the enemies and fire an arrow into there skull as I flew over. It was going smoothly, I started getting confident and that was my downfall, started running through dungeons, was working well for me until I walked into a room with a mage and a Pangolin Champion. The mage set me on fire and pushed me around, and the pangolin kept juggling me from one side of the room to the other. The archer relies on evasion, but you learn later on that it's a poor choice when you start meeting the new enemies.\n\nNext dungeonmans was a Wizard. If you want to play wizard, make sure to activate light shield whenever you get into a fight with enemies at your level or higher, the wizard can be a real tank if used right. Anyways, go to a dungeon, usual enemies, then again, new enemies. Cryomansers and Necromansers, get frozen, get poisened to death by a deathly fog because my light shield wore off.\n\nBannerman was next, who is so far my favorite class other than Necromanser. Both mentioned classes are highly versatile, Necromanser even more so. My bannerman was my strongest dungeonman of all, but died when I encountered my first Tower at level Nine. It was a breeze, all the Necromansers kinda pissed me off with the toxic clouds but Fervor helps a lot. Get to the top, and now I'm in what seems to be my first real boss fight.

I had already been a kickstarter backer when you ran the article, but really didnt have too high of hopes for the game. I was on a kickstarter binge for a while there, and dungeonmans was kind of my long shot. \n\nIn the time since you ran that article, dungeonmans has released, along with a few of my other kickstarter backed games (at least EA builds). \n\nThese games include:\nMassive Chalice\nRoad Redemption\nWasteland 2\nShovel Knight\nDreamfall Chapters\nElite Dangerous\nGodus (bleh)\nStar Citizen\n\nI have spent far more hours in Dungeonmans, than any of those other games. Not saying I dont like the others, they are all (for the most part) great, but Dungeonmans is up there with Spelunky for me in the roguelike genre. It is currently my 9th most played game on Steam with a library of around 300 games. Obliviously most of those dont get much play time at all, but I do game every day (95% Counter Strike), and Dungeonmans keeps drawing me back, especially when I'm in game downtime (waiting for a team). \n\nMy whole point in all of this is that it would be really cool for you guys to run a review on this game sometime. I think its fully released now, its been quite polished for some time. \n\nIt kind of makes me sad that this game didnt make a top chart once, I keep looking for it to gain some love, but I just havent seen much press on it. Get one of your rogulike lovers on it, I would be surprised if they didnt like it. Seriously, the game is like crack. \n\nI bought it for my friend who is also my main CS teammate, we talk dungeonmans builds all the time. I honestly havent even beat it yet, I'm not sure I've even gotten close. \n\nAnyway, I probably sound like I work for dungeonmans at this point (I dont, as far as I know its made by a single person, maybe two), I honestly just feel like gamers need to play this one. Its truly a hidden gem.\n\nThanks for your time\n\n________________________________________________________________________________\n\nSo yes, Thumbs up\n", "timestamp_created": 1429173383, "timestamp_updated": 1429173383, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 51, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.694986", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15177672": {"recommendationid": "15177672", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008534531", "num_games_owned": 301, "num_reviews": 56, "playtime_forever": 1869, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503559478}, "language": "english", "review": "two large medium pizzasmans", "timestamp_created": 1428020545, "timestamp_updated": 1428020545, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.478831", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15105361": {"recommendationid": "15105361", "author": {"steamid": "76561198100934692", "num_games_owned": 392, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 3248, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468833035}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u662f\u4e00\u6b3e\u4e0d\u9519\u7684\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u5c31\u662f\u73a9\u7684\u65f6\u5019\u6709\u4e00\u70b9\u8650\u3002\u3002\u7ecf\u5e38\u6253\u4e86\u51e0\u4e2a\u5c0f\u65f6\u4e00\u8eab\u795e\u88c5\u7ed3\u679c\u88ab\u67d0\u4e2a\u89d2\u843d\u91cc\u7684\u5c0f\u602a\u7ed9\u79d2\u4e86\u3002\u3002\n\n\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u6e38\u620f\u4f53\u9a8c\u611f\u4e0d\u9519\uff0c\u559c\u6b22\u5730\u7262\u7684\u670b\u53cb\u53ef\u4ee5\u5165\u4e00\u53d1\uff01\u6b22\u8fce\u4ea4\u6d41\u9634\u6c9f\u7ffb\u8239\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\uff01\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1427617828, "timestamp_updated": 1427617828, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.433290", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15029974": {"recommendationid": "15029974", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987130556", "num_games_owned": 114, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 6482, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486802225}, "language": "english", "review": "Addictive little dungeon crawler with a little bit more.

I was impressed when banners showed their new effects in tooltips when leveled up, but disappointed to find upgrading light armour didn't do the same.\nThe game keeps things interesting using lots of active abilities on the player but also monsters. However sometimes the list of actives to try to set up, as well as potions to quaff, can sometimes seem overwhelming, one character had 4 abilities to buff themselves up but focusing on that leaves no time to move or attack- and so I found myself focusing on the other 2 abilities that give enhanced mobility and attacks in one. Some longer, cheaper buffs are optimally constantly active but can be a pain to keep up- especially the light shield power offered by light armour skill as using it before it expires causes it to explode rather than refresh and that explosion puts a cooldown before you can make shields again.\n\nIn the kickstarter version my deaths were domiated by a few types of monsters putting out massive damage who thankfully seem to have been toned down- though the triger seems to want to take their place- and since then I've ran into some very nasty bone barons who create powerful summons as well as being strong on their own. Also unleashing ancient kings by opening secrets can sometimes lead to a quick death- unlike other secrets or exile chest which give you a prompt whether to fight them or not.\n\nWhile the game has no strict classes you still have starter options, and even going for choice with the dungeonmans (as I tend to do) you still stick within skill trees so I'll mention as few things. I enjoyed and was pretty successful on the bannermans, though I'm not convinced using banners for buffs makes all that much of a difference compared to just buffing. Southern gentlemans have a fun theme and interesting gimmick of real time that is very flavourful for a berserkerish character but I don't think being encouraged to play quick and sloppy is that good a gimmick, and their skills seem random in a way you seem to need to react to, certainly not good for a character that encourages button mashing. Playing some other characters i found myself relying on archery powers even on characters that started melee focused and wonder if the ability to kite melee enemies and not be kited by ranged ones makes ranged characters too good compared to melee. I did still manage to have a lot of success on a sword and board, so it isn't needed. I seem to remember necromansers used to be very mage related but now aren't, which is nice for options but does leave necromancers (and southern gentlemen) without and clear idea or real synergies with any weapons set up, especially as the game doesn't really say what stats their skills benefit from.\n\nOne major feature, but unfortunately one I'm not a massive fan off, is the idea of a persistant academy you build up. It lets you make characters brokenly skilled, statted and equipped in the early game, but still doesn't really let you skip the early levels. There is also a lot of randomness, or sticking to what successful previous characters have done, that can make the usefulness vary massively between different characters. As strong as characters can be early later on is still a challenge, which is obviously somewhat good, but also means very successful early characters can easily find themselves underpowered. Really not a thing I am sure about, but hasn't been deal breaking and there are neat elements like avenging dungeonmans and aquiring some of their equipment, or gathering information on enemies.", "timestamp_created": 1427063745, "timestamp_updated": 1427405285, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14814920": {"recommendationid": "14814920", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039884114", "num_games_owned": 127, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 1920, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462734455}, "language": "spanish", "review": "El otro d\u00eda tuve una discusi\u00f3n trascendental, de esas que te marcan el camino a seguir en la vida.\n\nA un lado del ring, mi parte del cerebro racional y calculadora, la que quiere que todos y cada uno de mis minutos de videojuegos tengan recompensa y progresi\u00f3n.\n\nEnfrente, mi parte del cerebro a la que le va la \"salsa\", esa que me hace adorar los juegos con Permadeath.\n\nTodo comenzo con una pregunta, \u00bfPor  qu\u00e9 lo sigues haciendo, por qu\u00e9 malgastas horas de vicio y progresi\u00f3n con juegos/modos que se cargan por completo tu personaje al morir?\n\nReconozco que la pregunta tiene su chicha, que muchas veces provoca que nuestra parte m\u00e1s Hardcore se pare unos segundos a pensar en un \"sentido filos\u00f3fico\" a semejante locura.

El RNG, como olvidarnos de \u00e9l, por un lado, esta ah\u00ed para hacer que las localizaciones del mapamundi y la disposici\u00f3n de las mazmorras vayan cambiando con cada partida, para intentar que cada una tenga su toque \"distinto\", por otro lado est\u00e1 ah\u00ed para hacer que partidas que parezcan un paseo, se conviertan en un infierno por la aparici\u00f3n de determinados grupos de enemigos/campeones, en los momentos menos deseables. O lo amas, o lo odias, pero es raro que el RNG vaya a dejar indiferente a nadie en un juego del estilo.\n\nE. Las clases, o mejor dicho perks, tenemos un juego en que empezaremos eligiendo una clase, que nos dar\u00e1 una serie de habilidades iniciales, sin embargo, en este juego nada te impide aprender una habilidad de otra clase (siempre y cuando cumplas ciertos requisitos), en definitiva, a diferencia de otros juegos en los que eres una clase desde que naces hasta que mueres, aqu\u00ed puedes mezclar habilidades a cascoporro hasta que des con algo que te pueda gustar ( si vives lo suficiente claro).\n\nF.

I had to edit this review, however. It was even better than I imagined.\n\nThe game starts out as a fun roguelike and it is immediately endearing. The static character sprites become of little concern with all the wonderful animated effects and amazing soundtrack. It seems initially like a well-done roguelike with some cool mechanics involved. I won't get into those mechanics because it would be too hard to explain them without ranting about how cool they are.\n\nShortly after grasping the game and being on your way in a fun roguelike, you become somewhat awed by how well the game plays and how neat the Academy building, nemesis system, soul-retrieving mechanics work. Then, once that shock starts to wear off, you'll notice the many dungeon themes, each with a whole set of mobs to go with the theme, and you'll start finding new themes. It's like a whole world of oldschool Dungeons and Dragons that's just thrown down for you to explore. Towns to bolster the prosperity of, bandit blockades to raid, Scrobold warrens, crypts, mage towers, it's all here.\n\nNow, there's a few key points that I noticed.\n\nNo worrying about food or inventory limit. That's right, no worries on that. This irked me slightly at the outset, but I rationalized that inventory limits cause you to have to do a lot of backtracking and it gets boring tedious, not fun tedious. And there's a TON of loot to nab! So, removing the inventory limit was a smart move for this game. Well,  with no inventory limit, then hunger becomes pointless as it won't be long before you can just shove a ton of rations in your pack and forget about hunger for a while. It might sound odd to oldschool roguelike players, but the ramoval of the hunger and inventory limit are actually very good for this game and it really works.\n\nThe loot system, while there's just a ton of stuff you're picking up, makes it very easy to manage the stuff you're actually interested in looking at as well as super easy to offload the stuff you don't want, through the clever use of tabs and sell/smelt selections when talking to shopkeeps/smiths.\n\nThe game also has a lot of really cool psuedo-hidden \"secrets\". Every town is worth exploring. At lower levels, it's easy to ignore towns and, indeed, ignore many of your consumables (not to say lower levels are easy, trust me), but as you start fighting higher level enemies, you start paying a lot more attention to what you're using and how you're using it and you start wishing you'd bought all those scrolls of combat blinking and pin to win, but you didn't need them back then. You'd better grab them up with the next character!\n\nThe combat itself defeats traditional roguelike standards in every way. The skills are all unique and build awesome characters and force you to truly pay attention to what spaces you're moving to. A fightermans doesn't just bump up against a mob until it dies - you have a number of special moves and you'd better make good use of them! What's more, you can customize your characters move sets and pick new skills from any class as you level. The classes are more like archetypes, really, just to give you a start, but you can choose a custom class as well.\n\nThere's a resource building mechanic so that future characters will be more successful, but you can opt to build up those resources and still not use them in the spirit of traditional roguelikes, but they're there if you want to give yourself an edge - and in such a way that you pick which edges you want and ignore the others.\n\nThere's a legacy system as well, but I won't try to explain it, just know that it's very very cool!\n\nProcedural world, running legacies, themed dungeons - a - many, very tactical combat, tons of items and loot to find, towns to explore, libromancers to irritate, lots of enemies, champions, and named bosses, this game pretty much has it all!\n\nTL;DR I honestly cannot give this game enough praise.

I might end up liking it over ToME because of it's humor, charm and accessibility.  Both are excellent, so if you've played one of the two and like it, the other is a given.\n\nI've spent about 12 hours with it (I play some steam-less so the hours played won't be accurate) and I've gotten quite far, yet I'm still surprised quite often.  I've barely explored the world map, but that's mostly due to my completely self-inflicted deaths.  I'm getting the hang of it now and the fact that you can combine any class skills together in combos makes for excellent versatility, replay and fun.  Right now, I'm playing a heavy-armor wearing ranger / necro hybrid.  It's awesome.\n\nWhile ToME may be rich in story / lore, Dungeonmans makes up for it in charm.  The visuals, sound and music are excellent.  I especially love the over-the-top level up screen and boss defeat animations.  This game also has some persistence; that is, if you provide your starting academy with certain items you get when completing dungeons, you'll get to assign more stat points to your future \"dungeonmans\".  You also find rare skill books, and if you'd rather not use them, donate them to your library and eventually you'll be able to start the game knowing more and more scroll effects.  Provide your armorer with loot that's been molten down and you can start your future dudes with stronger armor, weapons, etc.\n\nYou have your overworld map, which is randomized and contains towns you can visit to buy/sell loot, dungeons, bandit barricades and other stuff.  Random battles rarely occur when you're on this overworld map, and you can skip most but not all.  I personally like them; they're different than your usual dungeon crawling and can have variety of enemies including champions.\n\nWhat's also cool is if you die in a certain dungeon, you can go to that same area / floor with your next guy and collect some XP and possibly a weapon.  It's not game breaking but it surely helps.\n\nMouse and keyboard control work very well, but it would be nice to be able to remap the controls without delving into a text file.  Thankfully, the text file is easy to understand so remapping the entire keyboard can be done in minutes.  The file, along with Dungeonmans's savegames are located in \\users\\*username*\\AppData\\Roaming\\Dungeonmans.  I think the file is keybindings.txt but if it's not, it'll be fairly obvious.\n\nIn conclusion, I'm addicted to this game.  I can already tell it'll become one of my mainstay roguelikes that I can enjoy for years.  To the developer - you should port your game to the PS4 system.  It is sorely lacking in fun roguelikes, and while PC is an excellent platform, your game would be the perfect mix of difficulty, charm and fun for the console community.\n\nWell worth the full $17 I payed.", "timestamp_created": 1424475861, "timestamp_updated": 1424475861, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14548453": {"recommendationid": "14548453", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972483399", "num_games_owned": 666, "num_reviews": 116, "playtime_forever": 7540, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506019809}, "language": "english", "review": "This is another example of a good rogue-like... but it's TOUGH.

So, I'll do that:\n\nFirst off, Dungeonmans is very true to the Rogue-like ideal. It has everything you would expect: Permadeath, turn-based gameplay, loads of unique creatures inhabiting a procedurally generated world, loads of nasty surprises that will make you think \u201cMan... I shouldn't have gone through that portal\u201d, and, of course, tons of unidentified and potentially deadly loot.\n\nThe classic formula is there: Go kill the bad guys, take their loot, get more powerful, go kill more powerful bad guys, take their loot. On top of that there are a number of ways to pass your progress on to your next character (and you need that because you're going to die a lot). Much of your forward progress comes in the form of upgrading the Dungeonmans Academy. You can find a number of artifacts to improve the academy making things easier for new recruits. In addition you can get relics which only \u201cunlock\u201d once the character that discovered them has died. So new characters can enjoy a number of benefits from those that have passed on before.\n\nOf course, your current Dungeonman can also find artifacts that help them. Proofs of Stremf can be used to increase stats immediately, saved to give to future recruits, or both. Equipment can be enhanced using the smithy at the academy or by using magic scrolls you'll find in dungeons or shops. You can make some truly epic level gear. (And that's a good thing, because you're going to need it.)\n\nThe artwork is a beautiful example of old school 2D and it perfectly fits the theme of the game. On top of that Dungeonmans is loaded with humor that has quite literally made me laugh out loud time and time again.\n\nAll things considered the game is hours and hours of fun. I would love to tell you what the end game is like, but I haven't gotten anywhere near it yet. However, I am very confident that the game continues in the same vein. If I ever manage to hack my way to the Dread Purpleonians I'm sure there will be an interesting (and humorous) grand conflict.\n\nSo, the long and short of it is this: Dungeonmans is certainly worth the price of admission!", "timestamp_created": 1420380172, "timestamp_updated": 1420380172, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.999074", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13779499": {"recommendationid": "13779499", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032121748", "num_games_owned": 115, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 453, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1420336425}, "language": "english", "review": "Good old fashioned true roguelike.

Loved it, burned myself out, not gonna touch it for a while. \n\nPros:\n[list]\n[*]Really addictive. When your doomed or careless mans dies, you just want to do better. Immediately. \n[*]It  has humour without being silly (IMO). I did not like the humour in dungeons of dredmor, I love the humour in dungeonmans. \n[*]Academy is a great idea, and provides some progress from game to game, even if a bit overpowered. \n[*]Loved the GUI and 'feel' of the controls. \n[*]Being class-less (no rigid fighter-cleric-wizard stuff) allows many potential combos. Some are more useful than others, so there's a lot of fun (and frustration) in experimentation. \n[*]Loot, monster types, skills, bosses, map types are all varied and good.\n[/list]\n\nCons:\n[list]\n[*]Feels kind of unfinished at times. Stuff are getting fixed, but some glaring ones still remain (shield visuals not transferring from level to level, tiles being wrong at times, loot falling on unreachable places, enemies stacked together, museum monster entries being pointless to name a few)\n[*]Stat stacking from death to death can create some really overpowered characters. After the death of a few lvl 10 chars, you'll have a mean killing machine that can tackle legendary places  with ease. Sounds great at first, becomes boring after a while. My winning player killed the final boss with 3 skill hits. \n[*]Too few set items. In ~50 hours I found parts from only two. Several parts, more than once.\n[*]Some dungeon types are too big. Combined with lack of autoexplore, they become *boring*.\n[*]City functionality is underwhelming. Could do with (a lot of) improvement.\n[*]Dungeon layouts could be better.

A very nice balance between the randomness and challenge of perma-death featured in most roguelikes, yet also with the ability to keep some of your progress for future charecters with the academy system. The tactical turn-based combat is extremely well-done and has a lot to offer.\n\nSome of the negative reviews are hilarious (not that there are many, and for good reason), a guy spent 70 hours on this game and couldn't beat it and left a negative reveiw. Must suck to be so bad. I beat this game in 50 hours and left me hungering for more. That is the sign of a great game. In this game, if you die, it's your own damn fault because it's TURN-BASED, if you run into a powerful monster you can't handle then use a scroll of teleport and gtfo. Also, after about 10 or more charecter deaths, the amount of stuff that gets piled into your charecter through the academy in terms of stats is enough to snowball you through the game, but there's also other cool features (SPOILER) such as powerful charecters who become ghost teachers at your academy upon death that give future charecters skill points in certain skill trees(/SPOILER).\n\n\nAnyhow, if you feel 50 hours of quality entertainment is worth 10 bucks or so to get this game, give it a try.

La idea es que es m\u00e1s accesible que estos, con elementos modernos como el sistema \"hereditario\" del Rogue Legacy (conseguir mejoras permanentes para tus futuros h\u00e9roes) y con menos habilidades de lo normal pero bastante originales.\n\nLo primero que llama la atenci\u00f3n es que gr\u00e1ficamente es bastante aceptable y la banda sonora mola. Es adem\u00e1s muy divertido y el creador tiene buen sentido del humor (claro que necesitas entender ingl\u00e9s para pillar algo). Hay varios arquetipos de clases, pero el juego te permite mezclar habilidades de cualquiera de ellas, sean activas como pasivas. Est\u00e1n las t\u00edpicas clases de guerrero, arquero, mago y nigromante, y otras m\u00e1s curiosas como el noble del sur (uno basado en una barra de furia) y el \"Bannerman\" (utiliza lanza y banderas con efectos de \u00e1rea para el combate).\n\nAhora, no os recomiendo el juego, porque me he sentido mas o menos \"estafado\". El juego sali\u00f3 recientemente de Early Access pero yo os digo que no est\u00e1 terminado: he podido contar unos cuantos bugs notables que yo creo que son imperdonables para un juego aparentemente fuera de fase beta, pero bueno, \u00a1quiz\u00e1s soy un exagerado! asi que mejor os voy a listar algunos para que llegu\u00e9is a vuestras propias conclusiones [hay alg\u00fan spoiler]:\n\n-Si entr\u00e1is y sal\u00eds inmediatamente en una mazmorra, las m\u00fasicas se superponen y est\u00e1is obligados a reiniciar la partida si no quer\u00e9is tener un dolor de cabeza.\n\n-Al entrar por tercera vez en un campamento t\u00edpico de los que hay pegados a un camino, las texturas de la hierba se estropean.\n\n-En el minimapa tienes una lista de las localizaciones que hay en el juego. Si descubres m\u00e1s de 20 zonas, te tendr\u00e1s que fastidiar porque dicha lista no tiene barra de scroll y se comer\u00e1 la mayor\u00eda de lugares, cosa bastante insoportable sobretodo porque SPOILER \"\"\"Para encontrar la zona final del juego te dan un mapa donde te dice la localizaci\u00f3n, y me es imposible averiguarla por esto\"\"\" SPOILER\n\n-(ESTE BUG HA SIDO SOLUCIONADO) En el juego existen los AP (action points), que es el sistema que tiene el juego para determinar qu\u00e9 personaje es m\u00e1s r\u00e1pido en un combate al hacer una acci\u00f3n, si tu o el/los enemigo/s. Lo normal es tener 100 AP inicialmente. Bien, pues si te equipas un objeto que te penalice hasta tener 80 AP, cuando trates de descansar, un enemigo cualquiera te despertar\u00e1 y te atacar\u00e1 hasta que te mueras (aunque sean 60 golpes como me pas\u00f3 a mi) sin que tengas oportunidad de responder.\n\n-En la academia pasan cosas como que al tocar varias paredes de una habitaci\u00f3n el juego te pregunta si quieres salir de la academia (\u00bf??\u00bf\u00bf?).\n\n-A veces al cargar la partida, la barra de habilidades aparece \"cortada\". S\u00f3lo ves dos tercios de los iconos de tus habilidades.\n\n\nCon esto quiero decir, es normal que un juego tenga bugs, pero hay juegos (los que est\u00e1n bien pulidos) que jugando una partida normal, sin profundizar, no te encuentras con ninguna o casi ninguna imperfecci\u00f3n, pero lo que me he encontrado en Dungeonmans me ha dejado una sensaci\u00f3n similar a cuando vi por primera vez a un gigante en Skyrim peg\u00e1ndole un mazazo a un mamut y envi\u00e1ndolo por los aires: Lo miras, y te quedas en plan \"este juego no est\u00e1 acabado\", pero mas o menos te la pela y le sigues echando horas porque es un juego muy divertido.\n\nY sobre el balance del juego, al igual que en muchos PDLs, te encontrar\u00e1s con momentos a veces f\u00e1ciles y a veces casi imposibles. El juego de todos modos est\u00e1 un poco desequilibrado, hay ciertos monstruos que son anormalmente fuertes en comparaci\u00f3n con otros monstruos de su nivel, asunto que creo que el desarrollador dijo que iba a solucionar.\n\nDungeonmans es un PDL de estilo cl\u00e1sico, accesible y mola en general. Ahora, os aviso de que por ahora no est\u00e1 acabado por mucho que os lo quieran hacer creer.

The game takes a little getting used to even with a passing familiarity with the genre. \n\nThere are certain aspects of the game that are not very intuitive right now. If you clear the dungeon closest to your starting Dungeonmans Academy, you'll already out-class all the other surrounding dungeons, with no option to go inside them. You do get an option to receive a handful of loot from them, but it's typically not that great. Once you find a dungeon you can enter, the difficulty is typically much higher than you can handle with just the first cave's loot and experience. \n\nThis quirk resulted in several futile attempts at the game until I figured out that you can enter a dungeon and leave, which marks that dungeon and lets you re-enter it later even if your level \"surpasses\" it. Since this issue has a workaround, it's not game-breaking or anything, but I do think the level restrictions could be loosened or allow a third option to enter a weaker dungeon anyway, rather than just \"auto-clear\" and \"leave it alone\". \n\nThere are some dialog options in your Dungeonmans Academy that seem to do nothing, particularly with the museum curator. I've not run into very many other bugs.\n\nIn all other areas, Dungeonmans surpassed my expectations. The graphics are simple but look great with some nice detail, and are suited to the old-school style of gameplay. There is a variety of classes to play as to change things up if you get bored playing the game one way. The music is pretty good, and gives a nice atmosphere to the various dungeons. There are multiple dungeon \"types\", such as swamp, catacombs/graveyard, ruins (typical dungeon), and tower. Each dungeon type provides a different experience, and I found it a nice changeup while playing. \n\nThere are also some nice touches such as secret doors, magic pools that will randomly help/harm you, and portals that may take you to rooms filled with either monsters, secret shops, or several strong \"champion\" level monsters.

The game pokes fun at all the tropes of \"dungeon games\" monsters range from your mundane \"Skrobold\" play on kolbold to the more serious bad ass super elite named monsters that will one to two shot you even when fully prepared and buffed *they still ahve silly names though xD*   there are still a bunch of hidden things im sure i have yet to experience.  \n\nFor those lookign for a quick game during work or to waste 30 min or HOURS this game fills that niche perfectly you can stop anytime save and exit and come back to exactly wher eyou left off  a godsend for those of us with abrupt or hectic schedules. \n\nThe downside is until you get used to how the game plays and its still many bugs that will kill you in combat. You will die...many many many times. after about your 10th character you will have a good idea of what works and what doesnt work. I think im on my 100th character and even after all those deaths im still not even close to get to the end content *mainly because im a dumb ass* but also because bugs keep killing my character either through sheer brilliance or inability my characters always tend to die becuase of a glitch. which can be INFURIATING especially when youve worked ahrd and fianlly get a character a suffient level 8+ and soemthing happens and BLAM dead.\n\nCharacter death is BRUTAL. you loose all gear, all equipment and all items GONE. when you create a new character you must level them up and attempt to retrieve w/e kille dyour previous character. btw the thing that kille dyour character takes over the dungeons as a boss and gets a serious boost so if you end up opening a secret door to a boss that one shots you might as well write off that dungeon because your not getting that shit back. if your previous character was of sufficient level you will get ONE ITEM randomly choosen typically a weapon some XP and all the quest items they had. which isnt to bad but when you spend rescources on a character and end up compeltley loosing those rescources without a way to retrieve all that great gear it puts a sever damper on your mood especially when the GAME kille dyour character and not your inability theres a difference when the GAME kills a character and when you screw up and take a bite bigger than you can chew or get yoruself into an unwinnable situation.\n\n\nstill even with those gripes i cant put this down i keep coming back to it like some stockholm syndrome patient. I sound liek some beaten wife  \"it's not bad ALL THE TIME\" Im kidding though Dungeonmans in my most humble of opinion is a great little roguelike title with some good gameplay and challenging scenarios with heavy ephasis on tactics and rescource managment always weighing wether youshould upgrade a certian piece of gear or take on that \"Adventurous\" level dungeon rather than the mundane one.\n\nThe creator is constantly updating the game and has made an easy way of sending in feedback via an ingame menu. and actaulyl takes that feed back and FIXES the bugs. not to toot my own horn but i've persoanlly pointed out about 20 or so bugs or more and they were fixed within the month!\n\nAll in all Dungeonsmans is worth the money the sheer amount of glee you get after killing a boss that has killed off countless nubmers of your heroes with a special scroll or skill and outwitting the game while rare is worht the ego boost and worth every penny.", "timestamp_created": 1419133952, "timestamp_updated": 1419133952, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500541", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13487792": {"recommendationid": "13487792", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970279423", "num_games_owned": 147, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 901, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1419653878}, "language": "english", "review": "As someone who's played a lot of RPGs, this was a nice change of pace from the sometimes grim reality of dying in other games.

I like having classes that play differently to try out and that is true here for the few provided. \n[*]- : Shallow character depth. Especially a negative since the trailer advertises as 'hella character depth' instead of advertising it as casual. There are a few different trees with a few skills each, none particularly complicated. \n[*]- : Little combat strategy.  Fights are very very light on strategy and tend to get repetitive after you get a few levels and unlock your small handful of skills. Enemies are pretty dumb and don't have a huge range of variety.\n[*]-: Boring items. Each character has their weapon type and armor type to focus on. Everything else you find is trash which you just sell or have your blacksmith melt for more pointless upgrades on future characters. The weapons you come use only have a few tiers and the modifiers on magic items are pretty basic number booths that don't really make any difference. Loot just isn't very fun at all. The shops are all pretty terrible and all sell the same exact things. The only reason I'd bother selling loot there is to buy potions. There's an upgrade system for the towns which is a nice idea but implemented badly as the upgrades don't make much of a difference and because it limits upgrades based on how far from your academy they are, even when you upgrade a town you just keep advancing beyond it making it feel wasted. \n[/list]\n\nI love the ideas of enhancing towns and upgrading the academy.. but there is just.. nothing there.

Turn based combat in a square tile grid, full keyboard controls, randomly generated loot and monsters, secret passages and a progression system[levelling up] for your character. Diverse and varied classes, albeit in my opinion there is a distinct lack of classes, which I would count as a negative but hopefully classes can be added later or modded in. It also has the characteristic difficulty, if it is slightly easier than most rougelikes but, if you're not careful you can find yourself out of your element and dead quite quickly.\n\nWhat it lacks in the hardcore area it makes up for in the actual playability, graphical fidelity and clarity. While there are some elements of the UI I'm not super impressed with generally speaking its miles ahead in terms of accessability so - if you've been looking to get into the rouguelike genre I think this would be a good place to start. The only problem is that you will probably miss out on a lot of the genre related jokes but there is plenty of humour to be found here which is tucked away in descriptions and text which you only read once.\n\nIn terms of graphics its not amazing, but compared to others of the genre I feel its miles ahead, which a strong aestethic and good clarity you'll never be squinting at the screen trying to see if thats a goblin[g] or an arch wizard[Z]. \n\nThe combat, in my opinion is very advanced for a game of the genre. It takes the basics of rouguelike principles and throws a few wrenches in the works. Time honoured tactics of hiding in doorways to funnel enemies in one by one work great. That is until you encounter more advanced monsters - who can fling you around the room, dash through you to surround you and knock you back either throwing you into a room filled with bomb throwing maniacs who are as much a danger to themselves as you or getting behind you turning your careful funnel into a two versus one. Additionally some monsters will spawn barricades and ice blocks to trap you in with their friends which keeps the combat frantic and yet the player must be deliberate and pray that the carpenter bee doesn't summon ANOTHER barricade in the way of the door lest the swarm of blue lizard men things do horrible things with their claws and spears to the heroes hasty behind.\n\nEach class has a distinct playstyle, the gentleman AKA barbarian builds up fury when hit and can unlease it in a tantrum, giving them a lot of buffs to damage as would be expected. The Bannerman fights with a spear and favours being fairly immobile with lifesteal and ranged purity magic - though he can get a move on when he needs to, opting for a more mobile polearm and bow style or entrenching with a heavy shield and poleaxe to cut down multiple foes at a time. You'll be spoiled for choice as each class can be played in a variety of ways. Even the necromancer doesn't really use magic as you would expect, instead generating a resource from corpses that forms the basis of all their spells. Summon the undead to do your bidding or blow up a corpse potentially chaining through an entire infested room causing utter destruction and chaos. There are meaningful choices and paths to take for each class and I think this is one of the games biggest strengths.\n\nAs for the permanent buffs that can be obtained from adventuring and making it back to the Academy alive? They are, for the most part, fairly underwhelming and are more of a kickstart to your adventure allowing you to optionally identify some of the potions and scrolls in the game although - if you like to kick it old school you can and instead discover things as you go. To be fair though, as you progress later in the game some of the artifacts can be quite awesome. Even the stat gains you earn permanently seem to have diminishing returns meaning its hard to get to the point where every character will be utter ownage and its more of a long term slight boost with each run. \n\nAll things considered, this is a refreshing and interesting title in the rouguelike genre. Rouguelike players are notoriously new-game-ophobic as they're comfortable in their habits. This title makes some great efforts to shake things up and I think it has done so tremendously. My only real negative for recommending it is the price point, I'm not sure the game feels justified at the 15$ mark[15Euro for us europeans] but I have got nearly 3 times the entertainment time of a movie ticket for around the same price so I can't complain too much. I probably would have avoided this title at the 20$ mark, but at 15$ it less questionable. If you're not sold on this review but are interested I'd recommend picking it up on sale for anything around or under the 10$ mark.

For a bit of background, I have played quite a bit of the genre from the original Rogue and own Tales of Maj'Eyal, Dungeons of Dredmore, etc.  I bought this for full retail price, and at the time of this review have 14 hours completed over 4 characters.  So why was this worth my $14.99?\n\nStreamlined Gameplay:  Dungeonmans provides a streamlined experience with lower barriers to entry than most other games in the genre.   With about 75 skills spread over 8 or so categories you can mix and match your build to your tastes.  While fewer than Dredmore and ToME, I was easily able to understand each category quickly while providing enough flexibility to create interesting decisions during my character progression.   Another great feature is the ability to autocomplete dungeons (with a nice jackpot of loot) that would be of trivial difficulty to your character.  This cuts down the grinding a great deal.\n\nPermadeath and the University:  Yes this game features permanent character death, but unlike most games in the genre Dungeonmans has your core base of operations: the University.  The University contains lots of fun *persistent* features that allows your next run to be that much easier.  These include autoidentification, bonuses to your starting equipment, additional mob information, and free stat boosts.  This greatly cuts down on the intimidation factor since you know each successive run you'll be just that much stronger and wiser.\n\nSense of Humor:  This is hard to describe without experiencing it yourself, but this game has a cheeky sense of humor that I appreciate.  The main tips area in your University is literally a Wall of Text.  \n\nAccessible Developers:  If you couldn't tell by the discussion responses, the developers care about their product enough to invest their time to address issues, concerns, and even thank those that are enjoying their experience.  I have seen one even visiting Twitch streams providing advice and support.   I would take a dozen developers like this over a Triple A company that puts out a broken and unsupported product.\n\nValue:  With so many games left unplayed, I started to valuate my future purchase differently.  How much per entertainment hour would I get?  Honestly I can't answer that question for you.

I have no idea if the game is possible to beat on a first attempt, but I certainly don't think I could. \n\nGames it reminds me of: Tales of Maj'eyal, Nethack, Sword of the Stars the Pit (but much better IMO).", "timestamp_created": 1418349830, "timestamp_updated": 1418349830, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.999438", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13323046": {"recommendationid": "13323046", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056386352", "num_games_owned": 433, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 171, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1418590575}, "language": "english", "review": "\u041e\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043c\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u0440\u043e\u0433\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043a. \u0425\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u043a\u0430\u043a \u043a\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u044d\u043b\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u043e\u0432 \u0442\u0438\u043f\u0430 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u043c\u0430\u0441\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0442\u0438, \u0440\u0430\u043d\u0434\u043e\u043c\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0443\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0435\u0439, \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u0431\u043e\u0435\u0432, \u0442\u043e\u043d\u043d \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043d\u043e\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043b\u0443\u0442\u0430, YASD \u0438 \u0442.\u0434., \u0442\u0430\u043a \u0438 \u0441\u043e\u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0432\u0432\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0432\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0447\u043a\u0438 \u0431\u0430\u0437\u044b \u0438 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0442\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0445 \u043f\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043c\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432 \u0433\u0435\u0440\u043e\u044f (\u0447\u0442\u043e-\u0442\u043e \u0432\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0435 Rogue Legacy;

As a recent graduate of Dungeonmans Academy, you are sent forth to make the world safe for ordinary townsfolk. You'll face dozens of dungeon-dwelling enemies, from strange and exotic creatures, to knights and wizards, and eventually come face to face with the Dread Purpleonians.\n\nAfter picking from among some truly abysmal starting stats, your hero-to-be can select from among several pre-built classes, or mix and match masteries to create a customized monster-bashing powerhouse. Each of these classes has a very different style of play, allowing for different tactics. Whether you favor a Wizardmans, Necromanser, Rangermans, or Southern Gentlemans, you'll need to keep an eye on important resource pools like Health, Stamina, Foom, Ire, and Deadpulses to unleash powerful attacks or invoke defensive manuvers.\n\nThe overworld is persistent -- although you can generate a new world map at any time --but each dungeon or tower is randomly generated, as are the beasts and treasures within. Defeat Champions to collect Proofs of Stremf, trophies that allow you to enhance your hero's stats and boost those of future graduates as well.

Its more than just running dungeons, you have your \"Dungeonmans Academy\" you need to bring things too to make it better, an overworld to explore, ect. Theres lots to do, many character class & traits choices. I havent played too much yet, but this looks like a Roguelike I'll have fun with.\n\nThe silly, however, is overpowering. Sometimes its amusing, but IMHO it beats you over the head a little too much. It may be funny if you're a teenage guy, I'm a 30-something chick, so I can't judge there. Still, theres lots of clever Roguelike humor for long-term rogue players. \n\nIt is out of E.

Come on, if youre going to be silly, give us some funny icons to work with those genders! \n\nThe graphics are pixel tiles. They are colorful and cartoony and fit well with the style of the game. My one (minor) complaint is getting new weapons and armor does nothing to your tile. Like if you have the barbarian shirtless guy with the sword, he remains the shirtless guy with the sword even if youre wearing platemail and carrying an axe. Its kind of nitpicky, but Roguelikes have progressed from the days of \"@\", or even the tile systems of *Angband. I love games like Tales of Maj'Eyal, or Rogue's Tale where your tile changes depending on what you have equipped.

The Dungeonmans starter area known as The Academy is the main hub of these innovations. The Academy allows you to make subtle tweaks to your experience. For instance bringing artifacts back to the academy lets future Dungeonmans use stronger weapons and armor then would normally be available to a new graduate. There are several non-player characters at The Academy who can increase new graduate advantages with the riches that your last Dungeonmans gave their life for.\n\n     This game also has a fully realized class system using an intuitive point allocation system.  You also have the freedom to build your own Dungeonmans instead of using a prebuilt starting class. You are allowed to mix and match between magic, melee, and ranged skills over your career. This game has soundtracks, sound effects, and sprite based art that helps to create captivating rogue like environments. The world of Dungeonmans is populated with towns and dungeons galore.\n\n     Dungeons have ominous soundtracks and gritty sprites, while the towns are depicted with cheerful music and colorful sprites. Towns provide another place to enhance your experience. Towns can be upgraded like The Academy to give you better shop items from the local merchants. The dungeons vary in size, design and difficulty. Besides being filled with monsters, dungeons can have traps, secret treasures, and ultimately end with a showdown with its powerful master.\n\n     The advantages of the Academy are completely voluntary. If you\u2019re looking for a harsher challenge simply don't enhance The Academy and your new Dungeonmans will have no advantages when they start out. Even with the advantages that the Academy provides, you'll still find that the best equipped and experienced players will find challenges in Dungeonmans readily available. This game has provided me with many hours of entertainment. If you\u2019re looking for a rogue like with something new to offer, but the difficulty the genre is known for then look no further.

It had a great mix between being challenging and being accessible. The name of this Roguelike was Castle of the Winds and it has long held a place in my heart as being the best of show out there for this genre. Now I think after many years Castle of the Winds has finally been toppled in my eyes. \n\nDungeonmans is the best Roguelike I have played in a long time- it has an easy to learn and use gameplay which is unforgivable the further out you go. The game captures everything that I loved about Castle of the Winds- the crisp but simple art, the spellbooks for learning new spells, the absurdity of monsters you find in the deep... Then it puts everything into overdrive. With Dungeonmans one of the most innovative features is the Academy which grows based on deeds, you don't simply pour money into this academy to make it better, you fill it with the blood and sweat of a ton of dead dungeonmans. As someone who always likes persistant strength options in Roguelikes, this is good, but what makes it better is the fact that all of the unlocked perks are optional to pick up. If the game is too easy for you, just don't pick up the perk at the start. No harm done. You will still do awesomely if you are skilled enough for the task. \n\nThe music of Dungeonmans is also pretty phenominal due to being the work of the great Zircon, a remix artist who makes the game come alive. The art is pretty standard, but the simplistic nature of it actually works well with what is trying to be achived. As you go deeper into the many dungeons you will find an increasingly powerful variety of loot capable of making you feel like a king- and if you die while carrying one of your favourite swords it is even possible to find the sword in a later playthrough in a more powerful form. \n\nThere is so much to unlock in this game too- you can find hidden skills, dungeons, artifacts of power and more based on how you play and what you do. I won't spoil them, but basically the game rewards you all the way in the best possible way. Overall- this game scratches many itches for me. The itch for a good Roguelike, the itch for constructing my own \"x\", the itch to find a game I can happily play for countless hours-\n\nFull disclosure though- At the end of this I feel that I should say I was a kickstarter backer. While I don't belive my experience has been coloured by that fact, it is possible that some of my praise is the work of a Rosetinted Glasses look of someone who didn't want to have wasted their money. So please do take my review with that in mind,\n\nEDIT: Also one slight warning- The game is best played with the numpad for movement so if you have a laptop which does not have one... keep that in mind. There is mouse control but it makes the game seem a lot more \"slippery\". Though, it should also be said numpad controls is just another reason why this game is rocking it CoTW style.\n\n<3", "timestamp_created": 1418158676, "timestamp_updated": 1511374751, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 155, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.880415", "comment_count": "28", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13279326": {"recommendationid": "13279326", "author": {"steamid": "76561197976612276", "num_games_owned": 234, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 6442, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505524181}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is as close to the original Rogue-like I have ever played.  10/10 well worth the money!", "timestamp_created": 1418021965, "timestamp_updated": 1418021965, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.390456", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "13260070": {"recommendationid": "13260070", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998464306", "num_games_owned": 112, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 74, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1408814003}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the better roguelikes I've played in the last few years.

[/i]:D:\n\nThis is a traditional roguelike with a tileset, and a persistent base called the Dungeonmans Academy that can be upgraded, and all features unlocked/improved can and will be used by future characters. In the beginning, you make a world, then you make your character. The character starts out in the Academy in your world, and you go forth from there. The Overworld is generated when you make your world, and stays the same, though the dungeons continue to be randomly generated. When you die, you make a new character, and go back to the same world with the Academy you've been working on. You can have 3 seperate worlds at once.\n\nThere are plenty of skills and passives you can unlock when you level, supporting many styles of play: Dual Wielding, Sword and Board, Magic, Two-Handers, Necromancy, Bows, Spears, Light/Medium/Heavy Armor(or Light \"Armor\"/Medium Armor/Real Armor as the game calls them). And I know I missed a few. \n\nThere are also unidentified and randomized names for scrolls and potions too. The large variety of potions and scrolls reminds me of Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup.\n\nThere's also a lot of goo humor in the game, from the dialogue, item/skill/spell descriptions, and events.\n\nI definitely recommend this game to any fan of roguelikes.\n\n[b]Edit:[/b] Since it sorta looks like they saw my review with a suggestion and listened, I'm gonna try and help more, and give suggestions. I'll update this fairly often.\n[list]\n[*] Only real problem now is that getting to the center of mountain ranges is a pain, since I hate having unexplored areas within my travel range. It'd be nice to have mountains traversable, but take longer to do so or guarantee us being attacked. In the Roguelike 'One Way Heroics', you have to hold the direction key in the mountains direction for 3 or so seconds, then you move onto that tile. Maybe have it so that happens, and you're guaranteed to be attacked by mountain bandits/scrobolds.\n[i]This was updated 3 times so far on February 8th, 2015[/i]", "timestamp_created": 1417182496, "timestamp_updated": 1423465937, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526423", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "13095852": {"recommendationid": "13095852", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025397681", "num_games_owned": 52, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 27200, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501028233}, "language": "english", "review": "Dungeonmans is a [b]huge value buy[/b]. I'm over 100 hours in and it still provides new and interesting moments every time I play.\n\nIt's a rogue-like and that means challenging permadeath gameplay; however, the game also has the \"Dungeonmans Academy\" which provides limited permanence and can make the game more forgiving over time for less skilled players. The combat is highly tactical (all turn-based) and different combinations of enemies continue to provide unique challenges even after you're familiar with how to defeat each enemy individually. The main level cap is 15, which sounds low, but each level represents a significant bump in power and challenge.\n\nCharacter advancement is simple, yet rewarding. Powers can be chosen freely without class restrictions, so you can have a wizard clad in full plate wielding a giant axe if you want. Some powers can only activate with certain gear equipped and a small handful of the most powerful abilities have to be \"unlocked\", but those restrictions all feel quite reasonable.\n\nOne aspect of this game that's hard to describe is the humor and the overall feel. As you well might gather from the title \"Dungeonmans\", the game doesn't take itself too seriously. Oddball monster varieties, subtle self-reflective mocking of RPG/adventure game tropes, and humorous flavor text are woven into nearly every piece of the game. It helps balance the seriousness of the gameplay, frequently giving you a reason to smile while playing. It's also nice that the humor is unimposing and unpresumptuous--it doesn't try too hard to make you laugh. It reminds me a lot of the feel of a tabletop D&D session with old friends--occasionally serious, sometimes laugh-out-loud funny, always enjoyable.\n\nThe game is highly replayable for a number of reasons. 1) You usually know exactly why you die when you die (needed to drink a healing potion 3 rounds ago, shouldn't have entered that large room at half health, etc). 2) Since the academy makes subsequent attempts incrementally easier, there is always the challenge to complete the game in fewer characters. 3) The randomly generated dungeons occasionally have hidden rooms with very challenging encounters (sometimes optional, sometimes not). On later playthroughs, you can keep it interesting by opting in to these big challenges. 4) There are enough rare/unique items that I still see new loot nearly every playthrough. 5) The developer has teased several types of end-game content which will likely be available once the game is out of early access.\n\nThe last thing I will say is that the developer has done an incredible job with the \"early access\" phase of this game. He is highly responsive to individual players, he openly shares progress, and regularly incorporates community feedback into the game development. He streams development on Twitch and releases updates regularly. That's exactly why a lot of gamers prefer indies over AAA publishers, so we need to make sure to show our appreciation for the ones who go out of their way to focus on community.\n\n[h1]Summary[/h1]\n[b]PROS[/b]\n[list]\n[*]old school rogue-like challenge\n[*]high quality pixel art with a retro feel\n[*]both traditional keyboard and point-and-click input supported\n[*]awesome retro-RPG-inspired soundtrack by Zircon (of OCRemix renown)\n[*]great replayability\n[*]highly engaged, responsive indie developer\n[/list]\n\n[b]CONS[/b]\n[list]\n[*]PC only\n[*]difficulty may be frustrating at first if you're new to rogue-likes\n[*]sprites are not fully animated (abilities are, but the sprites themselves remain static)\n[*]difficulty curve spikes at some levels and falls off at others (may be resolved with full game release)\n[/list]", "timestamp_created": 1417040367, "timestamp_updated": 1417040367, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.539095", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "13071267": {"recommendationid": "13071267", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017111194", "num_games_owned": 404, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 858, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1440474979}, "language": "english", "review": "Dungeonmans is just the very basics of what is needed for a rogue-like game to work.

It looked like a typical sprite-based permadeath fantasy roguelike-like, something I'm not the biggest fan of.\n\nAppearances can be deceiving. Having logged many hours since, I find [i]Dungeonmans[/i] rather unique. There are roguelike elements, yes, but also a plethora of accessible game design concepts from other genres, some of which have been unjustly abandoned for years, all stuffed into the trappings of a modern indie game.\n\nRemember the simplistic visual charm of early turn-based PC RPGs, such as the SSI Gold Box D&D titles? [i]Dungeonmans[/i] has that. How about the grand, synthesized orchestral scores of early Playstation JRPGs? That's here, too. Weaponry with dramatic prefixes and suffixes that denote their crazy powers? A wide variety of procedurally-generated dungeon styles? Humorous tongue-in-cheek dialogue and item descriptions? Skill trees? Potions galore?\n\n[i]Dungeonmans[/i] is both a parody and an homage to the best aspects of role-playing games over the past two decades, and a sort of fast-paced frustration-free approach to the roguelike model. Yes, each Dungeonmans (or gender-equal Lady Dungeonmans) gets but one life to live, but they leave behind a wide selection of enhancements for the next adventurer in line, some more difficult to retrieve than others. Defeat is quickly forgotten, vengeance is sworn, and progress resumes on the path to crush your enemies.\n\nWhile all the post-mortem handouts make the game less punishing than the average roguelike, mistakes made in combat still lead to a swift death. However, once a player learns the effect of each skill, and how they interact with statistics and potion-based enhancements, progress is limited only by how aggressively you wish to press your luck. Bigger risks bring bigger rewards, and it feels pretty great to outsmart a party of high-level monsters, see them driven before you, then return triumphantly back to the Dungeonmans Academy with many Proofs of Stremf.\n\nThe numerous skill trees lead to many different but equally successful play styles, which keeps things fresh. Speedy players can blast through dungeons as a rampaging \u201cSouthern Gentlemans\u201d, while methodical players can become a plodding pillar of death with \u201cSword & Board\u201d. Understanding the abilities in each tree is essential when taking a Dungeonmans and the Academy to the highest level, and the truly skilled will leave behind only a few grave markers on the path to ultimate success.\n\nThe visual presentation is a good fit with the gameplay, with colorful sprites and environments hearkening back to the pixel art of the 1990s. The avatar selection for the player is limited but memorable, with a range of exaggerated, comical designs to choose from. Distinct sound effects make in-game events easy to identify, and Zircon's soundtrack is fantastic, especially for fans of Hitoshi Sakimoto (Final Fantasy Tactics, Vagrant Story).\n\nSo what's missing in Early Access, as of the current v1.6c build? Odds and ends, really. Some graphics are absent, or need to be reworked to better fit the style. There are loopholes to farm stat bonuses that haven't been closed. End game content is sparse. The highest tiers of weapons and armor aren't available. However, unlike other alphas, the game is stable and highly playable. You can create characters, kill monsters, hear the lamentations of their gender-neutral life partners, buy stuff, sell stuff, read books, burn books, slam bad guys, slam potions, and I have yet to get tired of any of it.\n\nOn top of all that, the creator of the game is extremely accessible. Jim hosts bi-weekly live development streams, where soon-to-be-released content is tweaked before an audience.

To do so, you delve deep into the several dungeons, ruins, temples and other dens of danger waiting for you to make one wrong move.\n\nIn the vein of Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup, the game is turn-based, with the \"You move, I move\" style in that sort of game, but that simplicity gives way to the dozens of skills your enemies wield to make your job a bit more difficult: cryomancers summon deadly icenados to stop you dead on your tracks, Giant Carpenter Bees block your way with ramparts, and let us not forget the Dreaded Jabber-Snap... It's up to you and your inventory to sort these motley miscreants out, whether by sword, spell or scroll.\n\nLeading these dangerous mobs are the Champions, souped-up, buffed-up monsters well capable of turning your Dungeonmans into Dungeonmash if you're not careful. Should you succeed in delaying your inevitable demise by killing them off, you are rewarded with Proofs of Stremf and Relics, oh so useful for upgrading your stats and your Academy. You read that right, the Academy: with each successful item return to the Headmaster, you are granted boosts and passive buffs to your Library, Alchemist, Blacksmith and Museum, giving future graduates a  handy leverage against the dangers awaiting them.\n\nFinally, there is the death system: when you die, and you will, your Dungeomans is dead and gone, with only a tombstone to remember him by. But fret not!: you did not die in vain. When exploring your previous place of death, future graduates may find the body and soul of the Dungeonmans, which grants you stat boosts and, were he powerful enough in his previous life, an artifact weapon, infused with the true Dungeonmans power.\n\nAs the game is, it might seem short in content at times (the developer admitted to the need for more unique weapons and mobs), but what is there is enough to leave us oogling at and begging for more.

Dungeonmans is a must-buy for fans of RPGs, Roguelikes, and fantasy.  \n\nI've played this game through from Early Access  (ver 1.5.1 to be precise) to Full Release (ver 1.02), so I can comment both on the game and it's evolution.  The short form is \"it's great and a lot of fun and you should buy it,\" but to really appreciate Dungeonmans, you have to go into the details - because there's so much to it, and all the elements come together to make something truly special.\n\nDungeonmans is a mix of Roguelike, mild setting building, character improvement, and humor that's quite enjoyable and good-natured, while taking some real planning and tactics.\n\nStart an academy, go forth as a Dungeonmans (the term is gender-neutral) of a given class.  Find loot, bring back artifacts, improve the academy, die horribly, come back as someone else, and venture on.  Much like Rogue Legacy and similar games as you adventure you find things that improve  things for future characters - in this case the academy, your starting character's equipment and knowledge.  Books improve the library, equipment improves the alchemy lab, knowledge improves the museum, leftover equipment lets the blacksmith make new things, and so on.  Sure your character may die, but their legacy lives on (and dies on as you burn through characters).  High-level characters that die can come back as teaching ghosts and characters can retire to teach or do other things.\n\nCharacter building presents you with plenty of choices.  You can start with a premade class or customize from the start with a general Dungeonmans class.  Pick the skills you want to learn and build, and develop your own playstyle.  My personal favorite is a kind of arcane archer, but maybe you'll favor a heavily armored necromancer, a dual-wileding trickster who creates duplicates, or a warrior armed with magical banners.  There's plenty of fun strategies you can come up with depending on playstyle.\n\nImproving the academy and towns, finding resources, and more enhances the chance of current and future Dungeonmans to live longer, venture further, and perhaps unlock the mystery of the game.  Strategic choices, management, and thoughts of the next student really weigh on your mind.  Take a special weapon knowing it may end up collecting dust with your corpse - or that it may let you survive.  Melt down enough gear to build upgrades or sell it for cash (and knowing a future Dungeonmans can buy it later)?   Options once chosen affect the game later.\n\nThere's enchanting of items as well - though unless you spend the resources to do it specifically with Upgrade Hammers (that can break overpowered items), it's random.  Still, with a few scrolls and luck (or blowing a lot of resources recovered from old weapons) you can craft some enjoyably insane stuff.  Want a sword that freezes people in place and sets them on fire?  A suit of armor that resists, well, everything?  Go ahead and make it - or use a Solvent scroll to start over.  You can even find blueprints to make special items if you have the resources.\n\nAdventuring starts out as pretty straightforward adventure-battle-loot.  Over time it evolves as you face more and more powerful enemies, make decisions about using artifacts and crafting items, or figure which towns to upgrade.  The game never becomes too complicated, but it does ramp up in complexity over time.\n\nFinally, there's a lot of depth to the game.  Right when you think the dungeons look alike, you discover something else.  A random boss gives you a chance at improvement. or death  A new monster surprises you.  An item you find is enjoyably bizarre and useful.  Modified towns have new inventory.  Character's that have passed may leave surprising legacies.  Dungeonmans is packed with things to discover.\n\nBest of all, as of this writing, the developers are actively bugfixing and improving the game.  That's the kind of commitment to quality that not only makes it more fun and gives me more confidence, but speaks to the level of commitment to making a good game.  As of this writing I'm on my third playthrough, which should give you an idea of just how fun the game is and how much is in it.\n\nAn enjoyable game with a sense of humor that delivers adventure, challenge, and surprises - all with a sense of sheer, good-natured fun. Well worth the purchase.\n\nAlso worth playing through twice.

Maybe your would-be hero's stats aren't up to par - you can dismiss him from the academy and pick another candidate. \n\nThen you go out into the world map, like in TOME, looking for monsters (random encounters) and dungeons.

Each class starts with different player abilities which you can choose to level up as you play on through the game.\nA key feature to me that makes it stand out is the fact that when you level up and choose new abilities you can choose any from the skill tree, even if that was not the class you chose to play in. Feel like running around with a shield as a Rangermans? Well, you're free to do so. Just...don't.\nThe game, like all roguelikes, has permadeath but that's not the end of your adventure. As you travel through the world and various dungeons you'll kill bosses and collect artifacts and books. Both of these things can be used to level up your 'Academy' which is where you, and all new-spawns will start. Upgrading the academy and bringing back artifacts unlocks things like 'all level 1 potions identified for every new Dungeonman you play with, so even though you lose your progress and level on your Dungeonman when you die, you don't feel like you're starting over entirely. \n\nI've played games like Dungeons of Dredmoor, Rogue Legacy and other modern Rogue-likes and they are great but there is something about Dungeonmans that keeps me wanting to come back and die just once more.\nAnd you will come back to it, over and over, and most likely die, over and over, but dying never felt this good before. \nI should also mention that whilst I play keyboard-only, for those who aren't too comfortable with that there is an option to use your mouse aswell :)\n\nThere isn't too much else I can say about the game, the simplicity and beauty of it is in playing it for yourself. Now that the game is out of Early Access it's content rich and even more fun than before. \nSo if you want a modern yet honest-to-the-name rogue-like with tons of loot, enemies, a soundtrack that really makes you feel epic and dungeon after dungeons after dungeon then this is the game for you.\n\nJust remember, as the developer says himself. \nDon't.

Things like when you get new skills they aren't automatically placed on your hotbar, and trying to drag a skill in icon form from the skill tree to your hotbar crashes the game.\n\nThere is quite a bit of persistance though. You are always upgrading your academy. The world map seems always the same - at least with a new character with the same academy.\n\nThe overall feel is like as if they made Rogue Legacy (a roguelite platform game) into an actual roguelike game. You even pick 2 perks for each new character.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1401310199, "timestamp_updated": 1401310199, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490080", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "10268065": {"recommendationid": "10268065", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996866336", "num_games_owned": 1398, "num_reviews": 54, "playtime_forever": 3553, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507308854}, "language": "english", "review": "In Dungeonmans you play as dungeonmans.

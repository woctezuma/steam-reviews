More content to be added, but even without that content it's still sitting at a \"tentative buy\" for the quality an ingenuity of tactical turn based strategy it already includes. The daily challenges add some additional time that I haven't explored.\n\nCurrently at Alpha5 update, and to be honest I put this far more in the XCOM category than the roguelike category. Personally, I think it's a bit of a stretch to call it a \"rogue-lite\", but I tend to be a stickler for what goes in either of the latter categories (e.g. much of steam's \"rogue-lite\" tag is totally miscategorized. Permadeath + procgen != roguelite and certainly not roguelike).\n\nThat being said, don't buy the game as a \"roguelike\" game, buy it for what it is, which seems to be something that may well be up your alley, it has the procedural generation and permadeath features from roguelikes, \"level up\" type addons in the form of equips that XCOM has, with the killer feature of the ultimate form of turn based tactics (as in, you can manipulate the turns themselves, rewinding them for just you or for just everyone else, or both), the facets of which come off as  surprisingly simple-in-principle yet complex-in-combination actions.\n\nIs there more to be fleshed out? Certainly, it's in alpha status, so I'm really glad what's missing is \"fun to develop\" content rather than incredibly basic systems (like a save/load system or the mechanism/capacity for a tutorial, etc.). A short list of items that would be nice off the top of my head, to give you an idea of the types of things I'm talking about:\n\n* As of the current version I'd really like to see better use of the hacking mechanic to do something other than simple \"get through quietly\" or \"turn some of those useless drones from alert bots into slow suicide loving bullet absorbers\". Right now it's nice, but doesn't do a whole lot other than the same things more \"quietly\". There's also no failure chance, just a resource cost.\n* Shooting is 100% accurate. Either you hit, or it won't let you try.\n* While procedural generation is present, it leaves the levels _exactly_ the same every time and allows unlimited replays (unless you die), to earn more points. Even where it's something like \"search all the ashtrays\", only the same ashtrays ever contain packages and they are always in the same places.\n* Once you get a certain ability in game, you can't actually die until you run out of both health and time resources (you could kill an entire village by then). That ability needs a steadily increasing cost (for that matter, all of them do) per combat, to make it more interesting when you might want to use some of them.\n* AI should be willing to wait around for reinforcements. They have \"time\" on thier side, make me sweat while I waste it hanging around the corner in a one entrance room, rather than charge in single file while I shoot them in the brain before they can react (and pile up in front of the door).\n* When \"reinforcements arrive\" they really shouldn't all be just waiting by the car, which they seem to be. For that matter, way more roaming guards, basically everywhere, and it'd be nice to have a line of sight indicator vs guess or assume perfect vision (like I apparently have). Planning my route should not simply be a random chance experience.\n* Doors should be more easily visibile once discovered, I've flipped my camera around repeatedly, but sometimes I just cannot see that door until I get close enough to have it in a single walk's distance so I see it can be walked on vs can't.\n* More detrimental \"bash the door in\" mechanic. Right now it's quick, a bit loud (quick gunfight takes care of that) and that's it. Very little to no danger or drawback involved, since the fight always gives at least the same amount of time resources back that were spent in the fight itself.\n\nCertainly not a full list, there's more throughout the forums, but these are just my 2c as an example of the types of things I see could be improved. As you can see, they are in the direction of making the game more of what it is, rather than more towards a roguelike or changing a premise or similar. In my experience, these are the types of things developers enjoy adding, so I'm personally really looking forward to the direction the game is going in.\n\n***\n\nOriginally posted this as a comment on the forums, related to an ask regarding if this is more like a roguelike or like XCOM, but thought it made a decent enough review by itself.\n\nIn summary, it's quite a good game from everything that I've played thus far. I could see it potentially getting pretty easy somewhat quickly with the current amount of content but I can definately see it staying interesting if balance holds throughout the progression. In it's current form, I call it a \"tentative buy\" if you like tactical turn based strategy, and enjoy variations on the core mechanics of that genre while staying true to it's heart, but the \"tentative\" adjustment is purely for current content length of 4.5 hours.\n\nI played pretty directly through in 4.5 hours, didn't stop to replay except the first few levels, but didn't really feel the need to keep replaying other than that. I'd actually have fun playing the campaign a few times through even if this were all the content there was, primarily due to the procedurally generated levels. The daily challenges recently added should fill out time to play more for certain, though I tend not to really enjoy the \"daily\" types unless they implement a \"go back\" mechanism of some kind so I can replay the last X number at a shot (too many games to constantly log into one every day just for a few minutes of play). Because of that I haven't even checked daily challenge out, but might do so before my next campaign run.\n\nWith additional content that I'm quite certain will continue being added (due in no small part to the content being added itself), this would get upgraded to a \"definate buy\", though I rarely make reviews anymore off of \"what might it become on exiting EA\", and instead either hold off reviewing or leave a review on current content alone (as done here).", "timestamp_created": 1513377424, "timestamp_updated": 1513383352, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38371280": {"recommendationid": "38371280", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013204609", "num_games_owned": 1968, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 22, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510480064}, "language": "english", "review": "Fascinating mix of roguelike strategy, RPG, with a dash of rhythm and time manipulation thrown in.

You have to get in, accomplish your objective, and get out before you run out of time. Which initially seems like a lot, but when you accidentally walk into a bullet and unwind time so you can skip that damage, you burn through it fast. Because it's not just your agent's time your using, it's time as a resource, as a healthbar. I love how it works in motion, where it pushes you to keep moving - but doesn't make it so tight that you get frantic and stop thinking. Like Crypt of the Necrodancer's demand that you stay to the beat or lose the rhythm.\n\nCombat! Combat is turn-based, and if you can't explain your presence to the guards hanging out in these clubs, they'll break out their shotguns and smgs. You can do a light attack that doesn't take much time, or an aimed shot that does. You can dash to another square to evade a bullet, you can worry about cover, you can reload. It's pleasing - just enough XCOM to make it feel crunchy, just enough slick to keep you moving. And oh! When you win, you're asked if you want to drop the combat - finalize it, make it permanent. If you do, you get bonuses...and the game drops down into a super-close replay mode where it shows off your shots and dodges, where you get to watch the nightclub come gloriously alive as you're no longer floating above it thinking in terms of tactics, but just watching your burly agent bust down doors and flip his little cut-out (think paper mario!) avatar around as he meets guards and pushes past club-goers. It's a fantastic little touch that makes you really feel satisfied after combat, and gives you a breather before you get on with the mission.\n\nGosh, it's slick. But I digress: talking! Talking is simple and hilarious. Guards refuse to let you inside the club, guards demand to know who you are, and you can - as a burly aging man of an agent with a cybernetic arm - be gruff with them, tell them to fuck themselves, or try to flirt with them. And sometimes the flirting works! I haven't spent enough time with the chatting to tell you how deep the system goes, and there are emotions at play as well as picking logical answers, but it works, it adds a pleasantly human layer to these paper dolls. And if you get a guard mad, you get to swap to combat, which is fun.\n\nSo - let's see. There's a campaign structure, with different missions to do around Berlin. There's a shop, where you can trade currency (gained by completing missions with extra time) for upgrades, new weapons, new powers. There are complications like drones and security cameras.\n\nThere is, alas, the fact that this game is still in early access. The devs aim to have it done by early next year, which is exciting: what's here in the game is solid already, and any expansion to it would be wonderful. For now there's a handy little feedback button in-game that you can use at any time to send the devs a complaint or comment - the most seamless way I've ever seen to tell a dev what you think.\n\nLet me wrap this up: I think this game is brilliant. The atmospheric is astounding, the political overtones add that edge to this cyberpunk title, and the gameplay hits just right.

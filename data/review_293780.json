Where do I begin with this game? There's so much done right about this game that it's very quickly becoming one of my favourite rougelikes. Let's just dive right into the dungeon and start chopping off the pros and cons of this insanely unique and fast-paced competitive Gauntlet-inspired roguelike.\n\nPros:\n\n+Fast paced couch competition. The game is super quick to pick up and just as wasy to learn, utilizing only the movement directions and two buttons.\n+Most unique idea for a rogulike in a long time. The fact that AI or other friends control your ENTIRE JOURNEY is so fresh and innovative that I honestly can't think of a game to compare it to.\n+Amazing art direction and fluent animation. You can tell there was so much heart and soul poured into this game, I completely understand it taking 4 years of hard work and devotion to reach what we see today.\n+Brilliant soundtrack.\n+Unfair. Why is that a good thing? Because this game *prides* itself on being unfair in one way or another. It feels so amazing to be the big, bad monster that tears through the Hero or vice versa, and when you manage to wittle down or kill as like, a tiny fish while everyone else are hulking behemoths, everyone goes freaking bananas. It's such a fun concept, even when you're losing.\n+Cheap pricetag, sitting at only $15.\n+Amazing two \"bonus\" bosses which can be found and posessed by any player.\n\n\nAll that said, this is not a perfect game. It's close, and I've definitely got to mark it down as my favourite roguelike yet, but let's get into the downsides of this passion project.\n\nCons:\n\n-Lacks diversity. This is the game's biggest downfall. There's only one type of floor design, three total bosses, and the monsters themselves become a tad bit repetitive once you've been around the block. Don't get me wrong, it's still a good start, but I'd absolutely LOVE to see more variation in the future such as an ice temple or lava corridor in the later floors.\n-Little to no way to make the Hero actually do stuff; i.e, you can't stop them from stalling at all. If you're friends with some real dickbags, they can decide to troll you by finding a safe spot while being the Hero and just not do anything. The only area this really applies is the Shops due to slimes and ectoplasm, but it can still be an issue.\n-No online multiplayer.\n-Slimes have so much untapped potential. \n-Lackluster AI. It's either too easy and brainless or too ridiculously difficult. No inbetween.\n\n\nAll those things said, all-in-all I'd have to give this game a 9.5/10.

Its execution is generally very solid, though I will quibble a bit and say there's a distinct lack of visual contrast between specters and background.  This is especially true in a busy, high-action room, and it is additionally true in cases when jumping as a specter between different traps or world items.  The aiming also takes a bit to get used to, since most items only allow you to aim on the cardinal directions (N/S/E/W), and the delay between possession of a trap, engagement of it, and the actual doing/shooting of whatever it does/shoots I've found hard to nail down.\n\nThis game, like so many games that rely on precision timing, plays much better locally than it does streamed through a Steam Link or other machine - the added network and transcode latency makes controlls noticably more sluggish than when playing locally with a locally attached controller or kb/mouse.\n\nOVerall, a very cool, fun romp.

Key word being local - make sure you have friends to play with. Each playthrough centers around trying to stop whichever boss/Elder God is about to be resurrected. There are three different bosses. You get three attempts per boss - if the Hero fails, it's game over and the God is summoned for the end of the world. Matches are short, 30-60 minutes. You level up both are the Hero and the monster-summoning Wraiths. Each player levels up the monsters they can summon once the Hero reaches the floor exit staircase (which also heals everyone). Once someone reaches level 10, they have to get to the Boss Portal while the Wraiths try to kill him with traps and monsters that they can summon/possess. Once you get to the Boss, the Wraiths possess parts of the boss and try to kill the Hero. \n\nEach successful playthrough unlocks new monsters, weapons, deities to worship (affects stats and which monsters you can summon/upgrade), etc. Wraiths can collect ectoplasm to summon low-level slimes. The Hero has to kill all enemies to escape the room he's in.\n\nGame looks gorgeous. Haven't encountered any technical problems so far. I wonder if the devs plan to implement online play, because local-only really limits the potential.

It's fun, frantic and one of the best multiplayer games I've ever played.\n\nFirst of all, the presentation is unique. It's half glitch-esque, half pixel aesthetic and half lovecraftian horror. The music in this game is foreboding and intense, as well as just being good music, and the monsters all have limbs that contort and move in grotesque ways, which compliment the gameplay well. Speaking of the gameplay... wow.\n\nThe gameplay in this game is phenomenal: a classic top-down combat system mixed with RPG elements. To win the game, you must get to level 10 as the hero, and then fight the boss: if you defeat it, the game ends and you are crowned the winner. What makes the gameplay infinitely replayable is the sheer amount of content on display: 40 unique weapons and 62 unique monsters, multiple status effects, tons of room layouts, and 'gods' that you can worship (or taunt) to give you unique ways to play, such as (slight spoilers) [spoiler] extra health, store discounts and starting with different weapons [/spoiler] .\n\nIt even surprisingly has a great deal of singleplayer substance. If you're looking for a purely singleplayer game, you won't find it here, but there are unique options like endless hero gauntlets (vault challenges) for every monster in the game, shockingly competent AI and 45 achievements, some of which truly test your gaming prowess in interesting ways.\n\nI really only have two minor complaints: firstly, there are only 3 end-game bosses to fight. They are undoubtedly incredibly well animated and oozing with great game design (in fact, the whole game is), but at least having 1 or 2 more, despite the undertaking, could go a long way. Secondly, the game is local multiplayer only. This is a common complaint, and this post sums up the whole situation better than I ever could: http://steamcommunity.com/app/293780/discussions/0/34095051768030848/ , but once again, this could go a long way, and I understand the absence of it.\n\nDespite all this, Crawl is outstanding. It has a great art style, awesome music and phenomenal gameplay that's so good I'm running out of synonyms for 'good'.

I could not with this game however and so it drove me to buy the game mainly out of curiosity. \nNeedless to say this game has surely surpassed my expectations in what I was presented with. I love the feeling of stress that comes with this game as you struggle to be the first to reach victory. I manage in my first playthrough to nearly kill the final boss but, it was not the boss that I had learned to play on. It is definately one of those procedurally  generated-typed games but, that what I love about it. \nThough I love it the only thing that makes the game difficult is dealing with the set up to get a game started with a controler and getting other to play. It is unfortunate that it is local-coop and split screen only but, it isn't something that bothers me too much I like playing the game on my own for the most part. However, it may just be me but have difficulty setting up a game so that it is 3 AI v 1. It only lets me set up just 2 AI but, the introduction allowed for 3. It isn't a big deal but, I have always loved to make a game extra difficult (just a habit). \nI do recomment this game but, I know for some the cost of $14.99 USD is alittle price on a game that you may be taking a chance on.

Most dwindle and become obsolete after a few sessions. But not Crawl.\n\nThe game is very simple and approachable. Few buttons are used, and there is really no tutorial needed.\nAt the very beginning, you choose a deity and watch your pixelated characters drift into madness as you take control and kill your 1 - 3 friends before they murder you. If you survive the slaughter you continue deeper into the dungeon seeking loot, gold, and weapons.\nBut if one of your unhinged friends murder you at the outset, you now take the form or a floating spirit that is unable to physically attack the living friend. But it does not keep you from harming them in other ways. You are able to accumulate orbs that appear on the screen and possess things in the environment in an attempt to harm and eventually kill the living. Collect enough orbs and you can spawn a small, weak blob that you can possess and attack with. Or, just spawn multiple blobs and watch the chaos from the side lines hoping for the best.\nEventually, the hero will enter a room with inverted pentagrams chiseled into the floor, there you can summon a stronger monster that corresponds with your chosen deity.\nAs you and your friends proceed deeper into the dungeon, back-stabbing and killing each other all of the way, you gain stronger weapons and monsters. Becoming more efficient, eventually choosing to enter a boss room and face off against your undead friends who possess a pixelated horror that can be quite challenging. Succeed, and you are crowned the winner of Crawl. But lose, and allow your friends to try the boss fight.\n\n\n[h1] - - - [/h1]\n\n\n[h1] [b] AUDIO [/b] [/h1]\nThe soundtrack fits the game perfectly. It works with the graphic scheme and will keep your heart rate elevated as you play.\n\n[h1] [b] VISUALS [/b] [/h1]\nThe graphics are nostalgic and just plain fun. But if AAA games with next gen graphics are more your speed, you probably won't enjoy this one. It is pretty old-school.\n\n[h1] [b] GAMEPLAY [/b] [/h1]\nThe combat is tight and responsive. Attacks, evades, and movement all act exactly as you would expect with Keyboards, controllers. I have tested Playstation, XBox 1, and USB SNES controllers and it was a blast with all of them.\n\n[h1] [b] STORY [/b] [/h1]\nThere really isn't much of a story. Your characters go insane in a monster infested dungeon, they kill all of their companions, and attempt to best the horrors waiting deep inside.\n\n[h1] I highly recommend this game.

It's possible to pick the pace of the game by including 1-3 AI players on top of the hero you control.\n- Incredible for use as a drinking game (local multiplayer). The game lends itself to unparalleled social/competitive (local multiplayer) gameplay thanks to the (often fast-paced, and frantic) 1v3 chaotic brawling.\n- Narration, sound effects, and music are sensational, giving a strong sense of nostalgia. The narration is kooky as hell, and damn it works well.\n- Game art feels spot-on. Pixelated graphics aren't everyone's cup of tea, though this game makes it work extremely well.\n- Put together perfectly. Every aspect of the game feels as though it was developed with all the other parts of the game in mind. Very polished.\n\nCons (or lack thereof):\n- The game does not (yet) have online multiplayer, however the developers have been very clear in stating that this is one of their primary focuses for addition to the game, moving forward.\n\nSummary:\nDo yourself a favour and grab this game.

The game itself if very fun and innovative. It is designed with local coop in mind and is probably one of the most intelligent party games I have seen. Players try to escape being a lost soul by being the one who deals the death blow to the current live mortal and then beating the boss in order to escape with a body. Players can buy upgrades with gold and upgrade their monsters with wrath.\n\nUpgrading monsters and unlocking new gods to serve are the most fun aspects of crawl. However the gameplay gets tedious fast. With your player and three other ghosts on the screen at the same time all trying to do their own thing, it is VERY easy to lose track of what you can interact with and hard to explore environments. Crawl is too fast paced with players  moving from room to room with little time to properly react.\n\nThe controls are simple and not very inntuitive. The developers should have taken advantage of some other available buttons to add much needed variety. Crawl is a very good idea but needs a much bigger developer in order to get to the fantastic potential it has. Crawl should have been designed around an online multiplayer aspect with chat features in order to get the most out of it. If a developer would to take many of the main concepts of Crawl and couple it with online multiplayer then this would be an instant classic party game. As it stands now Crawl will never be much more than it already is, a party game not aimed at casuals with way too much going on at one time while being surprisingly lacking of content.\n\nGreat if you can pick it up extreamly cheap or have three or four other dedicated friends to play with, but very overpriced.", "timestamp_created": 1509298746, "timestamp_updated": 1509298746, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.397385", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36106495": {"recommendationid": "36106495", "author": {"steamid": "76561197965493217", "num_games_owned": 310, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 233, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509280741}, "language": "english", "review": "Play Now\n1.8 hrs on record\nView your stats\tView global gameplay stats\nWrite a review for Crawl\nPlease describe what you liked or disliked about this game and whether you recommend it to others.\nPlease remember to be polite and follow the Rules and Guidelines.", "timestamp_created": 1509273141, "timestamp_updated": 1509273141, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499775", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36101320": {"recommendationid": "36101320", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058617214", "num_games_owned": 447, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 358, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511397192}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a good-a game-a!", "timestamp_created": 1509259418, "timestamp_updated": 1509259418, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36100912": {"recommendationid": "36100912", "author": {"steamid": "76561198158576462", "num_games_owned": 250, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 541, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 32, "last_played": 1514169451}, "language": "english", "review": "I would highly recomend this game to everyone, its one of the best dungeon \"crawl\"ers i have ever seen. its concept is astonishing and its just soo smooth to play. making my way through all of the deadly traps and pentagons is exhilarating.

You either are the human, trying to escape from a summoning site by killing what you summoned, or you play one of the 3 dead trying to kill the human so that you can continue as the human.This is done by summoning upgradable monsters, slimes or possessing traps and furniture. It seems unfair at first, but after the tutorial you understand. Playing as human is hectic, chaotic and non stop action fun. Playing as ghost is hectic, less chaotic and almost non stop action fun.

No esta en espa\u00f1ol... Como digo siempre: leer o escuchar en otro idioma, solo me estresa mas, independientemente de si conozco dicho idioma o no.\n\nDe todas formas, no es muy necesario conocer ingles, pero creo que se necesitas un poco de nivel, ya que el tutorial te explica como funciona el juego. Ademas, tiene voces en ingles (sin subtitulos, ni en ingles), las cuales a\u00f1aden mas emocion al juego, desafortunadamente, no entiendo ni la mitad de lo que dicen con las voces.\n\nVolviendo a lo que es el juego... Esta muy bien, si bien es cierto que esta hecho para jugarlo con amigos en el mismo PC, SE PUEDE JUGAR A SOLAS PERFECTAMENTE, la IA sabe lo que hace, y hay en algunas partidas me dicho a mi mismo: \"espera, pero si estoy jugando con la IA\", me sorprendio, ya que son muy humanos... En la mayoria de las cosas... Como experiencia personal: una vez mori, y el que me mato, se fue a por la recompensa de mi cuerpo, pero mi cuerpo estaba fuera del mapa (un fallo del juego) intento ir asta el cuerpo, se pego a la pared intentando rodearla, pero no pudo, y tras intentarlo durante 3 segundos, decidio irse. Puede parecer una tonter\u00eda, pero la mayoria de IA que conozco, se quedarian pegadas a dicha pared insistiendo constantemente en meterse por la pared asta tal punto que tienes que cerrar el juego.\n\nEl juego consta de que eres un aventurero o \"Heroe\", que esta atrapado en una mazmorra, pero no puedes escapar, estas con tus compa\u00f1eros y entonces hay una disputa, os mat\u00e1is los unos a los otros (de instakill) y solo queda uno, asi empieza el juego, basicamente empieza con una rapida escaramuza, el primero en matar a todos y sobrevivir, empieza siendo el protagonista. Los demas heroes estan atrapados como espiritus, ya que incluso en la muerte, no pueden escapar (es mas o menos lo que e conseguido traducir yo mismo de las voces en ingles). La tarea del heroe es sencilla, recorrer una mazmorra generada aleatoriamente, que recuerda a cierto juego... The binding of isaac... tambien se les conoce como \"rogue-like\", tiene objetos en la tienda que modifican tus acciones en el juego, como tirar tornados, o invocar un escudo que te proteja la espalda, y armas diferentes, como dagas o espadas pesadas. Puedes ver en todo momento la direccion a la que esta la tienda de la mazmorra, el portal y el piso inferior, asi como las habitaciones sin investigar. Como heroe, tienes que alcanzar el nivel 10, entrar al portal y desafiar al jefe, al derrotarlo, conseguiras escapar vivo de la mazmorra, si no... Quedaras perdido para siempre y un horrendo mal se alzara al mundo.\n\nAl empezar varios jugadores en el juego, obviamente no podran ser todos el heroe, asi que al terminar la disputa del principio del juego, donde se matan los jugadores, los unos a otros... Quedaras en fantasma y pensareis... Ser un fantasma tiene que ser un rollo, \u00a1NO LO ES!, creo que es muy divertido, ademas, es necesario en el juego, ya que los fantasmas son al mismo tiempo, los enemigos de la mazmorra. Cuando empiezas una partida, te dan para seleccionar un grupo de tres monstruos (van como en packs, no puedes elegir monstruos individualmente). Cada vez que el heroe sube de nivel, los fantasmas suben su \"IRA\" y con eso conviertes a tus monstruos en seres mas poderosos, eso al final de cada planta de la mazmorra. Cada jugador tiene su propia \"IRA\" y su propio nivel, asi como armas y habilidades que este compre. Ademas de invocar monstruos, los fantasmas pueden poseer objetos y trampas de la mazmorra, pero la camara siempre estara en la sala del heroe y los fantasmas tambien. Es divertidisimo ser fantasma, y ir alternando entre fantasma y heroe me encanta.\n\nCuando acaba el juego, te dan recomensas, nuevos monstruos, evoluciones de estos, armas, etc... La IA tiene varias dificultades y puedes decidir cuantas IA hay en una partida.\n\nLo malo obviamente es... Esta en ingles... Jajaja no no no. No me molesta tanto (era broma). Lo realmente malo es que NO puede jugarse ONLINE y este juego ganar\u00eda mucho en poder jugarse online.", "timestamp_created": 1508432478, "timestamp_updated": 1511451699, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503603", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35843607": {"recommendationid": "35843607", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059900843", "num_games_owned": 342, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 84, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508996655}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm sure you get the picture by now.

Every time the human breaks scenery, it creates ectoplasm for the ghosts.  Therefore the human wouldn't want to break scenery, except that ghosts can pick up unbroken scenery and throw it at him.  To keep the ghosts in check, scenery doesn't yield ectoplasm when broken by a ghost.

The gameplay kicks butt and is incredibly fun, the monsters and traps are delightful, and you can clock hours of play on it.  One thing I really appretiated was the very balanced system. The most levels that your opponents get as a human, the stronger your monsters get, as you collect spendable Wrath points from each of their levels. This ensures that, if one player is especially dominating as the human, the weakest player is allowed to catch up by giving them the strongest monster advantage, without weakening the other players.  The most recent add-on of scrolls has also been incredibly good, allowing you to steal items from other players. Items like these ensure that even the strongest players are not 100% safe and means that there is always a chance at redemption. This is a great game!\n\nP.S.

Fun on a bun. Bun bun fun fun barrel with friends.\n\n\nPractice with the bots, and then invite your friends over to crush them until they catch up.\n\nOr spend time analyzing the game to take down your friends strategically:\n\nAt the beginning of the game, the human character is far more powerful than the monsters. The monsters have to run, hide, and perform various shenanigans. Without good strategy, the monsters get killed and the human character can get super far ahead at the beginning. But as a direct response to the human character getting ahead, the monsters become stronger. The balance shifts to the reverse; the monsters are now the powerful ones, and the human character now has to be more creative, and inevitably, they will succumb to the gradual loss of health that is the life of a rogue-liker. Now, a less powerful human player takes the wheel, and they will most likely get killed by the most powerful monster (the weakest human player), gradually balancing the game while leaning towards the more skilled players.\n\n\nThere are two things that are wrong with this. One is that there is exactly one strategy that works at a certain given time; you either run and hide, or charge relentlessly, and it has an obvious curve; the less powerful you are, the more sneaky you should be. No other strategy will lead you to success. \n\nAnother is that it isn't always the most powerful monster that kills the player; sometimes, like in other games, there are people who sneak in for the last hit without doing much of the damage at all. This means that the one that camps far away and sneaks in a blow when the player is at low health is the one that gets the reward.\n\n\nTherefore, in order to kill the human and become the human (which gives you the lead), you have to stay behind the lines of other monsters until the human is at low health, at which point you act according to your level of power; if you're powerful, charge right at them to get the last hit in, and if you're a lower level monster, shoot at them with everything you have while staying out of the line of fire.\n\nThe meta can be advanced from here, but this is all you need to invite your friends over and crush them until they catch up.\n\nMore meta - The killing blow is the killing blow, no matter how small. This means that quantity over quality is what you want for your monsters. Anything with damage-over-time effects will be more likely to get you human status.\n\nIt's also not a good idea to kill the human early on - there are still lots of other monsters; you'll be cannon fodder. Wait for someone else to take the bait and then reap.\n\nNow invite your friends over, so that you can crush them. Then you should make a lot of tables and graphs, and then invite your friends over, so that you can crush them.\n\n\nPoint and laugh at your family as they struggle helplessly to kill your ever-stronger player character.

NOW FIGHT! Starting off, everyone is a one shot kill, so these few delicate moments could change the tide of the entire game. So, being the last one alive means you're the first one to roam the dungeon.\n\nEveryone else follows you as a ghost. These ghost can spawn monsters, set off traps, and throw furniture at you. Playing as the ghosts is one of the more fun parts of the game, but fighting the monsters and staying one step ahead of your friends as the hero, is just as fun.\n\nHealth is rare and expensive when found in stores, so every drop of health counts, making it all the more devastating when your friends kill you with a crate... But, it's all in good fun... Right? RIGHT?!\n\nThe upgrade system is fun. The stronger the hero gets, the stronger he plays, but the stronger the hero gets, the more powerful all of the ghosts get. This power can be used to upgrade the monsters. Also, I gotta love the simplistic weapon system that just tells you if it's better or not, without having to pull out a calculator. Oh, the spells are also pretty cool, though some seem a bit unbalanced, this seems intentional and I love it.\n\nOh! And the fact that little orbs the ghosts collect go all around the room and the orbs can be used to spawn slimes! It's fun and a great time waster while the hero changes weapons in the shop.\n\nI also like how every time you beat the game you unlock evolutions for monsters, or new sets to start off with. It's reminiscent of Pokemon and I always want to see what new monstrosities I get to kill my friends with!\n\nMy biggest problem in this game is that it truly takes competitive people to play the way it's meant to be played. You have to truly want to kill the hero, which leads to some problems for some of your friends who might just want to help you. So, maybe add in some sort of All Players VS AI mode?\n\nYou might have noticed that I've basically only talked about playing this with friends, there is AI to play against, but this is the kind of game that is truly meant to be played with friends, which is why I don't have many hours on it... *insert crying*\n\nAlso, online multiplayer... Get on it.\n\n[h1]Graphics:[/h1]\n\nAh, from the font to the characters it screams \"new school retro\" and I love it.\n\nThe spells are vivid, the monsters are horrid, and best of all... THE GUI ISN'T A PIECE OF GARBAGE!\n\nNot much else to say. I love it!\n\n[h1]Sound:[/h1]\n\nMuch like the graphics, they're retro and I don't have much to say about them.\n\nEverything sounds like it should, the background music works well, but if you know me, the only reason I put in a \"Sound\" section is if something is wrong.\n\nWell, what's wrong.\n\nGah!\n\nIt's the narrorator!\n\nI don't enjoy it. It seems meaningless and the voice actor just isn't right for this game, not to mention narration itself doesn't seem like it fits in the game.\n\nApparently the narrator was added in the release, but in none of the betas. Meaning this seems to me like a bit of an afterthought. This one of my only complaints with the game and it could easily been made a nonissue with one option in the settings, but that doesn't seem to be important to anyone else... Oh, well.\n\nAnyways other than that, sound is good.\n\n[h1]Other Recommendations:[/h1]\n\nWell, a few come to mind, but none of them really feel the way Crawl does.\n\nCastle Crashers for the gameplay, Darkest Dungeon for the theme, and... Well, that's about it. Crawl does it's own thing.\n\n[h1]Pricing:[/h1]\n\nThis game is worth it's $15 price tag.

When you first start just the design and idea is pretty cool, but as you play and start to learn what everything does and how it works, there comes a depth of planning when playing against friends. The bore comes from the limited set pieces, levels are randomly generated but have a pretty limited amount of props and hazards, so when you play against the computer it very quickly just feels like \"Same old, same old\". With friends you never know what the other players might do, the computer has a pretty standard process of playing the game. The weapons, items, bosses and levels are all kind of randomly rolled out, but from a pretty limited stock. There's only 2 or 3 bosses, a handful of weapons and items and as I said pretty limited level sets. What makes all this fun is human players, randomizing how it is used and doing unexpected things with it. The computer fails to really be inventive, duh, it's a computer.

Um dos jogadores \u00e9 o her\u00f3i enquanto todos os outros tentam mat\u00e1-lo com armadilhas, totems que soltam fogo e - o mais importante e divertido - monstros invocados. O jogo tem todo um equil\u00edbrio bem trabalhado em como cada jogador ganha experi\u00eancia quando \u00e9 humano e dinheiro quanto \u00e9 um dos fantasmas, al\u00e9m do sistema de upgrade dos seus monstros. \n\nMas o mais importante aqui \u00e9 que [b]a mec\u00e2nica de se juntar com amigos para matar o her\u00f3i da vez funciona, e \u00e9 muito divertida[/b]. Voc\u00ea vai se encontrar diversas vezes se juntando com os outros fantasmas para bolar jeitos mirabolantes de encurralar e matar o her\u00f3i, enquanto ainda tenta dar o \u00faltimo ataque antes dos outros fantasmas para ter sua vez como her\u00f3i.\n\n[u][b]Visual[/b][/u]\n\nEu sou suspeito pra falar, mas sou apaixonado por pixel art. Isso dito, a [b]arte de Crawl \u00e9 especialmente bonita por conta de termos pixels grande e sem contorno, mas que se movem de forma fl\u00faida[/b]. O contraste entre a fluidez do jogo e os grandes pixels pode incomodar alguns por dificultar o entendimento de alguns objetos, mas eu pessoalmente gosto muito da est\u00e9tica.\n\nOs menus s\u00e3o todos retr\u00f4s e simulam os de jogos cooperativos das antigas. Voc\u00ea s\u00f3 pode inserir 3 caracteres como seu nome e a tela at\u00e9 tem alguns ocasionais [i]glitches[/i] que imitam os consoles mais antigos.\n\n[u][b]M\u00fasica[/b][/u]\n\nEsta fica dif\u00edcil de criticar. [b]A trilha sonora retr\u00f4 encaixa perfeitamente no estilo do jogo[/b], colaborando bastante com a experi\u00eancia geral.\n\n[u][b]Coment\u00e1rios Finais[/b][/u]\n\n[b]Crawl \u00e9 um \u00f3timo jogo para sentar no sof\u00e1 e disputar com os amigos[/b] - o bom e velho cooperativo-destruidor-de-amizades. Alguns jogadores reclamam da falta de uma modalidade online, mas eu acredito que o jogo brilha mesmo quando jogamos com amigos no mesmo ambiente (apesar de ter tamb\u00e9m um modo [i]single-player[/i]).\n\nMeu \u00fanico ponto negativo \u00e9 que [b]o jogo poderia ter mais conte\u00fado[/b]. Como as rodadas s\u00e3o r\u00e1pidas, espera-se que o jogo se mantenha divertido depois de v\u00e1rias partidas como em jogos do g\u00eanero como Binding of Isaac, Enter the Gungeon e outros, que possuem grande variedade de armas, [i]power-ups[/i], inimigos e chef\u00f5es. Crawl ainda tem uma quantidade reduzida de op\u00e7\u00f5es de armas e inimigos, mas como os desenvolvedores s\u00e3o bastante ativos h\u00e1 a possibilidade que novo conte\u00fado seja adicionado.\n\n[b]Ainda assim, o saldo final \u00e9 de um jogo bastante divertido para jogar com os amigos.[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1499873409, "timestamp_updated": 1499873476, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33481372": {"recommendationid": "33481372", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047957742", "num_games_owned": 233, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 938, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511834647}, "language": "english", "review": "It's pretty awesome.

It's a great game to get together with some friends and provides plenty of entertainment.\nPROS:\n-Great variety in weapons and monsters (Seriously, every game is different as you use different strategies to overcome your opponents)\n-The graphics remind me of Arcade Machines, and I love Arcade Machines.\n-Gameplay is amazing, and it's easy to understand the controls for your monsters in a very short amount of time\n-Simple controls: You have move, regular attack, and special attack.\n-Wide selection of gods, all of which give different bonuses and monster lineups. (S'hrim is p good)\n-Progression system where more items, traps, gods, and monsters are unlocked as you play.\n-Glub.\n-Capability to control the final boss in an epic battle against the human.\n-Boobs. (This may be a pro or con, depending on who you are, so I'm putting it for both)\nCONS:\n-No online play.\n-Using the keyboard sucks, especially when the other players have controllers.\n-Only 3 bosses, which can get very repetetive. (Eventually, the journey leading up to the boss is more fun than the boss itself)\n-The Spikewurm. There's nothing really that wrong with it. It's just that I am incapable of killing it.\n-Boobs. (This may be a pro or con, depending on who you are, so I'm putting it for both)\n\nOverall, Crawl is a great game and I highly recommend it if you have some local friends to play with, or are OK with facing the bots.

I've had trouble trying to discern things on the screen, because there had been so much going on.\nAs the game starts, you can choose a deity to worship. All of which give bonuses and a little set of 3 different, upgradable monsters, which you'll control when you die.\nYou get a lot of things to play around with. As the good guy, you get tons of weapons and some spells, each weapon has their own moveset. It's a shame that most weapons look the same, the khopesh doesn't have its sickle shape, it just looks like a straight sword.\nBad guys get to control the various obstacles in the dungeons, this is the part of the game which hooked me. It's like every enemy that recklessly beelined to hurt the immortal hero (you) in other games, suddenly grew a brain and started using actual strategies.\n\nOf course you aren't forced to play with others, you can play alone with bots. The AI, from what I've experienced in hard difficulty, is actually very proficient and ruthless at the game.

I've been inclined to beg, borrow and steal this game 1000 times over and then tell anyone about the game who would listen. I am more than honored however to give my money and have convinced others to do the same. \n\nThe best way to describe the game is competitive 2d zelda, where monsters and traps have never been more devious. Never have I felt more like a fiercely hateful of life spectre than in this game. This game's driving principle is that there is no rest for the wicked. Every monster is entertaining in their own right and you will learn your preferred paths and monster tiers. \n\nPlaying the \"Guy\" is a treat in its own because of the game's absolutely sublime controls and execution. Strutting into a virgin store after styling and stomping asses to stack up on discount charms, stat boosting potions and then just to vacuum up anything that looks like it could be useful to someone else after you inevitably die is the prize for any would be hero on a new floor. There's always an evolving meta to each game because each player is distinct. Are you getting zoned out by web, acid, ice or slimes who consistently spawn in under the cover of a hungry trap? Get a ranged weapon or spell. Eating a lot of poison and fire and seriously regretting it? Cover your ass with as many floating magical shields as you can and buy all the status effect countering rings. Stack levels and equipment until you are a juggernaut then rip and tear.\n\nThe game is a salt mine that has generated heated debate into 4AM, broken senses of identity and simply exhausted others who didn't have the wherewithal to maintain the sinister Samsara to the end of the game.

One player is the hero, who attempts to kill monsters, get gold, buy items and defeat the boss to escape the dungeons. The other players? They play the monsters. The gimmick is that when one of the monster players kills the adventurer, they swap roles and thus everyone keeps going around in circles until someone is finally strong enough to kill the boss.\n\nIn many games this might mean the monsters are just downtime between turns getting to be the hero, but not so in Crawl. The monster gameplay is quite in depth with each player being able to level up their stable of hand picked monsters, activate traps and so on.

player(s) to play as both the hero and the villain. The game has a pretty balanced battle system that allows both sides of gameplay to feel like they're on the same level. The game has a cool collection of monsters with its own set of attacks as well as designs that really make the game stand out, the game also allows the human to play very differently with stat decreases and increases and different weapon types that each have different effects. While I do believe that this is a fantastic game, I feel like its missing quite a lot of aspects that would make it a masterpiece. Firstly, while the game is quite fun as a local game, this game is missing out because of its exclusion of a multiplayer online feature. Another thing I believe that the game should have is more bosses. The game uses the same three bosses and after fighting [spoiler]Kourok[/spoiler] for the 20th time it starts to get a little repetitive, the addition of more bosses and monsters would drastically spice up the gameplay. All in all, I believe Crawl is a pretty good game and while I do hope they add online- multiplayer, I still recommend this to those that want to play a fun dungeon crawler with friends close by.", "timestamp_created": 1495903051, "timestamp_updated": 1495903051, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31977050": {"recommendationid": "31977050", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058742922", "num_games_owned": 305, "num_reviews": 63, "playtime_forever": 805, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492820644}, "language": "english", "review": "An awesome local multiplayer game that you will not regret buying", "timestamp_created": 1495816331, "timestamp_updated": 1495816331, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31976107": {"recommendationid": "31976107", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019244812", "num_games_owned": 290, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 384, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497711561}, "language": "english", "review": "If you have friends to play this with locally its a blast.", "timestamp_created": 1495813648, "timestamp_updated": 1495813648, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31964591": {"recommendationid": "31964591", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086126262", "num_games_owned": 112, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 179, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495233213}, "language": "english", "review": "Me and my Roomates got into a huge fight while playing this game which almost made all of us want to move out.", "timestamp_created": 1495770513, "timestamp_updated": 1495770513, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31963974": {"recommendationid": "31963974", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995238758", "num_games_owned": 349, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 287, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495850598}, "language": "english", "review": "I love how this game plays.

Crawl has been in early access for a few years and it might be one of the shining gems to come out of the Early Access void. \n\nCrawl is supposed to be a party game where you or one of your friends control the hero and wanders the dungeon alone while the others try to control one of the monsters and try to kill you and halt your progress as the hero so that they can take your place and vice versa. \n\nFrom the start Crawl puts your friends and you in a gladiatorial arena battle where you hammer each other to death before one of you emerges from the rubble caused by the commotion to wander into the dungeons. The other people then become ghosts who can control monsters of varying powers and try to kill the hero at every step he takes. Even here it is a race to get the last hit on the hero so that you can become the hero.\n\n It is very frustrating to reduce a hero down to low health by yourself only to see someone else come and take the kill. It does put a lot of pressure on the monsters and they have to be on their guard at every given moment to check out their surroundings.  The other players do not need to become a monster to harm the hero as they can possess things like traps and spring them up at the exact moment to get the kill or throw random objects to hurt the hero. \n\nCrawl also gives the player who has been the hero the least times the most powerful monsters to control so the game never feels unfair most of the time unless someone from your party of your monsters take the kill and it is a rage fest all over again. When a hero reaches Level 10, they can activate a sacrificial portal which allows them to face Giant Boss creatures in a bid to escape his fate and the cursed dungeon.\n\n The other players control the Boss\u2019s different organs in an almost Power Rangers Megazord kind of way. This great loop of gameplay of Crawl where you keep dying and coming back as the hero makes Crawl one of the best couch co op games in recent memory.\n\nAs the hero Crawl feels like a typical dungeon crawler RPG where you hack, slash, loot, dodge and earn XP to level up. There are a variety of weapons and spells for the player to use as the Hero and while there are you usual inane weapons which don\u2019t feel anywhere close to some others, there is quite some interesting loot present in Crawl. The game as the hero plays like you would expect but it is the great unknown of the pleothera of monsters waiting behind the next door that is the great draw of Crawl.\n\n As the ghost you have a lot of options to choose from a variety of monsters who have different tiers which require Wraith to unlock more powerful monsters. The monsters are quite obviously different from each other in very unique ways and while it might seem unfair, it gives the lowliest of players the strongest of monsters to have his own time in the glory.\n\nThe AI for solo play in Crawl is competent but nowhere near as fun as you will have with your friends. It is completely worth a try for its single play but do make a reminder to invite your friends over later for this one. There is no online play to speak of and considering the gameplay, it is probably for the best too. Crawl feels incredibly polished and the game runs really smooth at any given instance of time.\n\n[h1]Visuals[/h1]\n\nAs far as pixelated art goes, Crawl takes the cake. It has a gorgeous art style which somehow makes even the blood and gore on the screen pretty neat. This is a game famous for spawning countless GIF\u2019s and there are more to come from here. Some of the monster designs are truly incredible and some of them never fail to make you laugh. The game looks incredibly good and there is nothing quite like it.\n\n[h1]Sound[/h1]\n\nCrawl has an incredible sound design which compliments its gameplay and visual aesthetics really well. The sound effects are solid and set the mood perfectly. There is little voice acting from the narrator but whatever there is, it is done really well.\n\n[h1]Overall[/h1]\n\nCrawl is one of the best couch co op game to have ever graced my screen and there is no two way about it. It is one of the best examples of early access being done right and there is nothing quite like a Crawl party when it really gets going, Crawl works completely fine as a single player game too and there is a lot of content here to justify the price tag but you should definitely get Crawl if you want a solid game to enjoy with your friends.\n\n[h1]Rating: 95/100[/h1]\n\n\nThis review was brought to you by SaveorQuit.

It recently left early access, entering the fully released stage. The game\u2019s idea is really original: four players (either bots or humans) are playing at the same time. One of them gets the role of dungeon explorer, going through the dungeon. Other take the roles of ghosts, who can spawn monsters or possess the traps across the rooms. If someone manages to kill the dungeon explorer, he takes his role, while recently deceased player becomes a ghost. The player who manages to get level 10 and kill the dungeon boss wins.\n\n[h1]The Good[/h1]\n\u2022\tReally innovative and fun gameplay: there\u2019s also no downtime for anyone, because all players influence the game in a way. It\u2019s like telling a story from two different points of view\n\u2022\tLots of content and variety: different bosses, monsters, weapons and items. As you play more games, you get more unlocks, diversifying the randomized gameplay even further\n\u2022\tAI is really good\n\u2022\tThe game has its own style: the pixel art is well aligned and fits the theme well\n\n[h1]The Bad[/h1]\n\u2022\tA bit of a snowballing tend to happen. If one player levels up while playing explorer, other players (ghosts) are getting stronger monsters. Technically, that tends to even out the disadvantages (weaker players have stronger monsters -> statistically they tend to kill explorer more and take its role) as the game progresses. But if weaker player gets the role of explorer \u2013 he still has to fight the strong monsters of at least two other ghosts which often won\u2019t be in his favor. During the midgame this gap is felt the most, but then it evens out if the game drags on a bit. That\u2019s really the only drawback I can name.\n\u2022\tNo online multiplayer: the game could really benefit from it.\n\u2022\tAlso, minor thing, but I could not switch active display on my machine (could not move the game to second screen). The option to do this is there, but it did not work if I changed it.\n\n[h1]Summary[/h1]\nThe game is good in singleplayer, because AI can use the surroundings well and both control and combat the monsters skillfully. However, Crawl shines brightest when played with friends: the hot-cold relationship that turns upside down when someone takes control of the explorer (and the old foe, in turn, becomes somewhat your friend) makes up for a lot of funny and exciting moments. The content unlocks also makes it really replayable. Overall, it\u2019s a solid game with original premise and I highly recommend it.", "timestamp_created": 1492892988, "timestamp_updated": 1493021313, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519960", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31290786": {"recommendationid": "31290786", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084359321", "num_games_owned": 651, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 161, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492834725}, "language": "french", "review": "Version longue : https://cabinetdechaologie.wordpress.com/seances/douzieme-seance/crawl-petits-monstres-entre-amis/\n\nVersion courte : une super id\u00e9e, une r\u00e9alisation au niveau, limit\u00e9 par son mode multijoueur local uniquement mais un party-game de qualit\u00e9.", "timestamp_created": 1492844811, "timestamp_updated": 1492844811, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504681", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31274883": {"recommendationid": "31274883", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074896991", "num_games_owned": 78, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 266, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507303053}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10, even if you dont have friends to play with", "timestamp_created": 1492780778, "timestamp_updated": 1492780778, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494861", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31273193": {"recommendationid": "31273193", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999407414", "num_games_owned": 232, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 768, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1447360477}, "language": "french", "review": "Foncez !

Dies motiviert auch noch dazu weiter zu spielen.\n\nIch gebe dem Spiel 7 /10 Punkten, weil da noch viel mehr geht und weil man derzeit Freunde einladen muss damit man das ganze Spielgef\u00fchl von Crawl hat.\n\nPs: habe es bis jetzt ca 5 Stunden gespielt, eine Stunde alleine und ca 4 Stunden mit Freunde.", "timestamp_created": 1492685624, "timestamp_updated": 1492686022, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31248361": {"recommendationid": "31248361", "author": {"steamid": "76561198107263685", "num_games_owned": 103, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 453, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492735142}, "language": "spanish", "review": "El juego esta entretenido. tiene buenos pixel arts como podran ver. soundtrack bueno. le doy un 8/10", "timestamp_created": 1492655102, "timestamp_updated": 1492655102, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497512", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31244732": {"recommendationid": "31244732", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066122921", "num_games_owned": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1641, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503705523}, "language": "english", "review": "This is THE most fun couch Co-Op game I've ever played.

The hero is more powerful than the monsters, so the non-hero players are forced to co-operate to whittle down his health, but once he's at low health that spirit of co-operation goes out the window and everyone is trying to land the final blow for themselves. This game's balance is extremely tight, barring a few exceptions (bows are the worst starting weapon in the game by far) and it's always a blast to play since the games aren't too long.\n\nThe mid-game is where Crawl truly shines, as the monster players have gained enough power to defeat the hero and he has yet to gain the powerful late-game equipment that would allow him to defeat such threats. At this point the game becomes a race, where you want to grab enough upgrades to be able to take on the bosses, but not spend so much time in the dungeon that you die and lose your spot as hero.\n\nMy only real complaint about Crawl is that I wish there were just a couple more bosses, as for most of the early access period there were only two, and now they have come to full release adding on just one last boss. The boss fights are fun, but with such a limited pool they get old fast, with optimal attack patterns that are easy to counter as the hero.", "timestamp_created": 1491936328, "timestamp_updated": 1491936328, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.560872", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31082705": {"recommendationid": "31082705", "author": {"steamid": "76561198329625435", "num_games_owned": 2053, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 168, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491930698}, "language": "schinese", "review": "[b]\u7b80\u8bc4[/b]\n\u8f7b\u5ea6Roguelike\u751f\u5b58\u5927\u4e71\u6597\n\n[b]\u73a9\u6cd5[/b]\n\u968f\u673a\u5730\u57ce\uff08\u697c\u5c42\uff0c\u542b\u82e5\u5e72\u623f\u95f4\uff09\n\u6700\u59274\u540d\u73a9\u5bb6\uff08\u62161\u73a9\u5bb6+3AI\uff09\n\u5f53\u524d\u73a9\u5bb6\uff08\u4eba\u578b\uff09\u4f1a\u53d7\u5230\u5176\u4f59\u4e09\u540d\u73a9\u5bb6\uff08\u5e7d\u7075\uff09\u7684\u653b\u51fb\n\u5e7d\u7075\u53ef\u5229\u7528\u623f\u95f4\u91cc\u7684\u9677\u9631\u9053\u5177\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u53ec\u5524\u53ef\u4ee5\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u602a\u7269\uff08\u5f00\u59cb\u6e38\u620f\u524d\u9009\u62e9\u5176\u4e2d\u4e09\u79cd\uff09\n\u5f53\u524d\u73a9\u5bb6\u88ab\u96c6\u706b\u63a8\u5012\u4e4b\u540e\uff0c\u5316\u4e3a\u5e7d\u7075\uff0c\u4e0b\u4e00\u987a\u4f4d\u7684\u5e7d\u7075\u5f97\u4ee5\u5316\u4e3a\u4eba\u578b\n\u4e0a\u4e00\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6301\u7eed\u5faa\u73af\n\u76f4\u5230\u6709\u73a9\u5bb6\u51fb\u8d25BOSS\u6216\u8005\u67d0\u73a9\u5bb6\u7d2f\u79ef\u88abBOSS\u51fb\u5012\u4e09\u6b21\uff08\u540e\u8005\u4e0d\u592a\u786e\u5b9a\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u5173\u7ed3\u7b97\nBOSS\u4e5f\u53ef\u4ee5\u88ab\u5e7d\u7075\u73a9\u5bb6\u6240\u63a7\u5236\n\u6bcf\u4e00\u5c42\u5730\u57ce\u7686\u6709\u5546\u5e97\uff0c\u5927\u698240\u79cd\u6b66\u5668\uff0c60\u79cd\u88ab\u52a8\u9053\u5177\uff0c10\u79cd\u4e3b\u52a8\u9053\u5177\uff08\u95ea\u907f\uff0c\u51b2\u649e\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u8fd8\u6709\u5347\u7ea7\u7528\u7684\u836f\u74f6\uff08\u5148\u624b\u8fdb\u5546\u5e97\u7684\u836f\u74f6\u5168\u4e70\u8d70\uff0c\u7f8e\u6ecb\u6ecb\uff09\n\u6bcf\u4e00\u5c42\u7ed3\u7b97\u65f6\u90fd\u80fd\u5347\u7ea7\u5e7d\u7075\u5f62\u6001\u53ef\u4ee5\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u602a\u7269\uff0c\u79cd\u7c7b\u7e41\u591a\uff0860+\uff1f\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\uff09\n\u53e6\u6709\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u9650\u5b9a\u578b\u6311\u6218\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u662f\u7537\u4eba\u5c31\u6d3b\u4e00\u767e\u5c42\u7cfb\u5217\u62ef\u6551\u624b\u6b8bQAQ\n\n[b]\u8bc4\u4ef7[/b]\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [td]\u6218\u6597\uff0c\u624b\u611f\u8d85\u597d\u6ee1\u5206\u4e0d\u8c22[/td]\n        [td]10/10[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]\u97f3\u4e50[/td]\n        [td]7/10[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]\u753b\u9762[/td]\n        [td]7/10[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]\u5355\u4eba\u6d41\u7a0b[/td]\n        [td]7/10[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]\u57fa\u53cb\u4e92\u6495[/td]\n        [td]100/10[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]AI\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u5e7d\u7075\u6643\u5f97\u6211\u6709\u70b9\u773c\u6655 [/td]\n        [td]?/?[/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]", "timestamp_created": 1491933361, "timestamp_updated": 1491933855, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.595960", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31082487": {"recommendationid": "31082487", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049443845", "num_games_owned": 657, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1310, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500131123}, "language": "english", "review": "fucking love it", "timestamp_created": 1491932614, "timestamp_updated": 1491932614, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.396134", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31081584": {"recommendationid": "31081584", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998274943", "num_games_owned": 183, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1440, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505615369}, "language": "english", "review": "Best 4 player local game.

Ainsi, les positions ne sont pas fig\u00e9s et les changements de r\u00f4le s'effectuent reguli\u00e8rement. Les fant\u00f4mes peuvent prendre le contr\u00f4le de monstre bien s\u00fbr mais aussi de statues redoutables, de pi\u00e8ges fourbes ou m\u00eame de mimic (coffre). Les mimics sont d'ailleurs redoutables mais ne poss\u00e8dent qu'une vie, il faut donc en prendre possession discr\u00e8tement et attendre sagement que l'humain s'approche pour le d\u00e9vorer.\n\nParfois on fait \u00e9quipe entre fant\u00f4mes mais cela ne dure jamais, faut bien lui donner le coup de gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 ce satan\u00e9 humain. On peut faire \u00e9voluer ces monstres entre chaque \u00e9tage, les points d'\u00e9volutions que l'on gagne correspondent au nombre de niveau que les humains ont gagn\u00e9 pendant l'\u00e9tage. Ainsi les monstres restent toujours \u00e0 un niveau suffisant pour pouvoir tuer l'humain.\n\nUne fois le niveau 10 atteint, un humain peut tenter de combattre le boss qui sera control\u00e9 par les trois autres joueurs en m\u00eame temps. \u00c7a donne des moments bien loufoques ou le boss fait n'importe quoi parce que personne ne se coordonne. Heureusement, tuer le boss est assez complexe si on fait un minimum \u00e9quipe, pour r\u00e9ussir l'humain devra avoir acheter de l'\u0092\u00e9quipement puissant au marchand de chaque \u00e9tage. Ils sont vari\u00e9s et les armes achet\u00e9es offre parfois des capacit\u00e9s surprenantes. \n\nBien s\u00fbr Crawl n'est pas parfait, ses contr\u00f4les peu pr\u00e9cis dus \u00e0 son style arcade pourront en d\u00e9router certains mais on s'habitue vite. \n\n[b]Apr\u00e8s plus d'une quinzaine de partie (pendant l'acc\u00e8s anticip\u00e9) je n'ai pas encore tout vue et chaque partie qui dure environ 30-40 min a r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 rester surprenante.

Although I think this game is really awesome I sure hope there are a few things I hope they add to the game either with the release or I hope they continue to develope it afterwards.\n\nA list of my concerns:\n[list] \n[*] The current game has only 2 bosses, from what I've seen with the full release on 04/11/17 that there should be at least one more, I hope there is more than 3 bosses it would be nice to have around 10 for a vast diversity and challange.\n\n[*] Some of the elements in the game are not really used all that much, especially the ice element, which there is an item that helps a human character when they are afflicted by this element. To my knowledge there are only two ways to inflict an icy affect on a human character and that is with one of the more advanced monsters and with one of the two current bosses.\n\n[*] A huge concern is that they are going to keep the same floor pattern as they have now. What I mean by this is that everytime you advanced through the dungeon onto another floor, its just another randomly generated floor. It would be nice to have themed floors, like an icy floor zone, or acid, spikes, fire, death, blood, etc. the list could go on. \n\n[*] This game very well could end up feeling like an unfinished game if some care isn't considered and implemented. It almost feels that the developers are tired of working on this project and just want to release it and move onto the next project. I may be wrong about this, but either way it will still be an amazing game!\n[/list]\n\n     I don't know what they will all be adding to the game when it is finally out of early acces, but I sure hope the developers don't stop developing this game besides the occasional hotfix or small update since it really needs so much more.

The human needs to reach level 10, gaining levels by defeating monsters, then enter the boss room and defeat the boss to win the game. However, every time the player gains a level, making them stronger, the other players gain \"wrath\", a currency they can use to upgrade one of their three possible monsters. Each upgrade tier has two choices, offering a wealth of diversity, and indeed mayhem when all of the effects start flying. With the wrath mechanic those who are not playing as the human get progressively more powerful until they have a good chance of getting the kill and reclaiming their humanity once more. \n\nThe mechanics of play are simple to understand; one button attacks and another uses your \"special\", a choice of whatever spell that you choose to buy from the blacksmith, gold permitting.  We had two regular gamers and two non regular gamers and everyone was able to compete out fo the gate. Tutorialising is extremely clever in Crawl, other than the buttons you are introduced to each of the ideas of the game through play; for example one of the bosses offers the chance to utilise a healer mid battle so before you enter the boss room he appears and gives you a glimpse of how it works. It is an extremely clever and intuitive process. Similarly, when you enter a new room items that you can interact with flash. \n\nThe meta game is really quite engaging, too. At the start of each run you choose a deity to worship; this determines the three monsters you are able to use during the run and also a passive bonus. After each run you unlock new deities to worship, new weapons and spells to buy from the blacksmith, new monsters to play as and even new traps to utilise in the dungeons. All of this is to say that as you play more, the options increase and the game becomes even more varied on each play through. \n\nIn summary, I can't praise Crawl enough. I thoroughly enjoyed every tantalising moment of play, every death throe and every victory. For anyone that enjoys gathering some friends and playing together, both in competition and in co-operation, you can't do any better than Crawl. \n\n\n************************************************************\nFeedback for the Devs:\nFirst, thank you for this amazing game!\n\nSecond, in my humble opinion, I think a few elements could be tweaked to improve the awesomeness:\nThe monster with the shield special; I think then cooldown is too short when coupled with his impressive speed.\nPlayer colours; red and orange can become confused in the heat of play.\nLoss of control; occassionally it is hard to determine why a player cannot attack (such as when on a pool).\n\nLastly, a few ideas we had...\nGame modes! Such as on death rotating to the next player in line, rather than on kill. Or a human's health ticks down, ensuring that each turn as the human is finite and the rotation is more likely.\n\nThank you again, for the wonderful Crawl. \n***************************************************************", "timestamp_created": 1488107052, "timestamp_updated": 1488112996, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514777", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30175236": {"recommendationid": "30175236", "author": {"steamid": "76561198260538515", "num_games_owned": 14, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 117, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487509432}, "language": "german", "review": "Ich liebe es!

If you like local multiplayer games, this is pretty much a must!\n\nAt first glance, this looked like a funny concept that would be amusing for a game or two. Little did I realize how addicting this game can be!\n\nPros:\n+Very simple controls (only two buttons)\n+Tons of unlocks and reasons to grind. There's a very large amount of content to unlock through continued gameplay, and what feels like virtually unlimited, Mugen-esque mod potential.\n+ AI bots - you can play this alone with AI bots tagging in for other players. No need for friends to enjoy it!\n+ Excellent balance system - Your hero levels up by killing monsters, and your monsters level up by other players' heroes leveling up... meaning in one player is dominating, everyone else gets stronger monsters to try and beat them back down\n+ Out-of-game challenges - Practice with monsters between games and see what you've unlocked\n+ Large variety of spells and equipment - Get awesome powers and cool weapons with both magic abilities and even cursed gear\n+ Cool boss battle concept - Try to win the game with 1vAll boss fights\n\nCons (with suggestions): \n- The game has the potential to drag - With random gear in the shop, a hero can get powerful quickly or struggle to survive a few rooms in a row. Bosses can be rough without good gear, so there's no easy way to predict if a single playthrough will last 30 minutes or 90. There could probably be some sort of adjustable gold/XP/item-power/wrath settings that would allow players to customize for faster or slower playthroughs.\n- Only two buttons - Your ghosts have an Inhabit/Attack button, and a Special Attack/Exit button. Many a fight has been thrown at a critical moment by checking for a special attack only to basically forfeit the fight by leaving a monster/object. Just adding a third button for Inhabit/Exit would solve this\n- No online play - I really, really hope this is something they look into. I would buy a half dozen copies of this in a heartbeat if they added this feature.\n- Endgame item shopping is often a buyout - As you get to deeper levels, gold accumulates quickly and being the character alive when you enter the item shop usually turns into a shopping spree as you buyout most of the floor. It can be rough to keep your hero alive in endgame without proper gear. The game has a great mechanic of letting a new player teleport to the item shop after reviving his hero AND clearing the room, but that often doesn't help much if you're the second or third person to get to the shop that floor. And if you're undergeared, you probably won't live to the next floor/shop. I should stress, though... while this is an annoyance, it IS NOT game-breakingly bad by any means. This could be fixed with some sort of minimum item system per-player per-floor.\n\nNeutral notes:\no The game is 1-4 players, and the mood of it changes a lot based on how many there are. 1v1 is a game of slow whittling and constant annoyance. Monster fights are sniping and kiting and trying to break them down over the course of rooms. 4-player games are basically royal rumbles every-other room, and the hero is swarmed with monsters, dies, is replaced by another player's hero who now still has to deal with the leftovers. Control often changes hands twice in a single room. 3-players is my favorite balance so far. Some sort of optional monster handicap setting could add more variety (option to boost in 1v1 for easier turnover, option to weaken in 4-player to make surviving longer easier)\n", "timestamp_created": 1487530801, "timestamp_updated": 1487530801, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30026338": {"recommendationid": "30026338", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027104941", "num_games_owned": 128, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1397, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505358969}, "language": "english", "review": "This is the best couch game out of all possible couch games. \n\nFor context: I play a great deal of couch games with a great variety of people, and what I've learned is that it can be a *challenge* to keep everybody having fun throughout the night. It's one thing to play games with a bunch of Melee pros, or a gaggle of drunk newbies, but what happens when you put them together? Either you play gang beasts, and the tryhards are bored to death, or you put on Samurai Gunn and the poor boy/girlfriend who got roped in gets their ass handed to them for the rest of the night. It seems like there's always someone who isn't having fun. \n\nBut not with Crawl.\n\nThe terrific basis of Crawl is that losing is *fun*. And the worse you are, the more fun it is. The more the tryhard in your group levels up, the bigger, uglier and more powerful your monsters are. Getting stomped for the first half hour? That's ok, now you have a *giant chicken ogre* to stomp that ****er with. It also serves as an auto-balancing system, so that even the worst player in the group has a chance for an epic comeback. \n\nBut on the tryhard side, there's a host of options and optimization to sink your teeth into, as well as plenty of things you can pick up to make things more interesting. When one of our guys felt he was rampaging a little too hard, he got the item that gave him massively discounted items in exchange for randomly being turned into a frog - and spent the remainder of the game alternating between a raging fireball of spells and getting pulverized as a helpless amphibian. Taunt the gods to make your victory even sweeter through self-imposed hard-mode. It's a blast.\n\nPlus, the art's great. The gameplay is great. The variety and depth of content is great. The replayability is great. The dramatic lovecraft voiceovers at the start of every game are really, really great. \n\nThere are a lot of good couch games this competes with.

As he struggles to his feet he notices three of his best friends making the same discovery in the room.  Suddenly, as if a product of his own confusion, a voice shouts in from above telling him that only one of them will survive.  Scrambling to find something useful on the ground, he realized they must have heard that same voice!  Brought back to his feet by the safety of a knife, he notices there is only one left and his back is turned.  The knife is plunged into his back and he immediately falls to his knees with him in dismay.  Regretful thoughts and sobbing are interrupted by the voice again, \u201cGet up, death is no means to an end in this vile place,\u201d and to his uneasy comfort, his friends were floating above him in spirit.\n\tThe mechanics of this game have created an incredibly balanced gameplay that is easy for anyone to get into, built on top of a wonderfully themed visual and auditory experience.  Now begins the intrepid narrative through the ever-changing procedural dungeons of Crawl.  This unique four-player split-screen game by the Australian studio Powerhoof starts you off against all your friends (or surprisingly intelligent AI) in a one-hit-to-kill brawl to decide who the hero will be first.  When you are not the hero, you are a ghost that may float around the map getting into whatever he or she may like.  They could inhabit furniture and throw it, they could command traps to aim and activate, they could interact with pictures and holes in the walls, and of course, summon and inhabit upgradable monsters on pentagrams.  Once a monster, or even a trap or furniture kills the hero, that ghost will take his place leading the exploration.  The goal in this game is to reach level 10 and challenge the player-controlled boss.  \n\tThe cohesive design of the auditory and visual aspects of this game are really the biggest things that set it apart from others.  They had decided on a very low-resolution pixel art type of sprite style, which being paired with the chip-tune style of music creates a beautiful modern take on this classic style.  The title screen and name screen even say \u201cInsert Coin\u201d instead of \u201cPress Start\u201d and only allow you to enter three-character names like an old arcade box.  Many tiny details have been added to the game, proving how much time and dedication it must have taken to build such a piece.  From random seeming pixel glitches on the menu screen paired with auditory glitches, to rich item descriptions, to screen shake.  There is even a narrator at the beginning of rounds that tells the story slightly different every time.  If you are the type of person that is overwhelmed by this art style, which I will admit is pretty common when you first start playing, I urge you to play for a while and really give the game a good shot.\n\tEveryone I have showed this game to seems a little overwhelmed and intimidated at first, just due to the amount of things happening on screen at all times.  The presumption that you will not be good at this game at first, however, is one that could not be further from the truth.  Even if you cannot kill the hero and lead the charge, your monsters will continue to level up as the current hero does.  Inversely, if you are very good at this game and spend the whole time playing as the hero you may have good weapons, but your monsters will be weak and it will be significantly harder to become the hero again.  \nGiven the multiplayer mechanics, the balancing aspects of this game seemed to have just come together inherently.  It feels so very natural to play, and often times, will create some very unexpected outcomes.  The bosses require the ghost players to work together and coordinate their attacks; otherwise it will be all too easy for the hero.  \n\n\n*********************Warning: Spoilers*************************\nOne boss has an arm that fires sludge that will slow down and damage the hero.  The other arm fires bubbles that will trap the hero and make the final boss weapon much easier to hit.  The last weapon is an enormous eye laser that moves very slowly, but if the other teammates have done their jobs correctly, it will make short work of any level hero.  The other boss is a three-headed elemental dragon that has somewhat similar mechanics, but requires a different strategy.  There is an NPC in this boss fight that heals the player, which means the dragons best bet is to stay between the hero and the health.  As interesting and fun as these bosses are, more bosses would add a lot more variety to each dungeon adding much more replay value to this game.\n********************End Spoilers**************************\n  \n\tAfter playing \u201cCrawl\u201d with lots of friends it has easily found its way into my top five games.  The gameplay is chaotic, and challenging, and terribly competitive.  The overall style and design of the game makes it feel like a complete new artistic world to explore.  However, as full and entertaining as this game is, it is only in early access. It is not even finished yet, so go on steam and watch their wonderfully interesting trailers and support the designers at Powerhoof by getting your copy.\n\nTL;DR\n\nAwesome Game, go buy it and beat up your friends", "timestamp_created": 1486067270, "timestamp_updated": 1487897443, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.600000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29626373": {"recommendationid": "29626373", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039901373", "num_games_owned": 76, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 167, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501638281}, "language": "english", "review": "What a great experience!\n\nReally fun and kinda of adticve.

The other guys tries to kill that main character, either by controlling the enviroment or buy summing slimes and monsters that can be upgrated. They can even control the boss to kill the main one.

What I really like, you always unlock some new items etc. after a run, sometimes you don't think, they won't change too much, but after the next run you are deeply satisfied.\n\nOK: the gameplay: you and your friend/enemies try to get enough experience to defeat a big monster boss. What makes the game interesting: there is only one player that plays a living human being, the other ones are ghosts that can possess different objects/traps in rooms to kill the human or conjure monsters, at certain points. When the human dies, one of the others, a real player or the computer, can have the body of the human. You fight from floor to floor, earning gold, to buy interesting weapons and other upgrades at shops, one shop each floor.\n\nI really love the controls, at first they felt clumsy and out of touch, but this is part oft the charme of the game, that it is rather difficult to aim et cetera: just brillant! Because everything in the game fits to each other. I love the retro graphics/pixel art/the music/sound, everything. \n\nOnly one thing would be a negative aspect for me: there are far too less different end-bosses: there are only two of them.\nAnd that makes the end-fights a little bit boring and repetive.

With every creature the hero kills, that player receives experience and can level up. Once a player reaches level 10, they can go through a portal and fight the boss, and if successful, win the match.\n\nAfter every playthrough you unlock more traps, monsters, and bosses.\n\nVerdict:\n\nGreat party game to play together with friends on the couch, and a great way to end friendships :)", "timestamp_created": 1483920703, "timestamp_updated": 1483920703, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29126412": {"recommendationid": "29126412", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031380196", "num_games_owned": 148, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1556, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495852103}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best couch party games I've had the fortune of playing.

Also when you first get the game you should have 4 monsters instead of 3 to start with so if you bought it to play with 3 other friends everyone could have a different character to use. overall i really liked this game and it is very promising and i highly reccomend it to anyone. one of the best early access games ive personally ever played!", "timestamp_created": 1483513084, "timestamp_updated": 1483513084, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "28991300": {"recommendationid": "28991300", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999119758", "num_games_owned": 80, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 187, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488833763}, "language": "german", "review": "I really like the art, but the rest sucks.", "timestamp_created": 1483486828, "timestamp_updated": 1483486828, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.402820", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "28991038": {"recommendationid": "28991038", "author": {"steamid": "76561198274145903", "num_games_owned": 47, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1105, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497260226}, "language": "english", "review": "After playing with Crawl for a few hours I was torn between to sides. I personally think the game is amazing with friends, a simple 2 button battle system with in depth items, traps and layouts. What really helps improve this games lastability is the fact that you are able to slowly unlock new monsters, weapons and parts of the game.\n\nWhat has to be my favorite part of this game is that it gets updtated so frequently I often find myself coming back to it just to see whats new.\n\nThe main offput of this game is that it is MADE for playing with friends. If you dont its just a CRAWL to the end of each stage fighting against, pretty decent AI. In the end this confinement  combined with the fact that it only works with local multiplayer is the main offput.

Roguelike[/h1]\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nThe gameplay is akin to The Binding of Isaac, you collect items in shops to further inhance your character whilst exploring a randomly generated dungeon filled with monsters, the difference being that it's a cometitive multiplayer experience, where you your friends or even cpus (which play near identically to a human) are ghosts fighting over a single human body, by killing the player in the human body you gain control of it and can upgrade yourself (each player has their own seperate pool of items).\n\nBut how exactly do you kill the human as a ghost, well as a ghost you're able to temporarely control one of three monsters (the monsters you get depend on which god you pick), when you damage and get damaged by the human you gain blood which will turn into gold if you become human, if the human levels up you gain wrath which lets you make your monsters evolve after someone ends the floor, these mechanics allow someone to easily jump infront which leads to a constant intensity in the gameplay.\n\nThe end goal is to defeat the boss monster, the boss monster can only be fought by a level 10 human, the boss monster is controlled by your opponets, whoever defeats the boss monster wins, if you lose you are still a human (you just have very low health), however there are only 3 total attempts shared between all players, whoever loses on the final attempt is the loser and the game ends.\n\n[h1]Visuals[/h1]\n\nThis game has beautiful pixel art graphics which invokes a feeling of arcade cabinets from the 90's, every sprite is well done and fits the same theme, while there are flashes that might pose a risk to someone who is prone to epileptic seizures.\n\n[h1]Audio[/h1]\n\nThe sound effects are very well done, all fitting the same theme.\n\nThe music is amazing, it's very energetic but not overly so which is very fitting for the gameplay.\n\n[h1]Performance[/h1]\n\nA potato could run this game with no slow down, it's barely intensive.\n\n[h1]Price Efficiency[/h1]\n\nThis game will last you at least 3 action packed hours just by your self, you'll get an extra 1 or 2 hours from playing with friends, but if you play one run every now and then by yourself it will start to add up over time, I've got 13 hours just from playing this one or two runs and then setting it down, for $9.99 (usd) that's an amazing deal.\n\n[h1]Scoring[/h1]\n\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [th]Category[/th]\n        [th]Score[/th]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Gameplay[/td]\n        [td]18/20[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n

with this game. I highly recommend this game to any arcade horror fans.\n\nPros:\n- Really fun and original gameplay, even against bots.\n- Cool pixel art graphics.\n- Awesome monsters to level up and play as.\n- Great and diverse character animations.\n- The narrator's voice is awesome.\n- Good soundtrack.\n- Plenty of unlocks and character progression.\n- Monster battle challenge mode is fun.\n\nCons:\n- No online multiplayer. \n\nIn summary, even playing single player against bots, this game is a blast. Every run is different. The bots are very intelligent and challenging. Every aspect of this game is spot on. I would rate this game 9/10.

I fully recommend buying. And if you're off-put by the lack of online multiplayer, don't be. Because playing with the AIs is basically the same experience you'd get from online multiplayer, except no lag, no cheaters, and more consistantly fun to play with enemies.\n\nThe game is amazing about balance, and it makes it virtually impossible for one person to fall behind and end up not having a good time. Here's how it works:\nThere's always one person who plays as the \"Hero\", with the other three (or other two or other one) playing as \"Ghosts\" who summon and inhabit monsters, as well as using traps and throwing objects at the player. Whoever kills the current Hero becomes the Hero, with the dead one becoming a Ghost. When the Hero levels up, each of the Ghosts gains 5 wrath. At the end of each floor, players can spend wrath to level up the monsters that they summon during the level. So if you spent most of the last floor as a Hero, you'll be stronger in that aspect, whereas your monsters will be struggling (it's generally better to have a strong human though, as that's how you actually win the game). So even if you're doing terribly and haven't killed the Hero once, you still have a decent shot since you will have the strongest monsters in the game, and so the best chance of becoming the next Hero. Ghosts also gain gold passively through their interactions with the Hero (although the Hero gets more), so weak Heroes can still afford to upgrade their gear once they get to a shop.\n\nOverall this game is just wonderfully balanced, both by the premise as a whole, and the amazing level of detail the developers have gone into to ensure that the scales never tip too far in one direction. You'll also never find a more attentive and responsive development team, just looking at their forums or their community page alone would be enough for me to buy this game, regardless of the amazing fun that it is.", "timestamp_created": 1480186633, "timestamp_updated": 1480186633, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "27705516": {"recommendationid": "27705516", "author": {"steamid": "76561198101348632", "num_games_owned": 52, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1483, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509484070}, "language": "english", "review": "Crawl is an asymetrical multiplayer action roguelike.\n\nThis game is for you if:\n-You think you are the best roguelike player in existance\n-You and your friends want something new to play\n-You like games that are in EA\n-You like pixel graphics\n     =and cool soundtracks\n\nMy Experience:\nI like the fact that this game can be easily competative and easily run from many laptops.

As an indie game, it will be money well spent (privded you have people to play with for some fantastic couch co-op). Get it, its great.\n\nI own a lot of shared/split-screen games. I tend to organize a bunch of team sports, and pre-drinking is mandatory. To this end, having simple to play, local co-op games is a must for some good rowdy entertainemt. Crawl is simple to play (moderately hard to master). There are only two buttons, attack and special but the hook is that it is dynamic 3v1 set up. A 'human' player competes against three 'ghosts' to gain enough levels to be the one that challenges the boss. Ghosts inhabit monsters to kill the 'human'. The one that lands the deadly blow becomes 'human'. As 'human' players level, ghosts get currency to in turn level up their mosters. Thus, if you can't get a kill on a human and everyone levels around you, you will have more to spen on leveling monsters, ergo a higher chance of getting the kill. As monsters do damage to humans they gain currency they can use if they become human in a shop to increase their effectiveness. Once someone reaches enough power to challenge a boss, the 3 ghots comibine to controll that boss to fight. Overall, the game design is solid, unique, and super fun. If there are no monsters to inhabit, ghost characters can controll various traps and jump into items to harrass the 'human'.\n\nI've had this game for a long time and the developers are still providing updates with more monster evolutions, more items to purchas in the shop, and more trap dynamics. The only even remotely (possibly)negative thing is they have yet to add to the roster of end game bosses (currently there are only 2).\n\nWhile the overall this is a simple game there is a slight learning curve (mainly what are the monster attack/specials, possible human specials). There is progression (unlocking monster evolves/items), but it is pretty quick. Super casual players may be turned off by this, but overall, whenever I bust this game out, response is always positive.", "timestamp_created": 1480024073, "timestamp_updated": 1495832341, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27313340": {"recommendationid": "27313340", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044851986", "num_games_owned": 109, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 343, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510084316}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing gameplay, fast paced and a real joy playing 4 person local multiplayer.

AHORA!\n\n[h1] gameplay: [/h1] los controles de crawl pueden ser descritos con dos palabras, simples y funcionales, con mando de xbox 360 (que personalemte recomiendo jugarlo con mando) en nuestra forma de humano o monstruo en caso de los fantasmas nos moveremos con la palanca izquierda, atacaremos con A y con B ejecutaremos nuestra habilidad especial, y en nuestra forma ectoplasmatica podremos poseer objetos con A y con B invocaremos a un slime compa\u00f1ero, unos controles simples pero al mismo tiempo intuitivos y faciles de deducir\n\n[h1] banda sonora: [/h1] el soundtrack de crawl es bastante simple tambien, unas tonadas en 8 bits que van bien con los graficos y la ambientacion, no sobresalen por nada en particular pero funcionan bien y para mi eso es mas que suficiente\n\n[h1] mecanica: [/h1] esta vez, pasamos de cosas simples a uno de los juegos con la mecanica mas enrredada pero mas divertida con la que me he topado (despues de move or die claro) explique ya que al inicio tendremos que matar a nuestros 3 compa\u00f1eros y que el sobreviviente sera perseguido por los fantasmas de sus compa\u00f1eros caidos sedientos de venganza e intentaran matarlo a toda costa, para hacerlo podran poseer objetos como vasijas, carros de mina e incluso trampas, cada sierto tiempo (y con cada sierto tiempo me refiero a casi todo el tiempo) nos encontraremos con habitaciones con pentagramas en el suelo, si un fantasma activa el pentagrama se convertira en un monstruo y podra luchar directamente con el jugador con vida, el fantasma que mate al humano se convierte en el humano y le tocara a el sobrevivir, aqui viene lo realmente complicado, el jugador que controle al humano ganara oro conforme vaya avanzando sala por sala, este oro lo podra gastar en tiendas para mejorar su equipo y volverse mas fuerte, mientras que los fantasmas acumulan furia conforme el humano va progresando y ellos fallando al intentar matarlo, esta furia la podran usar al final de cada nivel para mejorar a las bestias en las que te puedes convertir siendo fantasma, el problema es que el humano no acumula furia, por lo que si llevas un buen progreso y no te has muerto, no podras mejorar a tus bestias y cuando mueras y te toque a ti ser fantasma, vas a sufrir, y eso... duele\n\n[h1] contenido: [/h1] he decidido dejar esto para el final ya que es un tema que quiero hablar de manera seria, el juego esta en early acces (para los novatos, el juego aun no esta del todo terminado) por lo que aun falta contenido por agregar, pero con lo que he podido comprobar, le falta mucho contenido, digo, cuanto duraras con un juego que cuenta con dos jefes que se repiten todo el tiempo, armas que tienen diferencias peque\u00f1as entre si, diferentes clases pero que aun asi muchas de ellas comparten transformaciones y un dise\u00f1o de niveles que en cuanto te acostumbras se vuelve predecible? la verdad es que yo amo este juego, pero agradeceria que se pusieran a trabajar en nuevos jefes, nuevas clases, nuevas armas y si es posible, un modo multijugador online ya que le hace mucha falta (teniendo en cuenta que es un party game, ya veras tu) a lo que voy es que le falta contenido pero teniendo en cuenta que aun esta en desarrollo, confio en que cuendo este terminado, sera un juego rebosante de contenido\n\n[h1] conclucion: [/h1] en definitiva crawl es uno de esos juegos que te encuentras poco en steam, un juego que no busca ser especial, pasarse con sus graficos o estafar a la gente, de hecho es todo o contrario, es un juego que busca entretener y ya, es simple en muchos aspectos pero roza la perfeccion en otros, y con amigos dejarlo pasar no es una opcion\n\n[h1] nota final: [/h1] le doy a crawl un 8/10, puede que cuendo este terminado mi nota para este juego cambie, pero por ahora, basandome en el contenido del juego actual y el factor diversion, yo creo que esta nota es mas que justa, recomendadisimo por si buscas algo diferente y entretenido o para jugar con amigos", "timestamp_created": 1479962765, "timestamp_updated": 1479962765, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501235", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "27015228": {"recommendationid": "27015228", "author": {"steamid": "76561197966539262", "num_games_owned": 457, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 119, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491747484}, "language": "english", "review": "I've been playing Crawl since you were all in your jimmy jams, having played the original game jam prototypes from way back yonder.

One player is always the human, trying to stay alive and gain levels by fighting monsters. The monsters, however, are controlled by your \"friends\" - many rooms have pentagrams on the floor, which, when approached by a ghost player, allow the summoning of a ghastly creature from the depths. As the player character gains strength, the monster players gain \"wrath\" - which in turn allows them to upgrade their monsters to a new, unique form. This way, the 1-3 players that are not currently the human constantly gain strength, which usually means it's just a matter of time until the human falls...\n\nAnd when he does, the \"ghost\" that struck the final blow trades places with the human, and gains XP and gold in his stead. The goal is to reach level 10 and challenge the boss of the dungeon. If you beat him, you win. If you lose, there are 2 more tries ANY player has to get out. Else, everyone loses. After a game you unlock more items to buy, more dungeon objects to encounter and use (at your own risk..) and more deities. \n\nAt the beginning of each game, each player picks a deity, which will 1) determine what base monsters / upgrade paths are available to that player and 2) what passive ability / starting item the human form of that player has. There is a lot more diversity to this game than initially meets the eye, which is great. Dungeons are also procedually genereated, the intro varies a lot- it really tries hard not to get old anytime soon.\n\nAnd on that it succeeds in my opinion. If you have any opportunity to get friends in on this - do it. You wont regret it. There are simple yet interesting combat mechanics to master, and every game unfolds differently, depending on deities and what the shop has to offer on each stage. It's really good. As for the early access, it's hardly noticable - I actually only remebered because of the frequent updates.", "timestamp_created": 1478172548, "timestamp_updated": 1478172548, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "26393391": {"recommendationid": "26393391", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023668918", "num_games_owned": 95, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1277, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499087682}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game.

I bought it yesterday because the idea of the game seemed amazingly interesting! (It's amazing!) and it truly is super interesting. The amount of detail and creativity put into this game blows my mind. Just the concept alone is cool. Then you unlock things as you play and there are new bosses and so much more. It adds a whole nother level of greatness. My only complaint is if you play this game with 4 players then only three tries are given (total or between all characters) to fight the boss. This makes it more grindy due to the fact that everyone else is controlling the boss and it's a 3v1. I love the challenge but maybe there could be an option for how many tries you get so it doesn't get so grindy. Anyways I love the game. It's fantastic and I recommend it to everyone.

Controls are basically L-stick to move/aim, A to shoot/slash, B to dodge/special move.\n\n\nThe goal for every player is the same, kill the boss after reaching lvl10 in human form, to be released from the dungeon. A sudden-death at the start determines the first ''runner'' to enter the dungeon in human form, your slaughtered companions souls steadily haunting your every step to kill you and take away your humanity for themselves i.e. their try at defeating the dungeon. The dungeon in itself is harmless, but every trap and contraption can be used by the ghosts of the other players to make your run a living bullethell. Furthermore each room contains a differing amount of pentagrams which can be used as a ghost to spawn into a monster, each with its own unique moveset. These creeps can be lvled after every floor, levels in human form of enemy player determine your evolution points. Human Form spends picked up cash to get new weapons, artifacts, moves etc. each weapon with its own moveset, each ability with its own uses. After a human form hits lvl 10 they can enter the boss portal on every floor to have one of the three tries at defeating the boss, problem is, the boss is also controlled by the enemy players, making this whole game a really competitive experience best enjoyed if all players have the gitgud mentality.\n\nSoundtrack is amazing, fits the game perfect, really raw dark 8bit sounds whose rhythm still keeps you looped into the game.\nGraphics can be seen on screens.\n\nOnly missing feature is online-multiplayer, in other aspects this is a game I support in every way and would buy again just to support development and show my gratitude for creating this piece of art. \nDefinitely worth more than 10bucks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\np.s. gitgud, dodge moves only, abuse the MoI, take the bow, crush the boss", "timestamp_created": 1471955012, "timestamp_updated": 1471955309, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25079295": {"recommendationid": "25079295", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072403109", "num_games_owned": 239, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 917, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501073541}, "language": "english", "review": "I bought this way back when it very first came out for I think it was 69p and to watch this game evolve over this period of time is amazing.

game\n+ It's a 2D game\n+ It has some nice pixel art \n+ It is 1 of the best pixel games ever \n+ It is replayable\n+ You need the unlock new charachters and weapons and Items and objects so you never run out of fun until you have collected everything  how can you unlock stuf : you need the play the game.\n+ It is one hack of a great dungeon crawler game one of the best \n+ It has some fantastic RPG elements \n+ It has some roguelike elements \n+ It is a fantasie game \n+ It is one of its kind there are not a lot of games like this one\n+ It Is a beautiful pixel game and indie game\n+ You can play this with bots or friends \n+ It is a easy the learn skill game \n+ It is great the play with a  keyboard and with a controler\n+ The game has challeges \n+ It is a great balanced game\n+ It has a great story teller \n+ you kill each other at the start of the game.\nto decide who will  be the hero.that is great no hassle just let your sword speak for you.\n+ It gives a 90e feeling \n+ a monster has 4 forms and you can go in the 2 ways with that too\n+ The levels changes everytime \n+ It has some great music\n+ The blood and gore is fantastic\n\n> What I dont like about this game \n\n- You cant play online \n- Easy bots are just broken and stupid \n- the one eye flying cyclops plays like the human bull\n- one of the starting groep monsters starts with an op blood ring \n- the bosses are the easy \n-  Hyperdash is OP\n> Brain octopus\n> 3 headed dragon \n- there are not a lot of bosses only 2 on the moment\n- you can not shoot around with the one eyed Cyclops so your fucked When You miss and his second attack is somekind of dash that's just bullshit I hope they change that in return perhaps some kind of blue ball that does a lot of damage on tough would be cool as second attack with a cooldown of course.\n- You can spawn kill the first monster that spawns in the game the ghost are not that fast so the hero is almost always near the monsters spawn point.\n- a skeleton cant bleed \n- the bots will always run back too the shop the are not gone teleport \n\n= I rate It a 8/10 screw you i'm out of this dungeon \n\n= Buy the game when It is 8 euro or lower\n\n= For who is this: this game is for the dungeon crawler lover or the pixel/indie gamer that likes a game with some RPG\\roguelike elements and has some friends the play the game with \n\n+ Tips for the developers \n>  you can not shoot around with the one eyed Cyclops so your fucked When You miss and his second attack is somekind of dash that's just bullshit I hope they change that in return perhaps some kind of blue ball that does a lot of damage on tough would be cool as second attack with a cooldown of course.\n> Give the spider a poison attack \n> don't spawn a Hyperdash scrol in the first 6 levels \n> fix the easy AI\n> fix the 3 headed dragon if the hero walks agains him the monster can not hit him, mabye give the dragon a fly abilitie the fly away from the monster and stop healing the player 2 times is enough.\n> fix the bleeding skeleton \n> create an exchange system if you buy something in the shop then your old object will go  back in that shop so the other players/bots have something the choose from\n> All this game needs is online play, and I'll play it for the rest of my life.\n> more bosses plz", "timestamp_created": 1468173686, "timestamp_updated": 1468177012,

Mit jedem Heldentod wird ein anderer Spieler zum Helden und versucht ebenfalls das Dungeon zu durchqueren. Das Ziel ist es, seinen Charakter auf ein gutes Level mit guter Ausr\u00fcstung zu bringen um den Endboss zu besiegen, welcher ebenfalls von den Mitspielern kontrolliert wird.  Die Steuerung ist derweil immer sehr einfach gehalten und sollte kein Problem f\u00fcr Leute die das Spiel das erste Mal spielen darstellen.

With Lovecraftian horror and 8-bit pixel art, a couch competitive 3v1 dungeon crawler emerges from the depths.\n\n[h1]How it works[/h1]\n\nI've never played a competitive game with this mechanic before. A brief matchup at the beginning of each game determines who the \"human\" player is, and who the \"monster\" players are. The human player traverses the dungeon, looking for the stairs to the next level. The monster players control spirits who float around the room with the ability to possess traps, spawn slimes, and summon controllable demons for the purpose of killing the human player. If the human player dies, the monster player who landed the fatal blow assumes the role of the human hero while the former human player joins the ranks of the ghosts. The amount of monsters you kill as the human hero determines who wins the game, with a levelling system that gives boosts to overall health. Monster earn a separate class of EXP which can be used to upgrade their demons to even more powerful monstrosities. Human players also have the opportunity starting at level 10 to fight a challenging dungeon boss picked at random.\n\n[h1]What it needs[/h1]\n\nThere should be a system to upgrade peak monsters' base attributes, though, as a handicap for less experienced players. I already love the balancing system though. Also, at this point, the music is very limited and gets pretty repetitive. Finally, attack controls feel a little gummy and could use work before you stop walking away from the game with bloody thumbs.\n\n[h1]In conclusion[/h1]\n\nBuy this game if you love dungeon crawlers, rogue-lites, and are looking for a very new twist on a classic genre to challenge your friends with.

That is saying a lot, given how many of those types of games are on Steam alone.\n\nUnlike many of those games, Crawl is played out in a king of the hill style, with one player controlling the hero, and the other three controlling monsters and traps. Kill the hero: become him. This is a mechanic I had never seen before and am thouroughly impressed with how well it was implemented. It draws you in. The fights and tension between players is genuine, and when you find yourself shouting with excitement... or resentment, without even realizing it, that is a very good thing.\n\nThe art is amazing. As someone who appreciates pixel art style, especially the retro, arcade-type pixelation, the art and animation immediately stood out to me. Very fluid and well done but at the same time still able to hold that nostalgic factor.\n\nThe soundtrack, while limited, shines where it is implemented. A very omnious feeling throughout, and the tracks change appropriately depending on certain events such as a player approaching victory or entering a boss fight.\n\nThe gameplay is well balanced and thought out, characters and monsters can be upgraded, and the rubber-banding is appropriate. Players can come back from any defecit at any point in the game.\n\n[h1]Overall Opinion[/h1]\n\nThe game is a must buy in my opinion. It is best played with friends, but I have enjoyed several hours of playtime with the AI, which can give you a run for your money. Updates are still on the horizon at the time of this review, showing the devs really care about this game and its success. Their forum on their website posts upcoming updates for the game and gives players the oppurtunity to give feedback, which is a welcome stand-out from a lot of other developers.\n\nWith more content on the horizon, Crawl is shaping up to be a very promising game. As of now even, it is definitely a complete, polished game worthy of many hours of playtime.", "timestamp_created": 1466796062, "timestamp_updated": 1466796062, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.679408", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23760347": {"recommendationid": "23760347", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003033413", "num_games_owned": 540, "num_reviews": 149, "playtime_forever": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1466783982}, "language": "english", "review": "A pretty awesome party game with good atmosphere, okay graphics and music and fast paced combat.\nGreat if you have 1-3 friends to play with (against) not so great if you prefer to play alone.

Mass Effect is an excellent single-player example, Populous is one of the best God games out there; FTL, the standard for roguelikes. So when it comes to multiplayer games that are not only fun, challenging, and fresh but that allow you to drop a hot mess on your buddy's head, no game is better suited than Crawl. \n\nBut how to best describe a game that effortlessly packs together arcade style multiplayer alongside RPG friendly player progression and item usage? Well if I had to use a single word to do so, I'd say something along the lines of...bananas.\n\nThis game is fucking bananas.\n\nFirst off, the premise. You and up to four other players (bots are also an option) are tasked with defeating the final boss in a dungeon crawler style series of levels that contain all manner of hazards from fire-spewing torches to Zelda style porcupine bricks that careen from one side of the map to the next. At any given moment, one player is the human in search of the end of the dungeon while the rest are either floating apparitions that collect globs of ectoplasmic goo to use as a weapon later on or to possess vile aberrations; each of which possess' it's own unique approach to dispatching the lone human paragon. \n\nMonster progression is tiered and each tree provides a different approach and selection of satanic beasts you will be able to choose from. This includes, but is not limited to, Cthulhu (+3 Lovecraft boner), Skeletor's misogynistic cousin, and a barfing carp or, as I have come to know it as, \"Barfamander.\"\n\nYup, it's sort of like Army of Darkness got drunk and had a sloppy fuck with a desperate Pokemon. \n\nYou'll spend a great deal of time possessing traps as you chisel away at the human in play in the hopes that, by killing them in a Shogun Assassin style arterial splash of blood, you will land the final blow and thus become the human until the same fate befalls you. It's a fun give-and-take that means that anyone can end up being the winner regardless of points or skill level (although the latter certainly factors in).\n\nFun Steam based additions have been somewhat regular and made the title a real gem as far as replay and for the creepily glitched out visuals and sound that operate like an NES on meth. Got a few bucks to spare with the buddies you love to hate most? \n\nGet your Crawl on. \n\n\nCHECK OUT THE WHOLE REVIEW AT ETHNOGRAPHIX:\nNOTHING BUT GAMING CULTURE AND KATS!", "timestamp_created": 1465645328, "timestamp_updated": 1465645328, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23497577": {"recommendationid": "23497577", "author": {"steamid": "76561197988286414", "num_games_owned": 90, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2473, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489960887}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm a sucker for retro graphics, I'm also a sucker for retro graphics with and arcade, RPG type feel.

Of all of the roguelike, couch co-op indie games out there, Crawl has to be my favourite. The atmosphere of the game is just creepy enough to send the willies up newcomers, not to mention the new intro cutscenes narrated by the magnificent Old Shrimpeyes. I don't know what that man eats, drinks or starves himself of to get that kind of voice, but whatever it is, I want it.\nIntro and Atmosphere aside, Crawl is just a boatload of fun to play. I picked up the Steam Link recently and said box of goodness has proven itself to be quite good at processing these pixel-style games. It's situated in my living room, so I of course went on to have a real couch co-op experience with a few mates which consisted mainly of ghostly noises and violent screaming. The graphics are great, especially when running at 60fps as you get to watch the current human shifting fearfully from hall to hall before being set upon by rats, spiders and goblin grasshopper thingies, all of which are controlled by either bots or the people sitting next to you.\nThe best part is, if you haven't been human for a while, you gain Wrath every time the lucky fellow levels up, which in turn allows you to evolve your goblin grasshopper thingy into a rock-lobbing giant. This system of EXP for the living and Wrath for the dead makes the game a lot fairer and keeps things interesting in a long runthrough.\nOverall, I'd recommend Crawl for anyone hankering for some old fashioned jolly cooperation; I can't remember what I bought it for because I was a pre-release funder, but whatever it costs now, it's worth it!", "timestamp_created": 1465225827, "timestamp_updated": 1465225983, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.604688", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23399492": {"recommendationid": "23399492", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084480398", "num_games_owned": 77, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 491, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490300347}, "language": "english", "review": "After playing with a group of friends, this is how my best friend described the game:\n\"F*CKING KILLSTEALER\nF*CK F*CK F*CK THIS WEAPON\nF*CKING LAVA F*CKS\nF*CKING FISH\nMOTHERF*CKIN SPELL BOOKS\nMOTHERF*CKIN SOUL BOW\nF*CKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK\"\n\nAs you can clearly see this game is very enjoyable!

This dungeoncrawler lets you fight against your friends. Your friends are actually the enemy, not the AI as it usually would be in a coop game. At first, all the players fight against each other and the last one alive gets to \"crawl\" the dungeon while his friends try killing him as all sorts of mobs. The variation is really surprising, you play a fish, a undead, a samurai and so much more. Those are the opponents of the human player.

Also, playing against three of your friends as a hero is a pretty big challenge considering how strong some monsters are, so going first  AI on hard mode can be fun to play against since their aim is pretty on point and can make for a great challenge at some times, since I have seem them occassionally stick to walls and just die there. \nPlaying by yourself isn't exactly the most amount of fun and having to unlock new monsters and items can be considered a both positive and negative, since it gives you something to work for, but at the same time it would be nice to have everything to play with your friends from the start. Also, unlocking everything seems like it would take less than 9 hours of gameplay, so unlocking items and monsters is not really a big grind, which helps.\nI think if they added a few more bosses and balanced a few of the weak monsters, then this game would be 10/10 when playing with friends.\n\nOverall,\nif you got friends and want to have fun killing each other, then this is a game you should buy.", "timestamp_created": 1463817049, "timestamp_updated": 1463817049, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23111210": {"recommendationid": "23111210", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005166460", "num_games_owned": 2308, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 52, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1463813361}, "language": "english", "review": "Trying to kill your friend as a fish. \nFish...\n\n7/10 \n\nbuy on sale", "timestamp_created": 1463813597, "timestamp_updated": 1463813597, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23110874": {"recommendationid": "23110874", "author": {"steamid": "76561198273409116", "num_games_owned": 101, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 2896, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506926016}, "language": "english", "review": "\u4e0d\u9519\u7684\u4e00\u6b3e\u6e38\u620f\u5462\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u8fd8\u662f\u4ed6\u7684\u65b0\u5947\u5730\u4e0b\u57ce\u98ce\u683c\u3002\n\u8f6e\u6d41\u7684\u82f1\u96c4\uff0c\u8f6e\u6d41\u7684\u602a\u7269\uff0c\u6740\u6b7b\u82f1\u96c4\u53d8\u6210\u82f1\u96c4\uff0c\u88ab\u6740\u6b7b\u53d8\u6210\u602a\u7269\uff0c\u602a\u7269\u4e0d\u65ad\u963b\u6b62\u82f1\u96c4\uff0c\u82f1\u96c4\u4e0d\u65ad\u6740\u6b7b\u602a\u7269\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u6253\u8d25\u5927BOOS\u7684\u82f1\u96c4\u80dc\u5229\uff01\n\u602a\u7269\u53ef\u4ee5\u8fdb\u5316\u6210\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u602a\u7269\uff0c\u82f1\u96c4\u53ef\u4ee5\u8d2d\u4e70\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u9053\u5177\u3002\n\u66f4\u8ba9\u559c\u7231\u5267\u60c5\u7684\u6211\u662f\uff0c\u90a3\u6b21\u66f4\u65b0\u5728\u6bcf\u5c40\u5f00\u59cb\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u4e2a\u5c0f\u5267\u60c5\uff0c\u5f88\u5174\u594b\u5462\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u5462\uff0c\u633a\u63a8\u8350\u5462\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1463811637, "timestamp_updated": 1463811637, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498994", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23110474": {"recommendationid": "23110474", "author": {"steamid": "76561198121720576", "num_games_owned": 40, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 869, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511130862}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Inderviscificadocitacion withoun nonsensation crimination somewhere termination.", "timestamp_created": 1463809198, "timestamp_updated": 1463809198, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23099597": {"recommendationid": "23099597", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011263543", "num_games_owned": 1324, "num_reviews": 63, "playtime_forever": 290, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497428402}, "language": "english", "review": "Even in its Early Access state, This is one of the best local Co-op Games on steam.

It is nothing but constant frenetic action with your friends, and there's always something to unlock. All this game needs to do now is perform a little bit more monster/hero balancing and slowly add in content over time and it will be perfect. It has an excellent frame structure right now, but it just needs additional monsters, weapons/items, dungeon layouts, themes, and bosses.\n\nI would relaly love to see what a castle, crypt, or swamp themed dungeon would look like. I would love to see more varied bosses as well. RIght now the three headed dragon boss feels a little underpowered compared to the tentacle monster.\n\nThe only mechanic that I still find odd is the one where all players lose if they kill the hero during the final third boss fight. It's like there's no reason to continue for monster players in the third round fight --- unless the point is (if we're going down, you're going down with us) ? Either way, I'd like to see a type of modification or adjustment to done to this and see what you guys can come up with. Otherwise, I feel there isn't much of an incentive for the ghost/monster players to keep playing once the third boss battle begins.\n\nTo reiterate, Crawl has an excellent skeleton, it just needs to have some more tasty meat on its bones and it will become perfect. It really is such a beatuifully designed game. I absolutely LOVE the unlock system. If you keep adding more, I'll keep playing more just to see what else I can unlock with my friends.

You get a fair amount of time playing diety/monsters and dungeoneer.  As you progress down through the dungeon you can buy weapons and spealls and upgrade your monsters.  You end the round by defeating the boss or being beaten as the boss by another player (which is really awesome on either side.  You're either battling a giant monster or get to control the giant monster.)  After you finish a round you start over with a bunch more diety/monsters unlocked.  The graphics and music are retro (pixels,2D) but done very well. 10/10 will crawl again.\n\nEdit: One last thought.  Online multiplayer.  This game definitely needs it.

Instead of shooting, there is hack n' slash combat. That is where similarities end. \n\nWhen the game start, what happens is a wonderfully crafted, simple yet effective backstory is given as to the 'what and why' of the game. The 4 heroes (up to 4 players or 3 AI) are reduced to 1 while the other players(or AI) now become the spirits. Those spirits are now your enemy. \n\nIt is the Hero's job to reach at least hero level 10 and kill the boss, all while surviving the traps and monsters that lurk in the dungeon. To do this, the hero will need to stock up on gear and weapons found in the Blcksmiths shop. \n\nThe spirits are tasked with taking down the hero by means of possesing the traps and summoning runes that lay marked on the floor. Those summoning runes turn the spirits into 1 of 3 monsters from their \"monster loadout\". Once one of them kills the hero, they then take on the role of hero, slayer of ghouls and the fiends they possess. \n\nThroughout the game, the hero levels up and sometimes gets rewarded with gold by finding interactive objects or dealing damage to the hero as sppirits. The spirits on the other hand evolve by earning their own currency gained by causing harm to the hero or when the hero levels up. \n\nIt is a fun and rewarding back and forth game that is surprisingly well balanced with no bugs that I have encountered. I bought this game just a few days before I found it was also part of my Humble Monthly quite some time ago. I did not request a refund from steam for my purchase however because this game is easily worth the money I paid. I would recomend this game to anyone who has local buddies (or can play solo) and loves dungeon crawlers.\n\nOTHER THINGS AND STUFF\nThings it could improve would be to add online functionality, and more diversity to the level design, although neither is required for this already magnificent game.\n\nGo give the game a chance!\n\nEdit: After spending more time in this game, my review still holds. If anything, I think higher of this game. It is truly something special. They have added more voicework, nee items, a new boss, new mechanics, and new monsters to control.

The replay-ability of this game is actually amazing! I used to play this game with my brother a year ago and now I have most of the people on my college dorm floor actually addicted to palying it. This, combined with the fact that the game isn't actually finished is stunning. The balance between human and monster gameplay is amazing. Many people will talk bad about how some monsters you can just troll with, and to that I say, \"Git gud.\"\n\nThe only problems I have observed with this game are the variety of final bosses. There are currently two. Most of the time a certain player has the skills to destroy a certain boss, no matter how good the boss controlers are. Therefore, sometimes its up to the flip of a coin as to if someone will win the game automatically or not. HOWEVER, I am happy to hear that they have annaounced and are in the progess of making a thrid boss. This will fix the lack of variety.\n\nAnother note is that the longer you play the more you find really cool room themes. Some I have seen semi-frequently are rooms with the walls/floors lined with blood sigils or rooms that have grass and vegetation. I would love to see even more of these fun-to-find environments as the game is developed.\n\nOverall, this early access game could be a game all on its own right now if it wanted to. However, I am very glad work is still being done on it. I encourage literally everyone to buy and play this game.

One person plays a hero traversing a dungeon, and the other players play as the dungeon and enemies.  When a monster kills the hero they take his place. The monsters are generally \"weaker\" than the hero so they need to both work together and compete to get the last hit.\n\nThe matches are fairly short, usually lasting from 15 to 30 minutes which doesn\u2019t feel like too long. The balancing mechanics are well designed, and players make comebacks regularly keeping the game close - the longer you play as a monster the better off you are if you become the hero, but wait too long and you might lose.\n\nThe hero and monsters feel good to play, and the players are given several customization options at the beginning of each game allowing them to choose a group of monsters to play as. There are also additional perks which offer variety in play styles.\n\nThere is a learning curve to the game, and understanding the different resources you have to manage and knowing each monster can be confusing to newer players. The mechanical simplicity helps a lot with this. Crawls biggest problem is that it currently has only local multiplayer and really needs online multiplayer.\n\nCrawl is intensely fun and extremely well designed. It is easily one of if not the best local multiplayer games available on steam, and an amazing value for its price.

I do have a few complaints about the overall balancing however.\n\n1. Defensive playstyles through monsters are ultimately more rewarding than aggresive playstyles, and camping is a big problem. (Atleast, in the 12 hours we've played collectively). \n\n2. Because of this, some of the final monster evolutions are not worth evolving too (Im thinking of the slug, for example)\n\n3. Part of the issue is because of all these defensive options you're given as monsters, it almost feels like online would just be overwhelmingly frustrating to deal with if it was implimented. If i wasn't sitting next to some friends playing this game, i'd probably have ragequit against the defensive playstyles in an online setting playing against people who i didn't know. (This is just personal prefernce however, and im sure online would still be an amazing adition for the community and players of this game)\n\nIf the dev's were able to find a way to combat this while not completely destroying the ranged characters playstyle, it'd be much more rewarding to play as a monster, and maybe not feel like such a scumbag to your friends all the time.\n\nNegatives aside, this is still a blast to play, and leads to many hilarious moments.

It's a really fun concept and I can see Powerhoof is trying to take as much advantage of this as they can, which of coarse is FREAKING AWESOME! I like how you don't even need to power up all the eldritch stones to activate the portal to the boss and how it's a different monster with it's own unique mechanics depending on how many you have powered up.\n\nThis game is also a good example of how a video game doesn't need a real story what so ever to be enjoyable because it could leave your imagination up to do that if you wanted to like how it does for a silent protagonist's personality or motives. You can imagine the human as a hero and the ghost(s) as the villain, or the human as the villain or the ghost(s) as the hero(s), or there could be no good guy here at all but instead just poor souls fighting over a change at freedom and riches like a bunch of hungry wolves fighting over a dead rabbit. The possibilities are endless to what it could be happening down in the caverns.\n\nCONS:\nAs fun as the game is and as much as I hate to admit it, the only thing that could make it complete is if they do put together a little online feature where you can play with friends from all over. Sure it's got local co-op AND I know that it's still on there to do list, but my point still stands that online is the only thing that's missing. But even with online still yet to be a reality, the game is pretty solid even when playing by yourself. Though when I played it by myself, I couldn't help but notice there's some slight kinks in the ghosts' AI. But it's still early access and these kinks do seem pretty minor like sometimes the ghosts would stay stuck in a corner for some reason, interracting with a trap that you're no where near which only happened once for me and they stopped obviously as soon as I left the room.\n\n\nALL IN ALL:\nReally solid game, enjoyable even when playing by yourself, still waiting on that online even after a year and a bit but they can take there times since I'm sure they're getting to that soon.", "timestamp_created": 1457885698, "timestamp_updated": 1457885698, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "21807782": {"recommendationid": "21807782", "author": {"steamid": "76561198172265561", "num_games_owned": 318, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 32, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451860515}, "language": "english", "review": "Supposedly, I have 30 minutes in this game.

Thankfully you can play with Bots who have 3 different difficulties.\n\nThe other issue I found was a bit of unbalanced gameplay when there are 4 players.

can't remember if I have ever left a review for any game in all the years I've been on steam.  If I did, it wasn't a good enough one for me to remember.  \n\nI'm leaving one now.\n\nSimply put:  This game is awesome.  This is one of THOSE games:  Games that I break out in a party setting with my friends and we play it over and over and over.  The idea behind this game is simple enough, but there's enough under the hood to add some depth and variety that it doesn't make the game boring at all or feel repetitive.  Nothing is more satisfying in the world than closing off a room from the hero (as he tries to dash to the portal),  stealing a kill from another monster player (while already at level 10) and race into the adjacent room, open the portal, and attempt to kill the boss.\n\nThis game will test friendships, no doubt.  It is worth every penny and I can't wait to see what else they add to it.  I'm not crying for lack of on-line multiplayer.  And, the game has some AI in it, so you can even play solo if you want.  (I also really like the 'drop in' / 'drop out' feature A LOT.  Very handy.)

And, it currently supports only LOCAL multiplayer. Co-op is a misnomer, because thats the furthest thing you will be doing with your friends when you jump into this game. \n\nThis game has tight, responsive combat. Some of the monsters feel worthless, but most just take some getting used to in order to be effective. You can level up the monsters between the stages with experience gained while you were the monsters/ghosts. The sounds and utility of choosing which monsters to level up and what branch in their evolution to pick is great. \n\nPlaying as the hero is gritty and fun. The more monsters you kill, the higher you can level up and also gain gold. Gold is spent at the shopkeeper to buy new weapons, skills, and upgrades. Make sure to pick the right ones! One charm makes you powerful.....but also turns you into a harmless, weak frog! Once you have reached a high enough level, you can choose to attempt to defeat the boss. Be careful! If you die enough times, it's game over and you can even lose your name and progress, having to start your file over! \n\nThere are some truly intense moments in this game. When you and a few of your ghost friends have been able to possess monsters and traps to get the friend playing the hero down to the last few hits, it gets crazy, Whomever lands the LAST HIT becomes the hero, despite who harmed them the most!

Like a normal Dungeon Crawler, you go from room to room fighting off monsters. However in Crawl, the players play as the monsters, all trying to attack the main player. The goal of the game as a monster is to kill the human player and take their place, while the goal of the human is to kill as much as possible and gain XP points. You win the game if you're the player and you go into the boss room and destroy the boss. (The other players also control the boss too!) However, you may only do this at level 10. If the players fail to slay the boss 3 times, the player who fought the third time is removed from the game forever. (And I'm not kidding, it actually deletes your name!)\n\nIf you have friends locally, this is for you. Just grab a couple of controllers. And no, unlike 70% of steam games with controller support, it DOESN'T need to have XInput. The devs of this game were sure to incorporate as much controllers as possible. As long as it has a USB that you can stick into your computer the controller probably works. Did I mention the game only uses 3 buttons and a d pad? (2 not including the start button) Haven't tested it, but this should work in theory: http://www.amazon.com/Classic-USB-NES-Controller-PC/dp/B002YVD3KM\n\nIf you want one of the best local play experiences you'll ever have, buy now. Also the game devs are really active in the community pumping out updates like mad.\n\nPositive Features:\n-Up to 4 Players Locally\n-Single player mode with AIs\n-TONS of controller options\n-Innovative control scene\n-Active Devs (As of now)\n-Low Price\n-High Repeatability\n-Cabinet mode (You may hook the game up to an arcade machine!)\n\nNegative Features:\n-No online support yet. May not come for a while. Don't buy the game hoping for online support, it's clearly not it's focus, although it may come in the future.\n\n\nOverall, this game is wonderful locally. If you're having a party or just inviting friends over, this is a must have. It's still fun with bots, but not as good with other people, I haven't played much single player but I know it's kind of a mixed response, some like it and some don't. I like it though.\n\nAlso you can fight Gabe Newell.

My friends and I have played this almost every week without fail since launch - it's that damn good. When we meet new people who claim they're into games, we vet them on this and see if they have fun or can appreciate the depth of game mechanics. We love this game because there's nothing like sitting shoulder to shoulder with a pal and howling with rage at a stolen kill, laughter at a horde of slimes causing a human to suddenly play a Shmup, or roars of hype when a close bossfight comes down to the wire. My short recommendation for this game is [b]BUY IT[/b]. But now let's get to why you should.\n\nCRAWL is a local multiplayer game that involves between 2-4 players. One player is a human, and the other 1-3 are monsters. Every time a monster kills a human, whether it being done as a monster, as a possessable slime, or a controllable trap, that player will become the human. [u]This has to be done on a last hit.[/u] This means that the three non-human players must work in a loose alliance until the very last minute, because there can only be one human!\n\nThe other gameplay mechanics are a bit more complicated than that, and I'll explain the most complicated one, the leveling system and the asymmetrical nature of the players:\n\n-A player possessing a human can kill monsters to gain XP and continue leveling up. This primarily adds extra health and to the human and gets the player closer to a boss run, since only characters with level 10 or higher can do boss runs. Humans get better gear and stats by accessing shops. They use gold that they gain primarly while being a monster (I'll get to that later)\n\n-Nonhuman players control ghosts most of the time. Ghosts can possess pentagrams to spawn as monsters and fight the humans. They can also control traps or collect ectoplasm while they're in Ghost mode to drop slimes, which are weak, autonomous/controllable monsters that can be dropped at any time. This is useful for trapping a human in a room, since humans must kill all monsters before leaving a room. Slimes aren't too strong on their own, but if the human's health is low, and/or the room is full of traps, they can be utterly devastating. All players can level up their monsters at the end of a round. Nonhuman players can also all control a boss monster Voltron-style, with each player controlling a limb or head and working together to kill the human.\n\nNow here's what keeps this asymmetrical gameplay balanced from a progression standpoint. As other players level up their human forms, all the other players get \"Wrath\", or monster XP. So as any given player human(s) get stronger, the monsters of the other players get stronger. This keeps the players' monsters roughly scaled with players' human forms, and it means that people who are especially good at playing only humans or only monsters may be in for a dramatic uphill battle once they get out of being a human/monster for an extended time. \n\nAlso, while players are monsters, they gain gold by hurting or killing the human. HOWEVER, this gold can only be used when you're a human! This means that someone who's been a monster for a long time will most likely have strong monsters, a lot of gold, but low human levels. Even if you can buy out the shop, you'll still be a pathetic creature of flesh until level up or reach the shop to get some assistance.\n\nThere's a lot more stuff going on here as well. Single-fight upgrades that require slime/gold/human health sacrifice, spells, dodge rolls, blink teleports, poisoned food, magic staffs, frog hexes, cursed weapons (that make you insane), repeating crossbows, Gabe Newell, I could just keep going on and on. Let's just say there's a LOT of content packed in the core game, and different human/monster builds play very differently from each other. There is also a ingame database to keep track of all the traps, monsters, and items, and even a monster/boss duel mode, where you can practice as a human or as a monster to improve your skills.\n\nThe only drawback I could say about this game is the fact that it doesn't have online multiplayer, and that it is quite different in terms of gameplay flow when you get started for the first time. The online multiplayer aspect is not a big deal. This game plays at a fast, almost twitch-like speed, and lag would utterly ruin the experience. As for the gameplay, a gross approximation I would make is classic Zelda crossed with Dark Souls, but the monsters are hilarious jerks because they're your friends sitting next to you! But really, it's a bit of a gross approximation - CRAWL is one of a kind. And the devs are great guys. They provide substantial updates to this game - not very often, but it's only 2 guys and they take the time to address balance issues while adding content during updates. They'll even talk to you on their Facebook page and respond to emails you send them. \n\nI'll say this though: if you ask them about online multiplayer, they'll tell you that they'll finish the game first then add it later, so don't get your hopes up.\n\nAnyway, get it, my personal GOTY every year since it launched because it's just so damn fun.", "timestamp_created": 1453663662,

One of the best games I've ever played. This is an addictive, competitive, dungeon crawler that will keep you on the edge of your seat when fighting friends. Most of the monsters seem balanced and are very fun to use.\n\nHowever...\n\nMonsters Problems- The Green Shaman monster thing that summons the zombies need to be nerfed to hell and back. It's very very fast, and has so much health. Not to mention that the slime it leaves behind slows you down so much it's not even a fun challenge. The tentacle things need to have slightly lower health and weak attacks also. The one that is able to go underground and then come back up and attack you is way too ogrepowered. It need to have lower health or do less damage, or not be able to go underground as often. The other one's not as bad, but the tentacles it makes come from the ground are SUPER bulky and take up the whole screen! The minotaur that stems from the rat monster needs to be slower or have a longer recharge on it's sprint. I'm really good with a bow and it frustrates my friends when I kill them because they can't even reach me due to me speeding around the map so often. Other than these specific monsters, I can't really think of anything else in the monster catagory.\n\nBoss Problems- Kourok needs to have more health and need to be stronger. Something about Kourok needs to be stronger because anytime someone activates the portal, it's either guarunteed death, (Ghidraak) or a free pass to beat the game. Kourok is nowhere near as strong as Ghidraak and is too easy of a boss. Ghidraak is WAY TOO STRONG! I have probably beaten this boss maybe 3-4 times when fighting it. It is incredibly overpowered in full dragon form, but the fact that EACH INDIVIDUAL HAED GETS THEIR OWN LIFE AFTER DETACHMENT completely breaks the game. You struggle through enough with fighting the boss. Some people are probably saying \"That's why the healer is there!\", but it doesn't matter! Even if the healer doesn't get hit AT ALL to where he doesn't run away, he only drops 3-4 health orbs at the MOST. It MIGHT be okay for Ghidraak's head to each have a second chanceif their ealth wasn't so high. Their health is the same as if not more that it takes to knock it off of the dragon body in the first place.\n\nPLEASE PLEASE POWERHOOF! FIX GHIDRAAK!!!! PLEASE! The ending of the game literallly depends on if the human gets Ghidraak or Kourok, and that's really unbalanced and unfair. It needs to come down to the players skill, and no matter how much skill you have, it's near impossible to kill Ghidraak, even without competant playuers.

This can become a bit of a clusterfuck if you have 3 enemy players, as some of the rooms are very small in regards to the amount of anti-hero objects in them.\n\nThe leveling up features seem pretty smooth, as well as the Wrath mechanics, and the shop. The Boss pentagram that appears on each level (accessible at lvl 10) sends you to a room where you battle one of many huge bosses. This can feel a bit like an attack-spam sometimes, but only if you are significantly prepared for the boss through the purchase of upgrades. It does still feel like a retro boss battle.\n\nOverall I would give Crawl an 8/10\n\nThey are bringing something new and interesting to the table in the form of something familiar. It is a great game to play  alone, or with friends, and it's a great excuse to cuss your friends out when they booby trap kill you before the final room.", "timestamp_created": 1451720084, "timestamp_updated": 1451720084, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "20205059": {"recommendationid": "20205059", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032869358", "num_games_owned": 172, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 383, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451711778}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is pretty good, but if you play it to long your brain will hurt.

Hat f\u00fcr mich aber seinen eigenen Charm und frustiert nicht durch Ruckler oder Frameeinbr\u00fcche.\n\n\n\n_STORY_ [3/5]:\nEin rastloser Held der sich bem\u00fcht aus einem Verlies zu entkommen, w\u00e4hrend die rachs\u00fcchtigen Geister ihn nach seiner Menschlichkeit trachten. \n\nDie Story ist noch immer besser, als die von Halo 5 :P, ausserdem gibt es viele Geheimnisse und liebevoll gemachte Zust\u00e4nde im Spiel, die nicht verraten m\u00f6chte, die jedoch Atmosph\u00e4re ins Spiel bringen, deshalb m\u00f6chte ich die fehlende Story nicht als allzu schlecht bewerten.\n_Spielmechanik_ [10/5]:\n\nGrundmechanik [20/5]:\n\nCrawl macht erst spa\u00df, wenn man es mit Freunden spielt. (Bis zu 4Spieler)\nJemand spielt den Held, der versucht Stufe 10 zu kommen um den Endboss zu vernichten. (LevelCap: 20)\nDie anderen spielen Geister die D\u00e4monen beschw\u00f6ren k\u00f6nnen und verschiedene Fallen benutzen k\u00f6nnen, um den Helden um die Ecke zu bringen. Derjenige der den Helden t\u00f6tet, bekommt seine menschlichkeit wieder und wird zu helden. Level und Gegenst\u00e4nde gehen in der Partie nicht verloren. Eine Partie endet, wenn die Gruppe 3mal scheiterte einen der bisher 2 Endbosse zu t\u00f6ten oder den Endboss besiegt. \n\nHeld:\nDer Held sammelt Erfahrung und Gold.\n\nMit GOLD kann er sich Buffs, F\u00e4higkeiten und Waffen kaufen. \nDabei gibt es verschiedene Waffentypen, die sich von ihrer Handhabung unterscheiden. Die Waffen obwohl sie den gleichen Typen haben, k\u00f6nnen dabei verschiedene Effekte haben und nat\u00fcrliche verschiedene Schadensarten.\nF\u00e4higkeiten & Buffs unterscheiden sich nur von ihrer Handhabung.\n\nMit ERFAHRUNG steigt er Level auf, mit der Eigenschaften automatisch auflevelt. Mit Stufe 10 kann er durch ein Portal reisen.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1450004468, "timestamp_updated": 1450004468, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "19666711": {"recommendationid": "19666711", "author": {"steamid": "76561198252157802", "num_games_owned": 15, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 55, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1449963270}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is amazing!

I'm certain it's a lot more fun with a full party, but if your game consists of only two players it is over quite quickly. The monster evolution trees can be fairly short and the requirement to unlock the boss is easy to attain. I would like to see an option wherein you can increase the level required to access the boss.\n\nThe mouse and keyboard controls are also terrible independently. You can either pick the keyboard or the mouse, but not both.

Pues porque s\u00f3lo 1 es humano y los otros 1, 2, o 3 son fantasmas que intentan matarte para reencarnar en tu cuerpo (por as\u00ed decirlo) mediante pactos en el suelo en las c\u00e1maras donde te vas, los cuales les sirven a los fantasmas para reencarnar en un monstruo e intentar matarte y pos obtener tu cuerpo 7u7. Es original, al menos para mi porque ningun juego que haya jugado tiene este tipo de cosas, y simple porque es morirte, invocar y matar y revivir... IZI.\n\nLa jugabilidad o el control no es complicada puesto a que... como les digo... s\u00f3lo 2 botones para atacar, el de ataque simple y el especial, y aparte las flechas para moverte (en el teclado, en el mouse pues moverlo :v y el mando la palanca)\nas\u00ed que si no te gusta jugar con alguno, cambiaselo a un amigo por otro si es que juegas con un amigo.\n\nLes cuento que en el transcurso que eh jugado el tiempo de las partidas son de larga duraci\u00f3n puesto a que te mueres y en el transcurso en que intentas matar al vato que es humano es largo, y a veces te roban la reencarnaci\u00f3n xD (me a pasado :'v), en promedio creo que +20 min. por ser que invocar al boss el lvl minimo es de 10.\n\nLas actualizaciones son hermosas, agregan objetos para implementar la fuera, agilidad o la vida, otros objetos pues te convierten en vampiro, te mandan a tragarte un coraz\u00f3n de humano, demonio, etc. Una an\u00e9cdota mia es que hace como marzo que no juego y ahora en noviembre (2015) implementaron algo en la interfaz de el niveleo de monstruos, para no espoilearles cuando la pones es \u00e9pico nivelear tus monstruos y escuchar a tus amigos nivelear a los suyos *-*.\n\nBueno, b\u00e1sicamente en mi opini\u00f3n y criterio con el cual critico este juego, es un gran juego para jugar con amigos como s\u00f3lo pues se pone jarcor cuando peleas con las cpu :v (perr*s 8)) estilo mata y revive si es que existe con actualizaciones fant\u00e1sticas, objetos, monstruos y mec\u00e1nicas originales que te dejan con un buen sabor de boca. 10/10 ''Oh mai gunnes'' Lion Hirus 2015\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1447738549, "timestamp_updated": 1447738549, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "19117645": {"recommendationid": "19117645", "author": {"steamid": "76561198238337934", "num_games_owned": 92, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 174, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1471849491}, "language": "english", "review": "Very fun multiplayer bash.

It is not only kill their contrling creeps, but also cooperate with your other creeps which your friend's contrling,  against the hero to slow him go furder and earn the blood to upgrade your creeps, or just kill him-when you think he is suck, too weak in the other word- to be a hero-then you will be the hero. The hero would upgrade- of course -and also can buy the magic, item, weapon and so on to be more stronger. When the hero upgrade to lvl10, the hero can activate the charm to teleport to the final boss room. The boss would be contrled by other players, cooperate to kill the hero. If the boss kills the hero, the game will continue, otherwise, game over, the hero who kills the boss wins. The charm can only activate 3 times, after 3 times, game over also (I forget who will win in this case because no boss alives in our hands).

With either a three-headed dragon or some weird chubby alein thing. However playing the human wont be easy because your bastard freinds. ( Or CPU's. ) will be playing as ghosts trying to beat every last clump of living poo out of you. As a ghost you can posses traps to make them attack the human, which is supprisingly effective. Or you can go the more aggresive and entertaining way. Turning into a monster. Playing as the bad guy never felt so good but you wont be laughing for long, because if you are the one to deliver the finishing blow to the puny mortal. You basicly switch spots with the person you killed, so now they get to have ajolly old time chasing you around.

This keeps the game balanced very well. \nA hero can use collected gold to purchase new weapons, spells and accessories at shops. The hero also uses xp to level up to level 10.

If you could find a way to do it without color it'd be even better -- I have color blind friends and they were particularly handicapped.\n\nAnother, with exponentially more effort, is the addition of more \"area\" types; you could do an ice place, or jungle ruins place, I don't care, just a couple more different color swatches to look at would help with playing this over and over. I'm sure you've put an INSANE amount of effort into all the animation polish; hopefully just adding in a couple more environments wouldn't be so difficult.\n\nI know you're really focused on the playable monsters but try not to neglect bosses, the atmosphere, etc. Not that you have, It'd just be a shame for you to stop with just that.\n\nAnyway, great work so for with this.

I invited some friends over, and we had a blast screwing each other over, and continue to to this day. The game has come so far, starting with just 3 evolutionary trees and a handful of monsters, to 10+ trees, 40 monsters, and a gigantic variety of monster-slaying weaponry to fend off your impending doom. If you're looking for a fun party game with an arcadey, rpg feel, this is the game for you. If I had the opportuntiy to buy this game again, I would gladly do so,\n\nI do have a few minor complaints -- you almost need controllers to have the best experience. Playing with the keyboard or mouse is sufficient, but controllers provide a more fuild playstyle. Other than that, the only other problem I have is that some evolutionary trees seem to be better than others, but that really depends on your proficiency with certain monsters. \n\nAs of when this review was written, there are only two bosses, but the ghosts work together inside of one boss to thwart the player. There is a hydra, with three heads -- fire, ice, and poison -- and a kranken that fires an enormous laser whilist trapping the hero in bubbles and spewing pink acid. Nothing is more satisfying than killing the boss on your ast try, with 1 health remaining... or, killing the hero at the very last second.\n\nHaving all 4 players isn't a necesity, but does provide a unique experience. Colluding with your friends to utterly destroy the human is such a fun feeling. If you don' have 4 friends immediately around, playing vs another friend is a challenge that tests your ability to fully utilize your monsters and/or hero abilities and skills. On the off-chance you have exactly 0 people to play with, you can always fight with the AI on varrying difficulty levels.\n\n10/10, would kill friends over and over again.", "timestamp_created": 1442678663, "timestamp_updated": 1442678663, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506062", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "18091811": {"recommendationid": "18091811", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028803069", "num_games_owned": 92, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1216, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499563312}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun tbh.", "timestamp_created": 1442623040, "timestamp_updated": 1452807447, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "18070380": {"recommendationid": "18070380", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069839080", "num_games_owned": 14, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4491, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506954993}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is awesome, best game for local multiplayer I have ever played, (and belive I played them a lot)\nWhat I liked about this game: EVERYTHING\nWhat I disliked: Nothing", "timestamp_created": 1442495915, "timestamp_updated": 1442495915, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "18036725": {"recommendationid": "18036725", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019589939", "num_games_owned": 284, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1268, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511407134}, "language": "english", "review": "+ Lots of Unlockables\n+ Easter eggs\n+ Nostalgia\n\nEasily my new favorite party game.", "timestamp_created": 1442268994, "timestamp_updated": 1442269028, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "18027880": {"recommendationid": "18027880", "author": {"steamid": "76561198098067824", "num_games_owned": 23, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 746, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492341059}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0428\u0438\u043a\u0430\u0440\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0435\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u0445\u043e\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0447\u044e\u0432\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0432\u0435\u0441\u044c \u0448\u0430\u0440\u043c \u0442\u043e \u043a\u0443\u043f\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u0433\u0435\u0439\u043c\u043f\u0430\u0434!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1442221796, "timestamp_updated": 1442221796, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "18007305": {"recommendationid": "18007305", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076788684", "num_games_owned": 178, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 477, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490869763}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0414\u0430\u0436\u0435 \u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u0432 \u043d\u0435\u0451 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043d\u043e.\n10/10 \u043f\u043e \u0432\u0441\u0435\u043c \u043f\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043c\u0435\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043c.", "timestamp_created": 1442104408, "timestamp_updated": 1442104408, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "18006806": {"recommendationid": "18006806", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013913525", "num_games_owned": 1117, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 942, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505653607}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Tan genial como pinta y m\u00e1s.", "timestamp_created": 1442101510, "timestamp_updated": 1442101510, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "17977412": {"recommendationid": "17977412", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013279254", "num_games_owned": 456, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 385, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496608820}, "language": "english", "review": "An absolute blast, especially with three friends.

This game was put onto Steam's early access list in August 2014. The developers are very active with producing updates and content for the game, as you can see by their updated blog - http://www.powerhoof.com/\n\nWhilst I try to steer clear of Early Access games, and especially reviewing them, I decided to break my trend and try this game out as it was one I have been following for a while now. \n\nCrawl can be played single player, or with up to four people on local co-op. I have only played single player so far, so my review will be solely based on that.  \n\nOne of the players will control the hero, and the others will be in control of ghosts. The ghost's aim is to kill the hero, they can do this by possessing traps in the randomly generated dungeon the hero is crawling through. Ghosts are also able to spawn into demons and monsters in various rooms.  The hero will gain experience points by killing monsters put before him, more experience means more health and more damage. The hero will also find gold, which can be used to purchase new weapons, items, potions and special abilities.  Once the ghost manages to kill a hero, they swap roles and you rinse and repeat. Monsters which kill the hero will be rewarded with Wrath points, these points can be used at the end of each level to level up the monsters to be able to do more damage and gain more powerful abilities. \n\nThe traps found throughout the dungeons can vary from bouncing spike walls, to bolt arrow turrets. All of them provide a sufficient threat for the hero, since they can't actually be destroyed, all the hero can do is escape to the next room. Unlike the monsters, where the hero has to clear the room before being able to move on. \n\nCrawl uses a nicely presented pixel style art which has a nice charm to it. Whilst it is more pixelated than most games that use this style, it actually looks a lot better than most of them. It gives it a feel as if you are playing in an arcade, with the Metal Slug style character selection screen, and the health bars at the bottom for all the players. I really enjoyed the look of Crawl, even though it's using a style which is growing very thin in the PC market at the moment. \n\nFrom what I have seen so far, there is no story behind any of the game, purely focuses on the gameplay elements. \n\nTo begin with, Crawl is a very hard game to get to grips with. There isn't an easily find-able help menu or tutorial, and you are kind of just left to figure it out on your own. Whilst this can be done after ten or fifteen minutes, it would of been nice to get a proper introduction to the game. Since I was playing on single player mode, and was up against the AI all the time, I managed to breeze through the levels with hardly any difficulty at all. When it comes to purchasing items from the shop, the AI just seemed to pick things at random, whether they are worse than what they currently had or not. Maybe this is something which can be fixed in up coming updates.  I would anticipate the multiplayer mode to be where a difficulty curve takes a large rise though. \n\nAll of the dungeons in Crawl are randomly generated, so I can't really say much about the level design, but what I can say is that all the rooms are still interesting to be in, they have a large selection of breakable objects, some of which will hold extra gold, there are normally one or two traps in each room for the ghosts to poses, and there are normally, two, if not three, summoning ports for the ghosts to take control of one of their minions or monsters. \n\nThere is a huge amount of replay-ability to be had with Crawl; I am about two hours into playing so far, and I am barely scratching the surface as to the amount of gameplay there is. Each time you finish a run, you unlock new weapons, items and abilities to use, making the next run you play completely different to the last.  I would absolutely love to see some sort of online multiplayer added to this game, limiting it to just local multiplayer seems like a silly idea to me, especially if you are putting your game on Steam. It could so easily be integrated with Steam's servers and made to be a fantastic online multiplayer experience. \n\nI had no technical issues whilst playing the game. A controller is highly recommended, as most rogue-likes go, it is increasingly difficult to play these games on a keyboard. \n\nTo conclude, since Crawl is still an early access title, I am simply going to recommend it, but verging on the side of caution. Whilst the devs are still updating the game currently, early access games always run the risk of never being completed. However, the game has a low enough in price to allow you to take that risk with the knowledge that you are easily getting your money's worth as things stand at the moment. If/when this game gets a full release, it's easily going to be a game you'll keep installed ready to launch when you have friends over.\n\n\n[b][u] Tom's Score Card[/u][/b]\n1) Stay away\n2) Only recommended when on sale\n[b][u]3) Recommended[/u][/b]\n4) Highly recommended\n5) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

\"asteroids\" based twin stick shooters.\nWithin these 2 large pools there are some stellar gems, a lot of winners, a few minor tweaks and innovations and a lot of \"others\" that don't really distinguish them selves well.\nFor the most part, if you have a handful of entries from these groups in your library, you'll have the basics covered and dipping back in too the pools probably won't net you anything wonderfully different.\n\nSo it's always exciting when clever people come up with something that feel radically different with out over complicating what you seek out from these experiances.\nNighogg is a great example of this idea, and if you're looking at Crawl as a multiplayer couch gamer, you probably already know about the joys of that.\n\nWhat Crawl offers is different again... and does take a minute more to absorb, but after that you will be drinking in a game that takes the head to head nature of this genre and mixes in a brilliant and ever changing landscape of all vs 1 and and great \"begining-middle-end\" arc in each session.\n\nIf you have your basic couch conflict games covered, Get Nidhogg and get this and you'll have a great little menu to pick from.\n\nNighog for instantly accessable gaming at snack like speed.\nTwin stick arenas and 1 screen platformers for experiances with a hair more length and variable substance.\nCrawl for a solid hunk

Its pretty much like its not in early access. What I like about the game is that there are a lot of possibilities in the battle of who is to win. I like how there are only three chances you get to win the game. With that being said, anyone over the level of 10 could go for it when they reach the shrine. As of right now there are two bosses you can either be or fight which is randomly chosen for you when you activate the shrines. Either you or the other 3 players (depending on who activates the shrine) become part of the three parts of the boss, and you have to try to defeat the boss while the others use the boss to defeat you. Anyone can fail twice fighting the boss battles. The third time whoever fails will ultimately lose the game and the other players win in a first, second, third basis.(The loser being 4th) I also like the dynamic of there is one hero and the others are ghosts vying for the life of the hero and use forms of monsters to try to steal the life of the hero and become him. All an all this is a great game and I cannot wait for the full version. What I would like to see in the full version is a database for all that you unlock like a lore, just like Risk Of Rain.

Eine Runde ca. 1 Stunde mit dem Potential 1-3 Freundschaften zu zerst\u00f6ren. Das Spiel h\u00f6rt sich nicht nur interessant an, sondern ist es auch. \n\nMan spielt mit 2-4 Spielern, oder Bots, wobei 1 Spieler der \"Held\" ist und die anderen 1-3 Spieler die \"Schurken\" sind, die dem Helden die Tour versauen sollen. Die fiesen Geister die von den 3 anderen Spielern gesteuert werden, k\u00f6nnen Schleime (Ectoplasma) spawnen, die dem Helden schaden, sowie die Kontrolle \u00fcber diverse Monster \u00fcbernehmen um den Helden den Todessto\u00df zu verpassen. Der Held levelt indem er Monster t\u00f6tet und Kristalle zerst\u00f6rt, kann Gold finden, und im Shop neue Waffen, Zauber, Tr\u00e4nke etc. kaufen. Das Ziel des Helden ist es den Endboss zu besiegen. Der Bossraum kann ab Stufe 10 betreten, aber vermutlich noch nicht bezwungen, werden. Immer wenn einer der Schurken den Helden t\u00f6tet, wird er zum Helden und versucht  Stufen aufzusteigen und gute Ausr\u00fcstung zu erwerben. Der gefallene Held wird zum Schurken. Nach jedem \"Floor\" k\u00f6nnen die Monster die den Schurken zur Verf\u00fcgung stehen upgegradet werden und bei betreten eines neuen \"Floors\" \u00e4ndert sich der Dungeon komplett. Neue R\u00e4ume, Neue Gegenst\u00e4nde im Shop. Besiegt der Held den Enboss, so gewinnt er. Verlieren die Helden 3 mal gegen den Endboss, so gewinnen die Schurken. Ich durfte beide Szenarios bereits erleben.\n\nWas mir an diesem Spiel sehr gef\u00e4llt ist, dass man sich sehr hineinsteigert und wirklich sein absolut Bestes gibt. Der Held will nicht sterben und der Schurke will den Todessto\u00df setzen um selber weiter zu kommen.\nWeiterhin werden nach jeder Runde die man gespielt hat neue Waffen, Zauber, Bosse, Monstersets usw. freigeschaltet. Wovon am Ende alle etwas haben.\n\nDas Einzige was mir oder uns nicht gefallen hat ist, dass die Rolle des Helden nicht Reihum geht, sondern immer demjenigen zuteil wird der ihm den Todessto\u00df verpasst hat. Macht schon Sinn, aber wenn man Pech hat kommt man so ziemlich lange oder gar nicht dazu den Helden zu spielen. Aber es l\u00e4sst sich dar\u00fcber streiten ob das nun gut oder schlecht ist.\n\nFazit:\nDieses Spiel ist seinen Preis aufjedenfall wert. Es wirkt nicht wie ein Early Access-Spiel, sondern wie ein verdammt spa\u00dfiges Vollst\u00e4ndiges Spiel.

This is one of the few games where I feel that the addiction that I get from playing it, is worth it. \n\nPros: \n -Requires almost no system specs. Could easily be a smartphone game. (I get ~1000fps... Yeah, it's great)\n -Fun to play\n -Very little, if any, learning curve.\n -Local multiplayer\n -Controller Support\n -Up to four players\n -You can play solo with NPC's\n -The AI on the NPC's is so good, I would think they're real people if it told me so.\n -Competetive, and a great game to play with family/friends\n -Music is great\n -Different weapons to fit different play styles (I like the claymore, it's got really fast attack speed)\n\nCons:\n -Not too many cons, this game is pretty good\n -One little thing: If you are playing the ghost, and you and an allied ghost both happen to spawn the same monster, you \n   might get mixed up on who is who, because they are the same skin.\n\nTL;DR\nGet this game.

Awesome.\nThis dungeon crawling masterpiece is incredibly fun to play. I love playing it so much. Here's why:\n-Radomized Dungeons: Each time you play the game, you get something different. Even the textures on the wall are different each run.\n-Wide Variety of Weapons: There are lots of different weapons to choose from, and not all of them are the same. There are heavy melee, light melee, ranged weapons, and magic weapons as well as various spells/abilities that can be aquired during a run.\n-Play as the Monsters: This game is meant for 2-4 players (I suggest 4 even if 3 are bots), 1 player is the hero while the other 3 are ghosts who can become monsters to try to kill the hero and take his place. It adds a unique feel to this game. \n-Multiplayer Mayhem: This game really is meant to be played by 4 people (even if can be played by 1), with 4 people this game becomes an all out brawl to become the hero and beat the boss to clear the game.

It creates some really fun tims with friends even if it's not online multiplayer, and has unlimited replay-ability. But now for my recomendations to the developers. I beilive 3 things are needed to make this game even better than it already is, the first is just simply more enemies, bosses, and items, however I know that those are all in development already anyway. The second is online multiplayer, but that is a very time-consuming feature and maybe not worth it in the long-run. The third is a new team mode, where there is 2 humans at once, both of them with weakend health, and sharing gold though. And of course 2 monsters, both on the same team. So that when you kill one of the humans the other one also dies and swtiches to the monster, and both monsters become humans. This would make a really fun addition to the game, with the enjoyment of fighting against even AI with your freind on your team. And I think this should seriously be condisidered to add an awesome new element to an already amazing game.", "timestamp_created": 1433675777, "timestamp_updated": 1433675777, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497628", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "16237290": {"recommendationid": "16237290", "author": {"steamid": "76561198102710602", "num_games_owned": 42, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1631, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492692120}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u770b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e0b\u597d\u50cf\u8fd8\u6ca1\u6709\u4e2d\u6587\u8bc4\u8bba\u4e8e\u662f\u6211\u5c31\u6765\u5199\u4e00\u7bc7\u5427\uff0c\u8fd9\u6e38\u620f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4eba\u73a9\u4e3b\u8981\u662f\u73a9\u4e2a\u65b0\u5947\u611f\uff0c\u591a\u4eba\u73a9\u624d\u662f\u8fd9\u6b3e\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u7cbe\u9ad3\uff0c\u597d\u53cb\u4e4b\u95f4\u4e92\u76f8\u5751\u5bb3\u7684\u90a3\u79cd\u611f\u89c9\u771f\u662f\u505c\u4e0d\u4e0b\u6765\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u4f60\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u6216\u8005\u51e0\u4e2a\u597d\u53cb\u4e00\u8d77\u73a9\u7684\u8bdd\u5f3a\u70c8\u63a8\u8350\u8fd9\u6b3e\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u5f53\u7136\u6536\u85cf\u4e00\u4e0b\u4e5f\u662f\u4e0d\u9519\u7684\uff0c\u4e07\u4e00\u4ee5\u540e\u51fa\u8054\u673a\u529f\u80fd\u4e86\u5462\uff1f", "timestamp_created": 1433663027, "timestamp_updated": 1433663027, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522059", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "16216796": {"recommendationid": "16216796", "author": {"steamid": "76561198154404730", "num_games_owned": 41, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 332, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498444209}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is really fun!

The idea and setting of the game is utterly marvelous. Not only creeping through a dungeon with your friends trying to cause your downfall, but with care, they can take that delicious chance of freedom from you is so very entertaining. I personally love the art style, it's suitable and really helps set the theme for this dark dungeon crawl. The controls are simple, yet very satisfying, every strike with a blade and every dodge to spare your life is as satisfying as any. Not to mention the monsters you encounter, some you love and some you hate, but that makes you fight so much harder just to make sure you do not see your grinning friend shout in success as he steals your humanity. Though many people have complained about an online functionality, I understand however am not too upset by it. If there is not going to be an online function however, I would like to see some improvements to the AI. Often I've found the AI to act in peculiar ways, like they're on a cycle, letting another AI or player get away with things completely at certain times and it's tremendously obvious when they do so. I'd like to see the AI be a little more dynamic and not quite so inclined to help each other, it is a desperate fight for freedom after all.

Upon slaying these monsters, you gain experience points, which you can use to fight the boss after you have collected enough.\n\nIf your friend (a monster) kills you, you swap places, meaning you spawn the monsters, and they fight them. When you kill the adventurer, you gain \"hero blood\" which you can trade for gold to spend at a shop, spending it on weapons, allies, and abilities.\n\nWhen you eventually fight the boss, the game doesn't stop being multiplayer. Oh, no. The non-adventurers must actually possess parts of the massive boss and work together to defeat the adventurer. If the adventurer kills the boss, he/she wins. If the boss \"kills\" (you teleport back aways) the adventurer 3 times, the game is over.\n\nWhen a game is over, you can unlock new monsters which players can transform their previous monsters into. You also unlock new abilities for monsters and adventurers, etcetera.\n\nOverall, I think that Crawl is a masterpiece. The pixel-art blends very well with the shifts in scene, the soudtrack is amazing, and the gameplay itself is one-of-a-kind.\n\nI rate this game 10/10, and it's still in development.

You can play it against bots and they work great but multiplayer is really where it's at. It feels like arcade games used to back in the golden age of arcade games.\n\nIt makes a great party game, but take note that the multiplayer is local only and you will need joypads. \nOne player can use the keyboard but you can't aim precisely using it. You can use this to handicap a player if they're winning too often though, or turn off precise aiming for everyone if you like. You can even use a mouse as a controller if you're desperate.\n\nPowerhoof have also added a 'taunt your god' option, which you can use to handicap individual players in a variety of ways, fixing the one gripe I did have about the game.\n\nOne player at a time has human form and all the other players are ghosts that gang up and try to kill them with monsters and traps.

Neben K\u00e4nguruhs umschubsen, entwickelt man einfach mal einen der besten Multiplayer-Titel der vergangenen Monate.\nAlles an diesem Spiel schreit Multiplayer und das ist auch das Herzst\u00fcck des Spiels. Aber zun\u00e4chst mal ein intensiver Blick auf das Spielprinzip.\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\n\nHier sind wir beim Herzst\u00fcck des Spiels. Selten habe ich ein derart genial und einfallsreich ausbalanciertes asymmetrisches Spielprinzip erlebt, wie in Crawl. Zu Beginn eines Durchlaufs wird per Zufall entschieden, welcher der bis zu 4 menschlichen Spieler als Held startet und welche als Geister. Die Geister fliegen nun, ganz ihrer Eigenschaft entsprechend, durch die Gegend und sammeln Ektoplasma ein. Daf\u00fcr d\u00fcrfen sie dann Blobs spawnen. Um dem Helden wirklich zu traktieren, bedarf es aber ganz anderer Gesch\u00fctze. In vielen R\u00e4umen des Levels befinden sich Pentagramme auf dem Boden. \u00dcber diese k\u00f6nnen nun die bisher immateriell herum schwebenden Geister in Form eines der drei, anfangs gew\u00e4hlten Monster erscheinen. \nAuch dies ist mehr oder weniger dem Zufall \u00fcberlassen und kann mit unter schwer zum Nachteil des armen Tropfs, der gerade den Helden spielt, ausfallen. Sobald ein Monster, oder ein Blob, im Raum erschienen ist, wird dieser versiegelt und kann nur wieder verlassen werden, wenn der Held alle Monster erledigt hat. F\u00fcr die \u00fcbliche Abenteuert\u00e4tigkeit, Monster erlegen, erh\u00e4lt dieser auch die \u00fcblichen Erfahrungspunkte. Soweit so normal, aber jetzt kommt bereits eine Besonderheit des Spiels zum Tragen: Die Monster erhalten f\u00fcr den Schaden, den sie dem Helden zuf\u00fcgen, bevor sie das Zeitliche segnen, \u201eBlut\u201c gutgeschrieben. Je mehr Schaden, desto mehr Blut. Sollte eines der Monster es schaffen den Helden tats\u00e4chlich zu erledigen, so wird der steuernde Spieler umgehend in die Rolle des Helden versetzt. Jetzt gilt es sich zu beeilen und die gesammelten Blutpunkte im Itemshop bei einer Art \u201eBuddha\u201c-Statue gegen Geld einzutauschen. Auch hier gilt nat\u00fcrlich: Je mehr Blut, desto mehr Geld. Das Bare kann dann gegen verschiedene Gegenst\u00e4nde, Waffen und Spezialattacken eingetauscht werden. Bereits im Early Access ist die Auswahl immens.\n\n[b]It is not even my final FOOORM. Der Endgegner[/b]\n\nDie Helden steigen durch das Besiegen der Monster nach und nach in den Stufen auf und werden st\u00e4rker. Ab Stufe 10 kann der Held, sofern er sich stark genug w\u00e4hnt, \u00fcber den Portalraum zum Bossgegner teleportieren und diesen herausfordern. Auch hier gibt es wieder eine Besonderheit: Anders als bisher, spielt nicht jeder der Geister sein eigenes Monster, sondern alle drei steuern den Bossgegner zusammen. Momentan gibt es hiervon leider nur zwei, aber die haben es in sich. Als Beispiel soll hier mal das \u201eDing\u201c aus dem Sumpf mit dem illustren Namen Kourok dienen. Dieser ist zwar bewegungsunf\u00e4hig, sitzt aber sch\u00f6n gem\u00fctlich in seiner Sumpfpf\u00fctze und ist nicht auf normale Art vom Spieler zu erreichen. Gesteuert werden bei ihm die beiden \u00e4u\u00dferen Tentakel, wobei eines eine Art Schleim verschie\u00dft, der Schaden macht und das andere eine Blase, die den Helden gefangen h\u00e4lt und fast bewegungsunf\u00e4hig macht, sowie der ein\u00e4ugige Kopf, der einen vernichtenden, aber recht schwer zu zielenden Strahl verschie\u00dft.\nDas Herausfordern des finalen Bosses geht dabei insgesamt und f\u00fcr alle Spieler geltend bis zu drei Mal. Fordert ein Spieler den Gegner zum letzten Mal heraus, bedeutet das, dass der Durchlauf beendet ist, egal wie nun der finale Kampf ausgeht. Besiegt der menschliche Held den Gegner so entflieht er dem Dungeon und geht als Sieger hervor. Verliert er beim letzten Mal, so geht er als Verlierer aus dem Durchlauf hervor, w\u00e4hrend bei den anderen ein Ranking abh\u00e4ngig von den Erfahrungspunkten stattfindet.\n\n[b]Monsterevolution, Darwin mal anders[/b]\n\nEntscheidet sich ein Spieler ein Level zu beenden, indem er hinabsteigt, erscheint ein Bildschirm, bei dem sogenannte Vitae verteilt wird. Diese h\u00e4ngt etwas undurchsichtig mit den Stufen der Helden zusammen, die im Level erreicht wurden. Benutzt wird sie dann, und hier kommt der interessante Part, um die drei Monster in einer Art Evolutionsbaum weiterzuentwickeln. So wird aus dem bisher schwachen Skelettkrieger ein Bogensch\u00fctze, aus dem kleinen Auge, dass blaues Feuer verschie\u00dft am Ende gar ein \u201eBeholder\u201c. Der Baum hat hierbei ein um das andere Mal Abzweigungen, die verschieden Monster hervorbringen. Das Ende der Evolution sieht momentan, bis auf bei einem mit Patch 0.4 nachgelieferten Monster, allerdings immer gleich aus. Die Motivation es zu erreichen, schm\u00e4lert das nicht im geringsten. \nDie St\u00e4rke des Spiels liegt also ganz klar beim Multiplayer, denn es geht doch nichts dar\u00fcber seinem Mitspieler kurz bevor er schwer geschw\u00e4cht den Raum verl\u00e4sst, noch einen Blob vor die Nase zu setzen und ihn am Besten noch damit zu erledigen. Der Multiplayermodus ist momentan nur lokal an einem PC m\u00f6glich, aber das soll sich in Zukunft auch \u00e4ndern. Eigentlich macht das aber nichts, denn so ein Couchcoop ist auch mal wieder eine erfrischende Erfahrung.\n\n[b]Die Steuerung[/b]\n\nDie ist simpel und serh gut gelungen und l\u00e4sst sich nahezu mit allen m\u00f6glichen Eingabeger\u00e4ten verwenden. Tastatur, Maus und Gamepad habe ich angetestet udn alles lies sich vern\u00fcnftig bis sehr gut steuern. Die Maus hat leichte Vorteile.\n\n[b]Grafik und Atmosph\u00e4re[/b]\n\nEs wurden wunderbar die Effekte und die Optik alter Arcade Klassiker eingefangen. Die reinen Braunt\u00f6ne st\u00f6ren damit nach einer Weile auch \u00fcberhaupt nicht mehr und gerade die Sounds lassen einen das Gef\u00fchl haben mitten in einer Arcade Hlle zu sein. Passend dazu kann man das Spiel auch auf Arcadeautomaten abstimmen. \n\n[h1]F\u00fcr ein Fazit und f\u00fcr ein Videoreview besucht bitte folgenden Link:[/h1]\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUJ991RzdBs", "timestamp_created": 1425022360, "timestamp_updated": 1425037655, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.853698", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "14671898": {"recommendationid": "14671898", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058152876", "num_games_owned": 161, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1077, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467339196}, "language": "english", "review": "If all that they do is add some more bosses and items, and have online multiplayer (please, please please) and MAYBE work some more with the moster tree, this game would be complete", "timestamp_created": 1425016923, "timestamp_updated": 1425016923, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "14670137": {"recommendationid": "14670137", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048896119", "num_games_owned": 75, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 12526, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 35, "last_played": 1513736378}, "language": "english", "review": "An excellent rogue-lite dungeon crawler with frenetic fun and chaotic fights.

Why not try?\n\nSo, here's how it goes, you like to have your friends over and play games, you recently purchased an extra controller to play another awesome local multiplayer game, but its quickly becoming boring and you need some variety. (In my case this game was castle crashers.) So, I went on game jolt and saw a banner advertising this game, I decided to buy it.\n\nCrawl is a great game in many regards, a fun art style, polished gameplay, surprisingly bug free for an early access game, and constantly changing how you play. A typical round of crawl will go like this, you pick a deity to worship. (This will determine what monsters you get and will give you bonuses as well, ex: shop discounts or extra monster health) And you and you friend(s) spawn in. One of you will be the hero, the others will be the ghosts. The goal of the hero is to kill the other players when they become monsters on pentagrams and get XP to fight a boss when the player reaches level 10. The ghost's goal will be to kill the hero using an assortment of monsters, traps, and cunning. When the ghost kills the hero the ghost takes the hero's place. But, that may be hard as it goes for being a pixelated monster with 3 hit points. So, usually how it goes in my experience is the hero stays the hero for the first dungeon. Anyways at the end of the floor, the monsters will get upgrade points for their monsters depending on how much the hero leveled up. (Monsters also get blood when damaging the player, this will be important later.) So, the next round starts with the ghosts having new, upgraded monsters, and the hero still hasn't gotten enough gold to buy any new items from the shop. The monsters steamroll the player and thus a new hero in born. The new hero can then go to the shop to buy upgrades, weapons, and abilities, by exchanging the blood he/she got for hurting the hero for gold. Crawl Goes like this until one of the heroes has reached level 10, and can challenge one of the two bosses currently in the game, although I'll save those for a surprise, then the round is over. But at the end of each round new weapons, traps, shrines, monsters, and deities are unlocked to keep the gameplay fresh between rounds.\n\nSo all in all: Do I reccomend crawl?\nYES\n\nThe pixel art, gameplay, monsters, spells, and updates keep the gameplay exciting and every couple of months or so the devs' release a HUGE update with new bosses, evolutions, traps, balances, and weapons.

seus primeiros passos. Os motivos pelo qual eu comprei esse jogo foram dois: O trailer fant\u00e1stico que me atraiu mais do que deveria e a ideia de poder jogar um Co-op competitivo completamente inovador (a pixel art perfeita foi um ponto tamb\u00e9m que me atraiu).\nQuando o jogo lan\u00e7ou e eu o joguei pela primeira vez (com 3 amigos), ele foi tudo que eu esperava que seria para um jogo em Early Acess, ainda faltavam coisas, mas poxa, ele estava jog\u00e1vel do jeito que eu esperava! Estava super divertido e tinha bastante fator de replayability, jogamos umas 10 partidas naquele dia. Depois de um tempo ele foi enjoando cada vez mais, e por fim, deixamos ele de molho por uns 2 meses.\n\nPassado esses dois meses eu me lembrei \"poxa, e o Crawl? Nunca mais jogamos!\", ent\u00e3o eu chamei meu irm\u00e3o e a namorada para jogar um pouco mais, e CACETA, o jogo tinha mudado completamente! Haviam muito mais Gods, tinha um novo Boss, mais coisas para desbloquear, que que \u00e9 isso???\n\nDeixe-me ir diretamente ao ponto que eu quero chegar. A empresa que est\u00e1 fazendo Crawl, n\u00e3o fez simplesmente um bom jogo, ela est\u00e1 fazendo o que todos esses jogos em \"Early Acess\" devem fazer, ou seja, CONTINUAR TRABALHANDO NO JOGO. Possuo uns 10 jogos em Early Acess na Steam que lan\u00e7am atualiza\u00e7\u00f5es quase que imperceptiveis e demoradas, enquanto Crawl est\u00e1 melhorando cada vez mais!\n\nTl;dr: O jogo est\u00e1 \u00f3timo e a empresa dele \u00e9 super esfor\u00e7ada, est\u00e3o lan\u00e7ando cada vez mais atualiza\u00e7\u00f5es e o jogo \u00e9 super divertido, recomendo 10/10 comprarem ele! (Eu senti que ele \u00e9 um pouco enjoativo depois de jogar V\u00c1RIAS horas, por\u00e9m, com a quantidade de \"unlockables\" ele acaba tendo um fator de Replayability muito bom!)\n",

At the beginning of a game, one of the players is randomly selected to be the \"Human\", the final bosses can only be defeated by a human.

It is the best trailer for any video game I have ever seen. Don\u2019t worry I\u2019ll wait.\n\nNo seriously, watch it.\n\nIf you have no idea what kind of a game Crawl is, let me tell you\u2026\n\nCrawl is a four player local co-op dungeon crawler. One player is the Human and the other three are the Monsters. Simple concept. Amazing execution.\n\nYou might be thinking, \u201cOne guy is the Human? Sucks for the other three!\u201d Not really.\n\nI\u2019ve had the game since Early Access release (August, 6th 2014), and in that time I\u2019ve learned this game is fun by yourself, but it shines when you have four living breathing people to play together. It is a lot like Super Smash Bros: great by yourself, but best with friends. And it\u2019s completely possible to have a wonderful time never even playing as the Human. The Monsters are that interesting and fun.\n\nAs the trailer showed (seriously you should watch it), when a monster kills the Human their \u2018Humanity\u2019 is transferred to the killer. Just like how gold is awarded in DOTA, rage upon last hit stealing is also included, which ensures everyone is going to be the Human at least once per playthrough. And as the Human player(s) level up, everyone else gains \u2018Vitae\u2019 which is used to level up your Monsters, ensuring there is always a challenge. \n\nIn some cases, Human players will take an early lead and level up too quickly, causing the Monsters to scale up faster than the player can cope. Meaning at level 10, Humans might have a similar experience to a player at level 1 (they can still get their teeth kicked in with relative ease). There have been many cases in which I\u2019ve skyrocketed to level 6 or 7 and suddenly I\u2019m fighting all 2nd tier Monsters with starting gear. This usually ends how you would expect; weeping in the fetal position. \n\nThe only way to actually gain gold is to draw blood as a monster. Mechanically speaking, that means damaging and/or killing the Human. This creates a desire to play as both the Human and the Monsters. The only way to improve your Human is, ironically, to hurt and kill other Humans. Many times I have thought \u201cI wish I had blood\u201d whilst doing my best to prevent the others from taking my Humanity. In my experience, you almost always feel like you\u2019re about to die when playing as the Human. And when playing as the Monsters, you\u2019re working with your friends one minute and then actively working against them the next. The fluid nature of the cooperation in this game is amazing. There is nothing else like it.\n\nThe main goal of the game is for the Human player to reach level 10 as quickly as possible, find the Eldritch Stones, and challenge the boss. If they win, they win! If they lose? They have to continue further into the dungeon with about 1/10th of their HP. After a total of three loses, the current Human loses the game. They\u2019re \u2018CONSUMED FOREVER,\u2019 and the game deletes their account.\n\nDark Souls would be proud.\n\nThere is never a dull moment when playing Crawl. Whether you\u2019re the Monsters or the Human, there is always pressure. If you wait too long, the Spirits will collect ectoplasm and summon blobs on you. There\u2019s nothing worse than fighting tooth and nail to get through a room only to have all of your buddies summon nine blobs to finish you off.  \n\nTrying to fight three other players who are working together to kill you but against each other to kill you first\u2026 is very hectic. And with so much happening on screen, it can be difficult to keep track of who and where you are. For the most part, it isn\u2019t too hard to parse your position. It\u2019s definitely harder to find yourself after you\u2019ve lost track than it is to lose track in the first place. Perhaps something like an aura with your color could be added? \n\nLosing yourself aside, Crawl has an incredible lo-fi feel, while still letting you know it\u2019s a modern game. The sprites are evocative of older games, yet they still feel fresh, new, and lively. The animation is fluid. The colors are deep and have good contrast (Thanks to the v0.3 Plague Mushroom update, released 1/15/15). Seriously, this is some of the best pixel art I\u2019ve experienced. \n\nAlso the music is superb. That\u2019s all I really have to say. It\u2019s great.\n\nOverall, Crawl is an exceptional game with great gameplay, amazing art, and outstanding music. It\u2019s simply dripping with flavor. Powerhoof managed to cram so much style into a \u201csimple\u201d game. It is refreshing, fun, and one of the best $10 games I\u2019ve ever had the privilege of purchasing. \n\nBuy it and play it with all of your friends.\n\nThe dudes over at Powerhoof are going places. They have created such a great game and deserve more recognition.\n\nAnd, seriously, that trailer was amazing.\n\nLike this review?

Hopefully for the better, because I don't see how this game can get any worse.\n\nIn this 1 v 3 player game, there is only hero meant to save the world, until his jealous ghost friends stop him. The game fluidly changes from one human fighting off 3 ghosts who summon all manner of atrocities and thirst for his blood, to three \"friends\" partially wanting to help each other kill the human, but at the same time all those friends are just backstabbers.\n\nWith only a dodge roll and sword to start with, dodging traps, buying equipment, crawling through dungeons, leveling up and fighting monsters controlled by other players (unfortunately, unless you are smart enough to just play with bots), playing as the human means juggling three different, unpredictable enemies and traps controlled by jerks who hate you and your life. \n\nIt takes a certain amount of out-of-game problem solving to defeat/overcome the people pretending to be your friend: sometimes your opponents will say their strategy out loud to communicate to each other, but are they speaking in code? Are they trying to use reverse psychology on you (I mean the corner is totally a vulnerable spot right?)? Should you try to con them or will they see right through you? Are they whining about not playing as the human to trick you into losing? Can you just unplug their controllers or throw something at them? How good are you at throat punching? Should you practice throat punching more? Probably. All of these strategies take some serious pondering.\n\nOn the business end of the human's bloody sword, playing as the three ghost is intense and gratifying. You can summon and possess all manner of colorful monsters with different play styles and strengths. At the end of every level you gain sweet, sweet hero's blood in order to upgrade these various monsters from lowly skeletons and rats into demon lords, dragons, and beholders (among others and more to come). When not completely wrecking your friend the hero's day as fiendishly awesome monsters, you can ruin your friendship by obliterating them with traps and summoned blobs that auto-attack but can also be possessed. \n\nWhile you are happily torturing the poor human you are becoming best friends with your other two friends who aren't a lame human: you are communicating strategies through eye blink Morse code, you are yelling out fake strategies to throw the human off, you are playing dumb to catch them off guard, you are probably even fake-choking to gain the upper hand. All is great, until you realize the human isn't your only competition. And when you realize that everyone in this house sucks at the Heimlich maneuver.\n\nNow you know that those other two bastards are trying to take your rightful kill from you. What the hell is up with that? You were best pals just a second ago, you were like siblings, but now you deserve to be human and they aren't letting you. Now you have to try to trick the other players out of the kill by assuring them that you aren't going to unleash a fountain of fire in order to take the kill, maybe you pretend to miss all of your attacks right until that last sliver of health is begging you to take it.\n\nThen one of two scenarios happens: you get the kill and start the cycle of 1 human v 3 ghosts all over again, or someone else gets the kill and you kick them out of your house and refuse to speak to them again.\n\nI don't recommend playing Caustic Relationships And Wretch Losers (C.R.A.W.L.) unless you want to be alone. If you are already alone, the bots aren't so bad. At least they aren't a bunch of backstabbers. You can always count on red to be your friend....\n\nSeriously though, Crawl, at a most basic level, is incredibly interesting. Part co-op, part competitive, and all fun. It covers a wide audience range by being finely tuned for accessibility while still remaining flexible and deep enough for more serious players to give each other a good challenge. I eagerly look forward to all of the tuning and content updates will bring.\n", "timestamp_created": 1422228361, "timestamp_updated": 1422228361, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 35, "weighted_vote_score": "0.639441", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "14166453": {"recommendationid": "14166453", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080963539", "num_games_owned": 165, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1709, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509814244}, "language": "english", "review": "Review Written on 25/01/2015 (Subject to change) Scroll for Pro's,Cons and Summary.\n\nDo you cherish your relationship with your friends?\n\nTHEN DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!\n\nCrawl was made  with the intentions of turning even the strongest of bonds in to heated rivalries; One moment you will find yourself working with others to lower the heroes health, the next you're viciously scrambling to ensure you are the one who delivers  the final blow to take his place.\n\nCrawl offers that which seems to be a rareity in modern games: 4 player local multiplayer. Bringing back the golden days of real couch co-op. The game practically comes gift-wrapped in nostalgia, with its retro-arcade visuals,8-bit audio, two-button combat system and fast-paced gameplay.\n\nGameplay:\n\nTo begin with, you are greeted with an \"Insert coin screen\" where you must create a character name consisting of three letters. As simple as it sounds, it immediately welcomes you.\n Players  must then  select a god to worhsip. Each offering three different monsters with their own evolution path and starting conditions.\n\nThe premise is simple; One player starts as the hero, who must reach level 10 by descending floors to defeat the boss and claim salvation. \n\n Sounds easy eh? \n\nThis would be the case, if you didn't have three other players , in ghost form, competing to become the hero in the process, by possessing traps, summoning monsters and deploying slimes. This makes survival as the hero extremely difficult, even more so as the other players gain \"Vitae\" a currency used to evolve their monsters each time the hero levels up or they draw blood from him.\n\nFear not though! All is not lost, as each floor contains a blacksmith, where the Hero is able to spend gold they have accumilated through killing monsters, to purchase new weapons, trinkets and powers . However, getting to the shop first on each floor is essential if you want to claim all the best gear before anyone else.\n\nThis is where Crawl really shines, it offers a sense of progression. The amount of purchaseable gear is satisfactory, and even after death, any itmes purchased are not lost.  The monsters don't lose out either, as between floors, players are prompted to evolve their monsters, becoming stronger and increasing their chances of killing the hero.\n\nNow, let's discuss one of my favourite aspects of the game: \n\nBosses.\n\nOnce players have reached level 10, they are able to face a boss, should they choose to do so, by entering the boss room and standing on a glyph. However, you can only have one attempt at the boss per floor, and three overall between everyone. This is when things become interesting, as you need to ensure you are well equipped for the battle, but have to accept the fact that persuing better gear always comes with the risk of dying and not becoming the hero again, allowing others to face the boss. \n\nHere's the brilliant part; Once the boss fight begins, any player who is not the hero is able to possess one of the bosses body parts such as the arms and head. Each limb will have a different attack, meaning cooperation and coordination is essential.\n\n If the hero prevails, the player wins the game, If the hero is to fail, he will be sent back to the floor with little health and the game continues. If all boss attempts have been used and the hero dies on the final attempt, it's game over. The winner being decided by whoever has accumilated the most XP during the game...Oh and the hero's character is permanently lost, although there seems to be no real penalty for this as there is nothing tying you to your character post-game. You can literally create another character with the same name straight after. To counter this, me and my buddies came up with a system where if your character dies, you can no longer use that three letter name again. Not much of a loss, but better than what the system currently offers.\n\nWith the completion of each game, win or fail, you earn unlocks. Wether it be new traps, new evolutions for your monsters, weapons , tomes etc.... This adds to the games already enormous amount of replayability. (After 15 hours of play I still haven't unlocked everything!)\n\nMechanics:\n\nThe game plays best with a controller, although a mouse and keyboard is entirely useable. The two-button system is easy to use; you have a primary and secondary attack and a stick for movement, although the mouse can also used for movement; your character will move to where the cursor is pointed. I found the mouse a little more tedious and difficult to use as opposed to the gamepad.\n The fighting system is easy to understand, the difficulty comes from avoiding attacks and timing.  Personally, I'd like to be able to carry a ranged and a melee weapon and have another button to switch between the two.\n All in all, due to the simplicity of the controls, combat feels fluent and tight, with the animations complimenting and completing the system. \n\n\nMultiplayer:\n\nBe prepared for cursing, shouting, physical violence and possibly a heart attack-enduced death as you work extremely hard to bring the heroes health down only to have a friend steal the kill and become the hero. \n\nThis game is best experienced with friends. You can of course play solo, the A.I is more than capable of providing a decent challenge, and is surpringly believeable, making human-like errors. But local couch multiplayer is the heart and soul of this game, and besides, there's no better feeling than defeating your friends and claiming salvation.\n\nUnfortunately, at the time of this review, Online multiplayer is not currently implemented. This is a shame because me and my buddies aren't always together, and we'd love to get some Crawl on when this is the case. Fingers crossed though!\n\nAnother feature I would love to see in this game is Steam Workshop intergration. I'm sure modders would have a blast creating massive amounts of content. This would no doubt increase the lifespan of Crawl.\n\nGraphics and audio:\n\nCrawl is certainly a pretty game. From the intentional graphical glitches at the main menu, to the colourful displays of attacks ,traps, monsters and blood spills. The pixelated aesthetics feel right at home and sit comfortably amongst the haunting 8-bit track that accompanies them. The randomly generted dungeons  can get a little samey, but there is enough diversity to keep things interesting and the developers have confirmed that dungeon generation, music,  monsters, traps, items and a whole plethora of content will be added. \n\nIssues\n\nNaturally, being in early access, Crawl is not without it's flaws; Ghosts being dragged too quickly from the last room into the next when the hero is running through them, sometimes resulting in the inability to utilise a room filled with traps.

Great music and visual imo. Gameplay is in a top down dungeaon crawling game. Main advantage it has is that it is very different compared to other couch multiplayer games. One person is the \"hero\" whilst others are ghosts going down levels of a dungeon. \nHero\nThe aim of the hero is to level up to level 10, activate the portal and defeat the boss monster. The hero can also buy stuff from the black smith and store including weapons, buffs and special ability items. \nGhosts\nThe aim of the ghosts is to kill the hero and therefroe become the new hero. They do this by possessing traps and activating pentagrams to become monsters in the dungeon. The ghosts get viae points by other heroes leveling up to spend on evolving their monsters. Their is a good variety of monsters as of v0.3 with more to come. When the monsters hurt the hero they earn blood which they convert to gold to buy stuff when they are the hero.\nBoss\nOnce a hero reaches level 10 they can activate a portal on a dungeon floor, with each floor's portal only allowed to be activated once, to fight the boss. The boss is controlled by the ghost players, eg one boss hass two tentacles and a head  making three control points and one boss has three different heads. If the hero dies they are shunted out. The boss can be fought three times total in a match until the games end.\nNO signs of online multiplayer anytime soon but I don't mind as the game has decent AI and I prefer them spend time adding more environements, creatures and bosses.\n\nIn the end I would recommend this game if you want a multiplayer game such as towerfall, samurai gun, gang beasts etc mixed with dungeon crawling rouguelike gameplay and assymetric multiplayer like evolve or nintendo land games.", "timestamp_created": 1421700064, "timestamp_updated": 1421700064, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "14071387": {"recommendationid": "14071387", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019310218", "num_games_owned": 163, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 269, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484934419}, "language": "italian", "review": "Great game.", "timestamp_created": 1421697082, "timestamp_updated": 1421697082, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.540885", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "14055813": {"recommendationid": "14055813", "author": {"steamid": "76561197986617621", "num_games_owned": 9632, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 587, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491999299}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is seriously awesome.

Very, very fun.  Any criticism I have is in no way a deal-breaker.\nPros:\n- Balance: Lots of attention seems to be paid to keeping it interesting w/ the power dynamic between players constantly shifting.  Getting your minions' butts kicked? You'll rank up monsters faster. Spent a bunch of time running around as the hero killing everyone else? Now you're reincarnated as an toothpick spitting inchworm. All this is done without feeling like it's simply picking on the person in the lead.\nADDITIONALLY, the end-game is satisfying regardless of outcome since everyone both worked for and against it the entire time.\n- Pace: I'm impressed how well it allows for a leveling and item system while still keeping the gogoGOGOGO!GO!GO! mentality.  There always seems to be something for everyone to be doing.\n- Mood & Atmosphere: The glitched out voice acting brings me right back to scratchy copies of Golden Axe played on poorly tracking TVs.  Pixel graphics can be an aquired taste, but I think it fits well and this game puts a cool spin on it (this kind of \"possessed game cartridge\").\n\nCons (somewhat minor, but I hope can be addressed as the game develops )\n- Player confusion: With the unsaturated color palette it can be easy to lose track of your player.  This gets harder during big brawls when some people may be controlling the same type of minion.  Regardless, the learning curve is small.\n- Advancement & Unlocks: As it stands, the item and \"God\" unlocks after a session seem arbitrary.  Currently, they seem to be coming out of the glitched-out ether of the game (which is cool mood-wise), but it might be nice to see as least know what's triggering them - Are they indeed random? Tied to playtime? In-game exploration?\n\nI've only played this a few hours but it is already well worth the price - for the single player experience, let alone the strong party game this is!", "timestamp_created": 1421421609, "timestamp_updated": 1421421609, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "14009244": {"recommendationid": "14009244", "author": {"steamid": "76561197979598684", "num_games_owned": 53, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 310, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1422233057}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome gameplay.\nSexy artstyle.\nExtremely friendly creators.\nThoroughly recommend.", "timestamp_created": 1421405859, "timestamp_updated": 1421405859, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "14006533": {"recommendationid": "14006533", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060076508", "num_games_owned": 1097, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 3661, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501909880}, "language": "english", "review": "Of all the games I can possibly recommend, I recommend this the most highly for friendly get-togethers.

Just two years ago I thought it was dead.  In the last two years tons of games have come out exclusively for couch coop.  I heard about this game awhile back and had yet to pull the trigger, well I finally did.  I can safely say it doesn't dissapoint.  TBH I have yet to actually play couch coop with someone I have just played against bots.  I will revise my review once I have played it with buds.  Everything about the game is brimming with style, from the flashy menu, to the incredible pixel art, tight controls, unique gameplay, and the intense chiptune soundtrack.   Early access gets alot of flak but this is done right.  The Game is released in an EXTREMELY playable state with a very large update looming ahead.  Grab some buds and Crawl, I know I will be soon!\n\nEDIT: Just played with 3 people and one bot.  it was a blast!  I was surprised at how simple it is to pick up.  :)\n\nEDIT 2:  This is now the 5th time I have brought \"Crawl\" to an all night lock-in.  I purposely go out of my way to find couch coop games on Steam.  I have a set of 4 wireless x360 controllers (and four wired for crazy 8 players sessions in other games) I use for parties.  I have never seen a game get so much playtime.  It is a shame Steam doesn't log offline hours because it has to have a ton.  There isn't a single couch coop game on the face of the planet that has so much depth and a sense of progression in a party setting.  Games can last about anywhere from 30-60 minutes if not longer.  Each player becoming more and more invested.  This is Powerhoof's first game and I am ecstatic to see what they create next.  The gameplay is so incredibly fresh, the art astounding, and the sound design superb.  If you have IRL friends made of flesh and blood, get Crawl.  I love the online multiplayer experience as much as anyone, but I yearn for the classic days of local multiplayer.

Not sure what my play time will show on my account but I've played more than it will show. We own a ton of games in this genre. The local co-op, retro, throw everyone in the ring and fight each other type games. Stuff like Towerfall, Samurai Gunn, Gang Beasts, Nidhogg, BroForce Deathmatch, etc. Theey're a great style of game for when you have friends over. Everyone can grab a controller and get right to the fun. No wasting time. Crawl adds to this genre in a big way.\n\nThe concept is pretty genius. 1 player controls the hero while 3 other players control ghosts which can \"pocess\" traps and mobs while the hero runs from room to room in the dungeon. The fun exists because the hero needs to kill the monsters to collect XP and level up. Once he gets to 10 he needs to find the portal room and portal to the boss. At which point the 3 other players take pocession of different parts of the boss and try to take out the hero and send everyone back into the dungeon. The catch comes when a ghost kills the boss, he then becomes the hero and tried to level up his hero to 10. There are many other things to consider while leveling. Finding blood and turning it in to merchants sos you can buy weapons and spells and potions. Ghosts collect points to level up the monster they can transform into in certain rooms in the dungeon. \n\nThe whole game put together keeps everyone engaged and in it to win it not matter how far behind. First time playing my guy hit level 10 first but I never made it to the boss through the portal room. Another guy made it to the boss several times and died. The guy who ended up winning was in last the entire match. \n\nI generally do not do EA but this one is a gem. This one should be fun to play for a long time as long as you have some people around to play with.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/Cj8nZXmg8UY", "timestamp_created": 1421022377, "timestamp_updated": 1421721171, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.981901", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "13946571": {"recommendationid": "13946571", "author": {"steamid": "76561198146937253", "num_games_owned": 39, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 235, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1428097212}, "language": "spanish", "review": "le falta un modo online y ya esta!!!", "timestamp_created": 1421003009, "timestamp_updated": 1421003009, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "13934212": {"recommendationid": "13934212", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005179729", "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 4401, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509238629}, "language": "english", "review": "The game of the gods.

Up to four players can play at a time. 1-3 play as the spirits inhabiting the dungeon, and they attempt to destroy the Hero who is trying to conquer the dungeon by controlling traps and summoning monsters. The more blood from the Hero that each spirit spills, the more they can offer to the gods in exchange for gold. Once the Hero is defeated, the spirit who delivered the killing blow now takes his place. The new Hero can take all the blood spilled from the old hero as an offering and receive gold which can buy new items like weapons, spell tomes, potions, armor, and charms. This essentially leads to a race for level 10 as the Hero. However, at the end of each floor, for each level the Hero has risen, the spirits are given points to level their monsters. Whom ever can level their hero form to 10 can open the portal to the final boss, Kurok. Kurok can be controlled by all three spirit players simultaneously, and will provide and extreme challenge to the Hero with weapons like toxic sludge, trap bubbles, and a humongous eye laser. Each run of the game, no matter who attempts to defeat Kurok, there can only be three attempts to defeat Kurok before he unleashes his wrath upon the world. If all three attempts fail, Kurok will break lose, and all players lose. The lowest scoring player of the game has their in-game profile permanently erased.\n\nWhilst I still have not unlocked every God in the game, this has become my favorite party game ever. When you find yourself smiling at the person who is playing Hero, saying to them \"I'm definitely going to kill you\", it creates a special moment. This game has created the most friendly gamer rivalry I have ever experienced. The localized experience that the players get is absolutely incredible. It does not take long to understand how the game works. Then, after about 8 hours of  play, the participants can still find themselves discovering new items popping up in the blacksmith shop.\n\nI still find this game incredible, and I've recommended it to many friends.

But by that time player who got ahead first early pretty much kept a mile lead.\n\n[b]Postive notes about the game:[/b]\nThe game has a small decent variety of weapons/spells/items, as you play the it through a couple of times the game unlocks more items/mobs/spells you can use in the next game which keeps it interesting. Mini-bosses are fun to play as.\n\n[b]Somethings I would tweak about the game.[/b]\nTraps slightly more visible for players (it's mostly for the ghoul's benefit.)

Lava bits! Water world. (Different wall sprites, it does get monotonous after 11 floors to see the same green decaying stone walls.)\nHolster/switch weapons?

After several hours of playing I have not once experienced a single crash or significant bug. The fighting is also incredibly balanced and the player and monsters never feel ridiculously powerful or impossible to kill. you never die from a cheap shot and every bit of damage you take feels like you could have avoided it. it has a very Dark-Souls-Esk feel to the combat, its fast, fluid, responsive and satisfying and you never feel punished for dying.\n\n Additionally, if you have no buddies to play with the, AI is superb, acting much like a human does in how it moves, fights and decides to buy items (pausing for a brief moment to think). having the choice to alter the amount of players (from 2 to 4) is great and acts as  a subtle way of modifing the difficulty in addition to the AI also has a difficulty modifyer.\n\ncontrollers also have complete compatability, very literally plug and play. either it be a 360 or ps3. (I cannot confirm for other controllers, but it seems to be the case)\n\nbut when you have 4 controllers, the computer hooked up to the big screen and a few beers around, this game absolutely shines. even in alpha this game is honestly brilliant.\n\n\nBUGS\nThese are the only bugs that I have noticed thus far (and they are pretty minor ones at that).\n\n1. as a ghost you can fly around the map collecting ectoplasm. when you collect enough you can spawn upwards of 3 slimes to enter the field at any time. they are weak, but can certainly be an effective distraction, causing surprising damage if not delt with. \n\nThere appears to be a spawning bug, you can place them anywhere on the field  however placing them too close to a wall or corner will result in them getting stuck and unable to move. This is no problem as they are easily cleaned up and the game can continoue, but this will probably be quite easily fixed in later versions.\n\n\n2. The AI. while acting pretty reasonable most of the time and are certainly a worthy challenge (I am yet to win a watch against simply 2 AI on normal, I cant imagine what 3 on hard would be like). \n\nthey do, ever so rarely get a little confused if there is alot of gunk on the floor. As they try to avoid it they end up running over it multiple times and take significant amount of damage figuring out how to behave (but they do snap out of it eventually) . yet, so far, this has only happened maybe 2-3 times in the many matches I have played and only seem to last for that room. its a rare occurance and will probably be patched at a later date.\n\n\nbut apart from that.....nothing of mention, the game is very well polished. very easily worth the asking price.", "timestamp_created": 1416616693, "timestamp_updated": 1416616693, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502873", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "13028876": {"recommendationid": "13028876", "author": {"steamid": "76561197962359165", "num_games_owned": 65, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 134, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1465001558}, "language": "french", "review": "Voila un concept que j\u2019attendais depuis longtemps !

Even in single player mode playing against bot enemies!\n\nSo if you like couch coop games, I'd definately say \"go for it!\".", "timestamp_created": 1416459105, "timestamp_updated": 1429279179, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516620", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "13001832": {"recommendationid": "13001832", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040926429", "num_games_owned": 104, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 1860, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492449455}, "language": "english", "review": "My friend became so O.P. he one to two hit our fully leveled monsters but he was so slow it took him a good 15 seconds to enter and leave a room.", "timestamp_created": 1416376668, "timestamp_updated": 1421027495, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503206", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "12999458": {"recommendationid": "12999458", "author": {"steamid": "76561198033008814", "num_games_owned": 86, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 529, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492292774}, "language": "english", "review": "gorgeous pixelart graphics\nawesome chiptune soundtrack\npickup&play controls\ngenius gameplay mechanics\npriceless local mp moments\nextrafun in singleplayer too\n\n\nreally worth the money", "timestamp_created": 1416355138, "timestamp_updated": 1416355138, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "12990890": {"recommendationid": "12990890", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017381248", "num_games_owned": 929, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 362, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486533682}, "language": "english", "review": "HELL YES!

Crawl itself has a crazy simple design, looks and feels like an old arcade game (only 2 buttons, and one stick) I played with a controller and loved it (haven't yet tried the mouse). As simple as it was on paper, playing the hero took some work (monsters actually felt more responsive and intuitive, controllwise, than the hero), aiming ranged weapons took finesse, and missing a special or crucial attack because the target was moving around was heartbreaking, but  each time I moved to deny either my friend or the AI my precious humanity was a moment of absolute triumph. The cutscenes between hero death and the new hero entering the game gave the unfortunate loser a chance to exclaim thier losses, while the winner exclaimed thier victory.\n\nThe Games basic premise is refreshing, with 4 players all competeing for the chance to be a hero and defeat the boss. The switch off between being the hero, a monster, a trap and a ghost was enjoyable. Best moment was when I realized that the final boss was also controlled by the ghosts, and I took great pleasure in shooting my friend with a simple, but really enjoyable array of attacks. The ghosts will need to work together to take down the hero, because although they outnumber him, most of the time the hero has more health, and often does more damage (depending on monster level), when an AI hero battle began my friend and I would quickly talk strategy and each try to exploit the hero's predicament in order to land the final blow ourselves.\n\nThe chaotic and quick pace that ensued was enjoyed by all, and even though we didn't win the match, simply playing the game was enjoyable.

The kind of experience that makes you want to arrange an in-person handshake. The gameplay is moment to moment satisfaction: your attacks make big loud noises whenever you smack a foe around, making the whole experience incredibly active. Not to mention the thrill of negotiating when to dodge, when to attack, what monster to take out first and what traps you THINK you can jump over. And all the while, big bright numbers are popping up whenever you score a hit, level up, collect gold, etc. The music builds and travels around you in a way that makes you feel like you're traveling further and further into something dangerous. Unlockables always make you want to play a second match, and there is an amazing amount of variety here for just ten dollars. All of the monsters and their evolution chains will bring a whole new slant to the way you fight, with some creatures bringing straight-up entirely NEW mechanics to gameplay that are exclusive to them. There's only one monster that can summon low level zombies. Only one monster that can heal itself and other monsters. Only one monster that can summon a gust of wind to move the hero into the path of a trap. Only one monster whose eye can be used as a weapon after you kill it! Bottom line, when love is behind the making of a game, you can tell right away. And the result is bombastically fun. Mighty fine balance that gives advantages to both being the ghost and being the hero, with both roles always presenting opportunities that will permanently better a player's position. The final boss is gorgeous and puts up a fight that will make you chomp your lip and raise your fist. This whole game will make you chomp your lip and raise your fist.

The concept, gameplay and art style were all so fresh and unique that I was immediately hooked by this game. There are too few games in the world today that evoke the same emotions as the quest involved in playing a round of Crawl with your friends.\nFirstly, as an early access game, I was astonished when I picked this up because I found little to no glitches or bugs and it was bursting with content right from the start. The community is also very much alive and the developers are simply phenomenal, always keeping you updated as to their progress and ideas for the game. \nThe gameplay is like nothing I've ever played with up to 4 players playing locally (3 as ghosts and one as a hero) attempting to become a level 10 hero and defeat the dungeons boss. The catch is that since there is only one hero at a time, if you are not playing as the hero, you are one of the 3 ghosts controlling the dungeons minions, traps and bosses attempting to kill the hero and whomever deals the killing blow becomes the next hero.\nGames are generally fast-paced and frenetic yet the overall game round can take up to 30-40 minutes to play through depending on the players experience levels. The fact that the game is truly semi-cooperative in nature at all times is wonderful and keeps player interaction high. This is what makes local multiplayer gaming so wonderful to me and Crawl really delivers on that front. Many gamers have argued that they wished this game offered online support, and while I understand that not everybody has the opportunity to play with 4 players locally I really don't think this game would deliver the same experience if it were being played with people miles away on the internet instead  of your friends and family on the couch next to you.\nWhile I absolutely love this game and how unique and just plain fun it is the one major frustration for me would have to be the fact that the monster who deals the killing blow becomes the next hero and not the monster who dealt the most damage or some other qualifier. This just seems unintuitive, unfair and unrewarding to the non-hero players and I really think this should at least be an alternative option for the game settings if not the standard. I have discussed this with other gamers and while I understand their points as to how making it the player who deals the last blow can work as a balancing mechanism for weaker players I've seen it create just as much imbalance and more importantly change the flow of play to where camping is encouraged for monsters so that they can prepare themselves to deal the killing blow instead of simply attack the hero relentlessly. I truly believe that there should at least be an alternative option available in the settings for the monster who dealt the most damage to become the hero because I find it silly for a game to inherently make one of its mechanics just frustrating for the players  and immediately turn them off the excitement.\nDespite my one major criticism I have seldom found a game whose development has excited me as much as this one and I really hope that the developers consider my opinions on the game. Overall Crawl is definitely a game worth checking out for any gamer who wants to experience a new and exciting type of game and I highly recommend it if like me you are a huge fan of local multiplayer games that appeal to that childhood sense of playing arcade games and other video games side to side with your friends and family before the lonely Online Gaming era.\n", "timestamp_created": 1414435280, "timestamp_updated": 1414435280, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "12652017": {"recommendationid": "12652017", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079205455", "num_games_owned": 119, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1205, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467696773}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is great!

This makes ranged monsters/heroes feel uncontrollable at times. I would like to see some more content, such as new monsters and equipment, as well as maybe a couple of new traps.

We had 4 players, 2 with xbox controller, 1 with the xbox controller from the guitar hero drumkit and one (who despises controllers) on the keyboard. First they made the mandatory jokes about the pixely graphics and how it made their eyes bleed, but in the end the gameplay really made up for it. \n\nSo, in this rogue-like game you are an adventurer trying to survive a maze of rooms and monsters (your friends) on a quest to defeat Kurok, the final boss. So while you are making your way through the rooms, your friends control incorporeal ghosts that can spawn monsters and possess traps. In some rooms pentagrams appear that allow a ghost to materialize into one of his monsters (randomly chosen) and try to gain back his mortality by defeating the hero. The one who delivers the final blow gets to play the hero.\n\nOverall, everyone got to play the hero for a while.. except me. But that's actually not a bad thing! Once you reach the trapdoor of a floor you get to the next stage and before starting, every player can upgrade his monsters. You get upgrade points (or \"vitae\") based on how many levels the other players gained, which means that if you didn't get to play the hero, you should get a lot of vitae to make your monsters a lot stronger. I really like this mechanic, but it didn't work out that well for us, since my friends still had pretty strong monsters as well (until I got the dragon, muahahah).\n\nWith 4 players the game is pretty intense and we had a great laugh. I really recommend playing this game couch-coop.", "timestamp_created": 1411896940, "timestamp_updated": 1411896969, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "12270278": {"recommendationid": "12270278", "author": {"steamid": "76561197965620293", "num_games_owned": 310, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1005, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512206731}, "language": "english", "review": "Pros:\nHero has various choice of weapons and utilities, and demons have various choice towards upgrading demons.

There is character progression, adversity which shifts constantly as other players take the role of the hero and the others take the role of the monsters trying to turn him into floor paste and some great bosses which allow for some nice action.\n\nOverall, a solid concept. Now the reason for the no recommendation;\n\nI played local multiplayer with a bot or two (not having more than one other person immediately available) and the result was a frantic scrabble after the AI, trying to figure out what to do. This itself did not take long, but the frantic scrabble continued on and on and on. Normally, frantic in a game is good, but this just felt like always playing catch-up and never progressing. At the end of each floor, regardless of character advancement, it always felt like we were not quite sure what had been achieved, what happened or what we were even trying to do. We continued on for a while, had a few boss encounters and played as both the monsters and hero a few times each. It was around the time my friend said \"I'm bored\" that I realized that I was too and had just been forcing fun onto the session.\n\nThe ghost characters constantly felt like they were dragged from room to room, rather than chasing the hero, often never having the chance to even attempt the various awesome traps in the corridoors between some of the rooms. The blob drops were a nice touch, enabling the ghosts to stay in the action, but not overwhelm the hero too much with mobs. But it still felt a bit bland and it was hard to relate to any of the characters with the constant control switch (mostly with the AI bots getting in there 9 times in 10). Overall, for two of us playing with two bots, it was not fun.\n\nOther people with three friends to play with may very well have an awesome time with Crawl, but I think it needs a little more balance, maybe some humor or something, anything to bring it to life. Players need something to work with to get fun out of a game. Other than that, the devs have done an awesome job (love the boss intros, they looked awesome!) and I hope I get chance to have fun with this in the future.", "timestamp_created": 1411856421, "timestamp_updated": 1411856421, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 111, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.649445", "comment_count": "8", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "12265242": {"recommendationid": "12265242", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010801254", "num_games_owned": 182, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1738, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492645344}, "language": "english", "review": "Very fun and unique game for a very low price.

Upon taking the role of the human you are thrust into a dungeon filled with traps and monsters all controlled by people you may or may not know and must fight until you win or die trying. Upon death you become one of three ghosts seeking to end the life of a man in order to claim his humanity, during your quest you may choose to work together as you possess monsters and traps but ultimatly you all strive to be the one to deliver the final blow in order to claim a chance at sweet deliverence.\n\nTLDR: It's a fun multiplayer game where you all beat the shit outta eachother. Unlike other multiplayer games with a small player limit , such as a infamous one which may or may not involve italian plumbers having parties, the game balances power based on how much damage you deal, how much the player has leveled up, and ultimatly makes it feel like you always have a chance to take the game. All in all this game is amazing.", "timestamp_created": 1410743267, "timestamp_updated": 1410743267, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "12092069": {"recommendationid": "12092069", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063508389", "num_games_owned": 63, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1205, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1412810028}, "language": "english", "review": "My first impression of the game while watching the trailer was that the dungeon was filled with monsters that you could take control of as a ghost and the summoning circles were used to summon more powerful monsters. Boy I was wrong. The circles are the only way to summon monsters except for slimes that you can drop as a ghost if you collect enough orbs that float around the screen.\n\nI made the mistake of playing the game with three bots my first go. I was lost the entire game as the bots were too fast to keep up with what was going on most of the time leaving me clueless on how to play the game even at the game over screen. I came in third place and only managed to become a human once as the bots constantly got the last hit on the human after I managed to wear him down.\n\nThe second play through I played with one other person and things started making sense. I finally realized I can summon slime, which I may have been doing before but things were so chaotic I didn't know what was going on.\n\nOverall, you should play the game for the first time with 2 players or 1 bot to get the hang of it. While this isn't the best way to play the game, it's easier to learn the ropes.  The more players (once you know what you are doing) the more fun this game becomes.\n\nDespite my misconceptions of the game, I still find it enjoyable especially as a party game with friends.

It has to be one of the best multiplayer games I've ever played. The game mechanics work seamlessly together to create an experience that had me and all of my friends on the edge of our seats with excitement several times over the course of four or five playthroughs. It's rare that we find a game that keeps us so excited for so long. \n\nDespite a fairly simple set of mechanics, it manages to keep up the intensity by constantly finding ways to up the ante. The spirit players are consistently evolving their monsters into more powerful forms, but the hero is always gaining more levels and buying loot. Then, when the hero dies the cycle continues for another player. By the time a hero is getting close to level 10 (the required level to fight the boss), the spirits probably have at least one of their monsters at peak evolution--and the peak evolution monsters are almost all bad-ass hero slaying machines. By that point, every encounter is a desperate scramble to see who can hit level 10 first. The players trade off constantly, each getting their turn to be the hero.\n\nEven when someone does hit level 10 and face the boss, the spirits control the boss's various limbs. Good teamwork and coordination can make it incredibly difficult for the hero to succeed; it becomes an intense struggle between the spirits and the hero. Good thing you get 3 chances to beat the boss... but those 3 chances are shared between all players. Some of the most intense moments I've had playing this game came from close calls during the boss fight, but some of the dungeon's rooms can be nearly as treacherous as the boss fight when controlled by good spirit players.\n\nThe game keeps things fresh by (I think) randomly generating the dungeon's levels every time you play, along with randomizing the loot you can buy from the store. Every time you play, you get new options, and every time you finish a game you unlock new evolutions, traps, or loot. One of the first unlocks is a laser beam trap that we all came to dread greatly when playing as the hero (and love when playing as a spirit). That thing is awesome. You can even unlock new gods to worship (well, only one right now but I imagine they plan on adding more), which open up new monsters and new evolution paths for your monsters.\n\nCrawl managed to entertain 7 fickle friends for several hours, even though only four of us at a time could play. It was intense enough and fun enough that it was OK to have to be sidelined, because even watching your friends play is a fairly decent experience.

Definitely don't recommend playing with one or alone.\n\nGameplay is like a lightweight, realtime, roguelike, and features one-of-a-kind coopetition. One player starts out as the human, and the others are ghosts trying to kill the human. The ghost that scores the killing blow becomes the human. As the humans level up, the ghosts get to level up as well. The more damage you do to the human (read: the longer you spend as a ghost) the more money you can get by praying to a shrine. With these mechanics the game is amazingly self-balancing.\n\nDo well as a human? Well your ghost is going to be very weak. Finally get to be a human after a long time as a ghost? Go to the store with your oodles of cash and buy the best gear.\n\nGames last between 45min to 1.5 hours. Completing a game unlocks new shop items and ghost abilities to keep you coming back for more.\n\nReally looking forward to what else they add to this game!", "timestamp_created": 1409339260,

\"Wow, this actually looks pretty fun!\"\n\nSo, thinking back to that video, I decided to try and find it. Lo and behold, it was on Steam! I immediately bought, noticing it had a single-player feature as well, something that appealed to me, since I don't have the best Internet in the world. After the fast download, I played it for the first time.\n\nWow! I had seen gameplay for this game on Youtube, but I never thought it would be soo much fun! Even against the AI, the game itself has a simple yet challenging playstyle to it that I love, and the music and graphics match so well with the action the game can offer!\n\nI have few complaints, to be honest. Normally, I would have a number of them, seeing as this is Early Access, but I only have a few. \n\nFirst, it just seems so short. Eight floors just seems so small for a game. But it is in Early Access, so I could understand why.\n\nSecondly, while I enjoyed what I saw so far (I managed to play the AI into losing his Humanity, which was satisfying), maybe adding different kinds of surroundings, like mossy dungeons or dark, dank caves would be possible. It'd be interesting to see how a fight against a mindflayer (or hentai tentacle beast, either way, they're pretty interesting) would go in a cave with floor-to-ceiling rock formations here and there.\n\nAnd lastly, the weapon selection. While the weapons are useful in different situations, it just seems kinda boring to swing a sword or throw some daggers around. Maybe adding a bow or possibly a staff is possible? It'd certainly change how players played the game.\n\nAll-in-all, this is a great game to play with your friends. Everyone is involved in not just the dungeon-crawling levels, but also the final boss, which was pretty interesting.\n\nI've never seen a game like this before, and I'm very much looking forward to seeing how much more is going to go into this game!\n\nEDIT:\n\nAfter playing the game a few more times, I realized that it DOES include other weapons, as well as other monster elvolutions. My bad for not playing more of the game and securing my knowledge. All it takes is a completion of the game as either the human or the spirit, and those new unlockables are given to you before heading back to the main menu.\n\nEDIT 2:\n\nI'm forgetting or overlooking quite a bit in this game, apparently. I recently discovered a spirit-usable statue feature, which allows spirits to become strong, high-level monsters that would normally be available through monster evolution. It's a pretty interesting concept, and one I kind of dread. A low level player can quickly be eradicated by one of these monstrosities, but the battles are tense and hectic. \n\nAs for other features, I noticed that there are a number of other weapons that are unlocked through continuous play, such as javelins and clubs.

All the items are super fun to combine and it's been fun seeing how long I can go with certain monsters without having to evolve them, and things like that.\nSome things I'd think would be awesome if they were added:\n-A Campaign: As fun as it is to grind through with a bot accosting me at every room, I would really enjoy some plot. It would be really cool if I was able to save my level and my items that I have at the time, and continue through the dungeons and such. I would definetly log a lot of hours on this game if such a thing were to exist.\n-Gods: I'd like to kind of have a plethera of gods to choose from, with all their different minions and monsters. I'd also like to see some use of the actual gods themselves-- there are pictures of the gods, but no real reason to know what they look like. They're just a face. It would be really cool if there was a point in the game (of even a gamemode) where you get to play as the god you chose, and get to unleash your special kind of hell on your enemies.\n-Heroes: As it stands now, when playing with four people, one person is pitted against three ghouls who get to try their best to rip their friend a new one. It would be nice to have some 2 v. 2 action, or maybe (when there's three players) two heroes and a ghoul. Just something to change it up and put it more in the players hands.\nIn addition to the Heroes suggestions, maybe you could have different hero types, or characters. Something to vary the gameplay. \nIt would also be pretty cool if people could submit their monster, item, and hero designs to 8bit-ify and have in the game. \nPretty much like workshop. \n\n\nJust some ideas I've had while I've been playing-- I'm sure that half of what I've said are things you guys are already considering or even working into the next update.

No nos enga\u00f1es, sabemos de tu secreto, pero no tienes de qu\u00e9 avergonzarte, que aqu\u00ed todos estamos a la par. Como friki sotanero encubierto que s\u00e9 que eres, no puedo dejar de recomendarte este peque\u00f1o juego.\n\nLo que nos propone es desde luego interesante, partiendo de los preceptos b\u00e1sicos del tan manido g\u00e9nero de la espada y la brujer\u00eda subterr\u00e1nea, se saca de la manga un sistema de juego verdaderamente atractivo: Mientras un jugador controlar\u00e1 al cl\u00e1sico h\u00e9roe, con el objetivo de derrotar al temible engendro del averno de turno\u2026 los dem\u00e1s jugadores participar\u00e1n como las bestias y trampas que pueblan la mazmorra.\n\nCuando no eres el valiente aventurero, manejar\u00e1s a un esp\u00edritu que tiene la capacidad tanto de controlar los mil artefactos repartidos por cada nivel, como invocar su propio ej\u00e9rcito personal de engendros de diverso pelaje. \u00c9ste es seleccionado al comienzo de la partida, y a lo largo de \u00e9sta puede evolucionar con un interesante sistema de repartici\u00f3n de puntos: Cuanto m\u00e1s evoluciona el h\u00e9roe, m\u00e1s puntos tienen los dem\u00e1s a su disposici\u00f3n para ponerle las cosas m\u00e1s dif\u00edciles. El que logre derrotar al h\u00e9roe, pasar\u00e1 a tomar su papel y a enfrentarse a sus antiguos aliados. Las traiciones est\u00e1n a la orden del d\u00eda, y no siempre va a ser m\u00e1s rentable colaborar entre todos los esp\u00edritus, porque al final s\u00f3lo uno ser\u00e1 el vencedor.\n\nLos niveles se generan de forma aleatoria, as\u00ed como la disposici\u00f3n de las trampas y puntos de invocaci\u00f3n. Cuando se alcanza el d\u00e9cimo nivel, si el jugador que controla al h\u00e9roe se siente afortunado, puede intentar derrotar a la temible bestia que espera al final de su aventura. Estas fases son muy entretenidas, controlando cada jugador una parte diferente del monstruo (Sus dos brazos y su boca), haciendo de esta fase final un reto verdaderamente complejo.\n\nPosiblemente inspirado en el juego de tablero \u201cDescent\u201d (Recomendad\u00edsimo), este sistema es terriblemente adictivo, sobre todo cuando hay m\u00e1s amigos involucrados (Hasta cuatro simult\u00e1neamente).\n\nCrawl es esa clase de videojuego que parece predestinado al \u00e9xito en esta santa casa. A saber:\n\nGr\u00e1ficos pixelados precios\u00e9rrimos\nUna jugabilidad \u201cDe la vieja escuela\u201d: Con dos botones lo haces todo\nPropuesta interesante, con un multijugador asim\u00e9trico bastante innovador\u2026\nSin embargo tiene una serie de fallos que deber\u00e1n corregir antes de la versi\u00f3n definitiva para ganarle la gloria eterna de nuestro sello de \u201cRecomendado\u201d.\n\nEl principal desde mi punto de vista es el desequilibrio que existe entre el h\u00e9roe principal y el resto de jugadores, sobre todo al alcanzar la fase final. Existen tres intentos para derrotar al jefazo final, fracasando en el \u00faltimo se pierde autom\u00e1ticamente, incluso yendo toda la partida en cabeza. Es una verdadera l\u00e1stima, porque el resto de elementos est\u00e1n calculados a la perfecci\u00f3n para que las partidas sean igualadas hasta el final.\n\nSi bien cuantos m\u00e1s participantes la acci\u00f3n se vuelve m\u00e1s divertida, tambi\u00e9n se vuelve ca\u00f3tica en la mayor\u00eda de los casos, sobre todo para jugadores menos experimentados. No estar\u00eda de m\u00e1s incluir alg\u00fan tipo de marcador extra sobre cada jugador para saber en todo momento d\u00f3nde nos encontramos.\n\nSe echa en falta un modo multijugador online, que aunque nunca igualar\u00e1 la experiencia de compartir este juego codo con codo, es una posibilidad interesante que quiz\u00e1s deber\u00edan contemplar.\n\nEl \u00faltimo reto que deber\u00e1n abordar en esta fase final del desarrollo es el ajuste de la inteligencia artificial. El nivel dif\u00edcil es demasiado dif\u00edcil, el normal demasiado f\u00e1cil. Hasta aqu\u00ed puede ser una cuesti\u00f3n de gustos, pero el comportamiento es muchas veces err\u00e1tico, qued\u00e1ndose atrapados en trampas relativamente sencillas pereciendo sin remedio. La experiencia est\u00e1 tan pensada en el multijugador que su experiencia en solitario desmejora completamente.\n\nA\u00fan con estos defectos, la propuesta de Crawl es s\u00f3lida y contiene los ingredientes para convertirse en un grand\u00edsimo juego, sobre todo para jugarlo en compa\u00f1\u00eda. No he tenido el placer de probarlo con mando (Es compatible), pero seguro que la experiencia mejora y mucho, a pesar de que los controles \u201cNormales\u201d (Con teclado el jugador uno, con rat\u00f3n el segundo, no admite m\u00e1s jugadores simult\u00e1neos sin mandos), aunque algo extra\u00f1os al comienzo, est\u00e1n perfectamente ajustados.\nSu grandeza reside en la capacidad de ofrecer diversi\u00f3n instant\u00e1nea a lo largo de cada partida (Que durar\u00e1 una media de 30 minutos) para cualquier tipo de p\u00fablico. Para ello, me propuse probarlo con un amplio espectro de jugadores a los que psicoanalic\u00e9 rastreramente sin su consentimiento en lo que participaban de mi experimento. Mis conclusiones son las siguientes:\n\nBorja Molina \u2013 Maestro inalcanzable\n\nContra este tipo no ten\u00eda demasiadas posibilidades. Que no hay manera oye, su capacidad de aprendizaje al teclado dej\u00f3 hace muchos a\u00f1os de ser humana.

Puede que incluso en el nivel m\u00e1s sencillo resultase un poco dif\u00edcil para su edad, pero Crawl es una forma excelente de divertirse en familia y de paso, adoctrinar a los m\u00e1s peque\u00f1os en el camino que tanto nos apasiona: El del ocio digital.\n\n\u00bfLograr\u00e9 engancharla del todo alg\u00fan d\u00eda?

Being a fan of both roguelike adventure games and oldschool 8 bit action and never being able to get my fill of either, this game stopped up the hole in my soul. Competitve game fan? This is totally for you. Friendships have almost been ruined. I've made my girlfriend's little brother rage quit several times  (claims Berserk is op, wants you to remove it. plz dont.) The huge amount of unlockables keeps me coming back for more. The variety in weapon animations, awesome/funny monsters (huge fan of the \"flash my tentacles from under my robes\" mind flayers :D) and interesting spell/item mechanics to keep everything spicy in the dungeon. \n\n I know this is the earliest version of early release, but I have a few polish suggestions for you guys.\n\n If you could add twin-stick movement support for game pads that would be awesome. As it is now there are specific advantages that mice have over keyboard/gamepad, and vice versa, namely a full 360 degree aim for  mouse players and  ease of movement for kb/gp. I suppose for some people without game pads it wouldn't be as fair, but I would just as well go out and buy two more so everyone at my pad can enjoy perfect aim and movement. \n\n Another thing, somewhat building off of the last suggestion is within the Kourok boss fight. Along the bottom of the screen to the left is a blind spot where, unless a mouse player is taking control of the eye beam, you cannot hit the challenger whatsoever. Perhaps you could add a scrolling left/right adjustment crosshair instead of the five direction spread for the eye beam? That way every section of the screen can be blasted with the beam. \n\n Besides that as of now, I don't have any complaints. I don't think balance is an issue seeing shops/levels/monster spawns are all random, and everyone has access to the same types of spells/items/weapons/monsters. It's a perfect balance of luck/skill that allows a player to excel if they perform well, but can still be thwarted with a bit of teamwork and quick thinking from the ghosts.\n\n I can't wait to see how you guys expand on the dungeon aesthetics, more colors/props/texture and whatnot. If I could give any suggestions/requests on this, I think it would be interesting to see the dungeon floors randomized like the Infinite Layers of the Abyss from Dungeons and Dragons Grayhawk cosmology. Instead of having the floor's identities set in stone, just have the decor and name reflect each other and randomly generated (ie, acid themed floor \"The Acrid Hive\" or flesh walls/floors \"Hall of Goosebumps.\") Another roguelike game that has this element somewhat is a bullet hell  called Shoot First. Music reflecting the decor would be awesome too. \n\n And one last request.. please implement a monster that's like the Devil from Heroes of Might and Magic 3 http://www.heroesofmightandmagic.com/heroes3/h3px/archdevil.gif\n\nThey are able to enter a burst of flame and teleport across the battle grid... maybe area damage when enter/exit the flames? The scythe would be awesome flavor too.\n\n Thanks for reading!~", "timestamp_created": 1408228075, "timestamp_updated": 1408228075, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "11744418": {"recommendationid": "11744418", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034176343", "num_games_owned": 281, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2308, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486469711}, "language": "english", "review": "Thought it can be a lonesome crawl with the lack of online multiplayer, \"Crawl,\" even in Early Access form, is a goldmine of local multiplayer value that shouldn't be missed.\n\nIn Crawl, you and 1-3 other players are all trapped in a dungeon guarded by a gargantuan monster. One of you will be a human fighter while the others are relegated to existing only as insubstantial phantoms. The hero is free to exlplore throughouth the dungeon, delving deeper into its catacombs as necessary to continue on in hopes of treasure, merchants, or a teleporter which can take the hero to the final boss room and either freedom or absolute destruction. As the hero moves from room to room, however, the phantom players can and will do everything they can to kill the hero, from possessing a variety of traps and summoning helper slimes to, most essentially, manifesting in the physical forms of any manner of beast from bear-trap summoning goblins to centaur archers to formidable gazer demons more than capable of slaying would-be-heroes. In the event that any phantom does kill the human opponent, they themselves will procure that player's humanity, spawinging as their own mortal fighter. This is the key pattern of the gameplay, with the hero being rewarded with experiencing points and the chance to purchase rare treasures from merchants nestled within the dungeon catacombs, while the phantoms are rewarded with stronger monsters and blood, which can later be turned into gold should they attain human form. The essential goal is to reach level 10 as the hero and, with the aid of an already impressive variety of unlockable weapons, potions, spells, and other items, reach the teleporter room instanced on each floor of the randomly generated dungeon and face the final boss in combat. The phantoms can possess parts of the boss's body to aid in the assault against the hero in an all-or-nothing battle. With victory, the hero is rewarded with freedom, but, should the hero be slain by his friends in his final assault, his name and likeness will forever be cast into ashes.\n\nThis game is still a work in progress but is still an easy product to recommend because all of the fundamental features and gameplay mechanics are already quite functional, entertaining, and polished. The core gameplay of killing your friends and becoming stronger in doing so is well-polished and, a few Early Access hiccups aside (including a lack of variety as of the time of this review and a forgivable level of question of balance with certain elements) is absolutely addicting in it's fast-paced flow of action, chance, and reward. \n\nThe game is themed well with what could be called a haunted-arcade vibe that keeps the visceral action light and helps the player appreciate the charming and beautifully rendered retro-style graphics. While the look could understandably be considered \"played-out\" to some extent, in the current indie environment, but the atmosphere cast over the room by the up-tempo horror-midi soundtrack is both appropriate and exceptional.\n\nWith flawless controller support, easy-to-grasp yet hard-to-master brutal combat, quick 20-60 minute gameplay sessions and great mood I would absolutely recommend \"Crawl\" to any gamer who lives with other gamers or plays often with others in the same room. \"Crawl\" has no online support whatsoever and, while the bots are functional and helpful if you have less than 4 people, playing alone feels like more of an empty practice session at best. This game is just a blast with friends that you can easily show someone whose never played before a controller and play well into the night without becoming bored, and that's only with the content available as of this very early access build.

Runs absolutely perfectly, with brilliant gamepad support using steamos-dkms xpad drivers.[/i] \n\nI have a soft spot for local multiplayer, and so I tend to add to basket as soon as I see a game tagged in this way. This review starts by saying that Crawl is potentially one of the best local multiplayer games I've played for a while. \n\nI played this game last night with my sister and parents (3 gamepads and myself, the unfortunate soul with the keyboard). I know we'll play again tonight, its that kind of game. Each time you play it begins like this, someone starts up the game, everyone taps their respective controller and occupies a slot, which the game cutely refers to as inserting a coin. You enter a 3 letter name, or choose a previously used one. Then you select a deity to worship (as of writing this review there are 3 deities; two instantly available and 1 unlockable). Your choice of deity decides what sort of beasts you can manifest yourself as to hinder the current hero. [b]The game begins.[/b]\n\nThe current hero is selected randomly from the up-to-4 players, and attempts to crawl through the dungeon as far as possible, amassing gold, buying new items and buffs. All the while, the non-hero players attempt to kill the hero by either manifesting as monsters by activating pentagrams that are one the floor of some rooms, \"going-poltergeist\" and possessing traps or turrets, or summoning slimes that they can stockpile by collecting dust. The non-hero player that kills the hero player gets to continue where the previous hero player left off, albeit without his buffs and items, these have to be collected individually. The object of the game, which you can only progress towards during your time as the hero, is to reach at least level ten so that you can open the boss portal, and defeat the boss. Aside from this the game has intervals everytime a player descends to a lower floor. During these intervals players receive [i]vitae[/i] points for everytime an opposing player levelled up on the previous floor. They can use these points to evolve their selection of beasts, making them stronger and a greater threat to opposing heroes. \n\n[h1]Why I like it so much[/h1]\nThe game offers a simple but very replayable mechanic. The non-hero players work together to try and kill the current hero, but ultimately want to beat the others to land the final blow and secure precious flesh-and-blood hero time. The current hero works to improve their items, spells and buffs so that they can fight off opposing players for longer. The struggle is fast paced, skillful and very fun. After level 10 players have the chance to nab the winner's position by choosing to fight the boss, but they only get so many chances, otherwise they finish last. As more bosses are implemented into the game, the risk of entering the boss portal will become even more interesting; what if its a boss you don't like and you only have one chance left? Maybe you should level further? But what if one of your opponents goes through? \n\nSo so fun. \n", "timestamp_created": 1408097017, "timestamp_updated": 1408097017, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "11711336": {"recommendationid": "11711336", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006011933", "num_games_owned": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 189, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502209035}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game, can't wait to pllay it with MORE friends in the same room.\nGameplay using 4 wireles XBox 360 controllers, worked beautifully, the game even survived my laptop going to hibernate due to low battery - restarted and Crawl was waiting at the menu to resume.", "timestamp_created": 1408088910, "timestamp_updated": 1408088910, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "11710777": {"recommendationid": "11710777", "author": {"steamid": "76561197969542779", "num_games_owned": 1857, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 588, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499243436}, "language": "english", "review": "[EARLY ACCESS REVIEW: \n\nSo far this game absolutely lives up to it's trailer.

So far I've been playing it for about an hour and here are some of my first impressions:\n\nGameplay: The gameplay itself is very sleek and smooth. Crawl resembles that of a button mashing arcade figher, which isn't a bad thing. There are two buttons you use to attack (primary and special) which just feels very satisfying. The concept itself is original as well, and that's something I haven't seen in quite a while. It's almost like a multiplayer dungeon crawler King of the Hill RPG. \n\nYou battle your friends who are attemtping to kill you in order to revive themselves as humans and collect randomized dungeon loot along the way. If you or any of your friends finish off the human, they revive and then have their shot at completing the level. As the ghost characters, you take control of items and can summon monsters which you can evolve. At a certain point along the way you gain enough experience to fight the boss battle. Admittedly, the boss battle did come a little quickly and I had beaten the game before I knew it. However I noticed I unlocked a few items, so I know that coupled with the randomly generated levels means replayability is implied.\n\nArt Style: I'm also a fan of this art style which is what first caught my eye. The animations are smooth and the characters are well drawn. I've never been the type to complain about pixel art as if it were an excuse to \"real art\"; it looks great. The only issue is I find myself backing away from the monitor to get the full view of some text which is otherwise a little difficult to read from up close.\n\nMusic: About what you would expect, pretty catchy but has a few points where it appears to stutter.\n\nThis game is in early stages, and it looks promising. So if it's good now, it can only get better.\nIt's only $10 right now so there's really nothing to lose by giving this a try.\n\nI suppose the only thing I'd like to see a network multiplayer. And I understand the naivity of most people who make that statement and don't understand that networking isn't an easy task, but I could see this game being a blast at LAN parties and with friends who don't want to crowd around one screen or use mutliple controllers.", "timestamp_created": 1407894434, "timestamp_updated": 1407894434, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.974450", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "11681071": {"recommendationid": "11681071", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995542475", "num_games_owned": 293, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1180, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1471395669}, "language": "german", "review": "This game is a lot of fun but If this would get online multiplayer, this would be pure EPICNESS!", "timestamp_created": 1407879102, "timestamp_updated": 1407879102, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502238", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "11678852": {"recommendationid": "11678852", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987356335", "num_games_owned": 165, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1970, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498959819}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is fantasitc.

The concept combined with the incredebly well done trailer and the fact it took less than 24 hours to be greenlit (not to mention, only two people were on this project) hooked me right from the start! I waited in anticipation for roughly 7 months (other people have waited for 2-ish years), so you'd expect that there would be A TON of hype, and I'm telling you right now, that all of that hype did not exceed that which this game deserved. To be completely honest, this is the most fun I've gotten out of ANY multiplayer game ever. This is an early access game, so it isn't finished (even though it's pretty much flawless in my opinion). They're going to be adding so much more content that I think may surpass the $9.99 value (which I feel is a perfect price for how much content there is currently). I urge you to consider supporting these two fine gentlemen in their quest to make the ultimate game (which may increase the chances of online multiplayer).\n\nEDIT: Just thought I should add a few things based on what i've learned and also on the new update that came out a while ago.\n\nI think it's imperative that everyone knows that the devs are actively interacting with the community on a weekly basis and sometimes more often than that. They are two very well mannered gentlemen that love to hear your ideas and definitely take every one of them into consideration. They actively post updates on development weekly and, like I said before, sometimes more often than that. There is promise of a trove of content that I'm pretty confident will come!\n\nThis update that came out in September practically doubled the content and they almost nailed the ballance on some of the earlier monsters from the first early access build. Just a few ballance issues with a few monsters from this new update need to be worked out, but that's hardly a concern of mine with devs as dilegent as these.\n\nI should also note that the community that has been formed around this game is quite lovely and the people in it are very creative! Right now (Nov-december 2014) there's tons of excitement surrounding the release of a new update coming towards the end of December that includes a brand new boss and some other valuable content and the devs have maintained 100% transparency as far as their progress on the implimentation and testing of said boss and content. (aside from surprises that they wish to keep a secret). So you can just head on over to the forums and check that out. Drop in some suggestions if you'd like! (aside from Online Multiplayer, the devs have heard that over and over and over again) We'd love to have you!\n\nEDIT EDIT: A lot has happened! A new boss has been added, new gods, more secrets, a new environment, and a wealth of monsters. They've added game changing mechanics and features that really change up where the game goes and can really shift the outcome of a match. They revamped the color pallet so it looks really nice and pretty now. Barney and Dave have really pulled it out in these last few months and have done nothing but improve the game and its value!\n\nEDIT: Been a while. We've had quite a few updates since I last updated this review. Added a few monsters, traps, features, etc... I'd say my opinion hasn't changed at all.

how the game works and then information about how my kids of various ages interact with the game.\n\n-- How it Works -- \n\nThe game is gorgeous and we all really love how it looks and sounds. \n\nUp to 4 players play locally (2 minimum). 1 person plays as a human, the other 3 play as ghosts. The human is seeking gold and experience. Once the human grows up to experience level 10, they make go into a special realm and fight a final end-boss. If they win against the boss, they are the dungeon survivor.\n\nThe ghosts, on the other hand fly around grabbing orbs. Once they collect enough orbs they're able to drop simple slime monsters into the map. If ANY monster is in a room, then the doors lock and the human must slay them. In some rooms the ghosts may be able to use Monster Symbols to take control of a larger monster and directly fight against the human. In some rooms, the ghosts can possess traps and trigger them against the human. If a ghost kills the human, they come into the game as the human and the dead player returns as a ghost.\n\nHere and there you'll find a shop where you can upgrade your spells, weapons, or passive abilities.\n\nThe entire purpose of the game is to play as a human long enough to get to level 10, then escape the dungeon by killing the boss.\n\nWhat's really fun, is that you only get 1 chance to fight a boss monster per dungeon floor. If you fail, or are not a high enough level, then you most descend further into the dungeon before you can try again. Between each floor in the dungeon, the players can exchange the power they've gained (granted when the human levels up) to evolve their selections of monsters, to effectively increase the difficulty of the next floor of the dungeon. \n\nThis is definitely a lot of fun.\n\nThe final boss is a large beast that 3-players can take control of simultaneously against the human. If the players are on point, it's VERY HARD.\n\nWith only a few players, this game is very very simple. With 4-players actually trying to do a good job, the game is hectic and REALLY shines.\n\n-- Family --\n\nMy 4-year old is a little unsure of the exact goals. But, she does like possessing items in the maps.  But, she gets tired of the game after 1 run-through.\n\nThe 9-year old has it all figured out and she does a great job. \n\nWe really like playing this game 4-player as a family. The 4-year old gets a BIT distracted sometimes. But, overall she's ok. I definitely had to take her through the game a few times 2-player with the explicit purpose of showing her around before she could understand it.\n\n-- Overall --\n\nI can't wait till they add more boss types and dungeon diversity. This game has fantastic style and I trust these developers to make the right decisions for the game.", "timestamp_created": 1407657910, "timestamp_updated": 1407657910, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "11625366": {"recommendationid": "11625366", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058663678", "num_games_owned": 260, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 210, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1415584277}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a great game for couch co-op.

I saw this game on greenlight awhile ago (love at first sight), and I instantly wanted it. this game totally packs a new kind of competitive gameplay into dungeon crawlers. What is this game? it's multiplayer 1vs3 dungeon crawl, where 3 people can be the dungeon masters and one person will be the player; Here is the twist though: Once you kill the player you \"steal\" the players humanity and become the player yourself (the killed player becomes a dungeon master); which is totally new compared to the typical co-op experience you get in rogue-like games.  The goal of the game is to level up and gear up untill you can face the final boss. Whoever kills the final boss or has the most xp will win.  Another cool feature is that you can level up the enemies you can spawn as a dungeon master with a currency called vitae, which is gained by other players leveling up (Very good balancing technique, people who cant kill the player and remain at level 1 will gain more vitae than the others, so they can make their monsters super OP and finally kill the player). You can also collect small brown blobs that charge up the dungeon master's skill, and be able to summon slimes. However this game is not complete, and is still in early access; It also only supports local co-op at the moment (Not LAN co-op, its couch co-op), so For people expecting the multiplayer to be online should wait a little untill the developers can add it.  My score for this game is a definite 10/10, and it is completely worth spending $10 on.\n\nHow can this game improve?\n\n-ONLINE MULTIPLAYER: in my opinion online multiplayer is this game's key to becoming even better. Even if it is peer-to-peer/Direct IP entry multiplayer, it will still be a major step for this game's future. I know Powerhoof said that multiplayer MAY be added later, but I do not feel comfortable with \"may\".  From what I've seen from powerhoof's website this is their first major release, and pretty much all the other games they released were point and click adventures. It's likely they are unexperienced with networking a game, and I dont blame them (I dont know how to add multiplayer to a game). I wish for the best they can get the help they need to eventually break through this barrier and add the feature this game would be perfected with.\n-MORE SPAWNABLE MONSTERS: (maybe make several more monsters with different upgrade trees and have them randomly chosen when you choose which deity you worship).\n-MORE SKILLS FOR THE GHOSTS: The dungeon masters/ghosts skill could be different for each deity (current skill just spawns slimes after you gather enough brown orb things). Some examples: Choosing Murkan gives you the ability to summon red crystals and traps, also blocks all the doors in the room, Choosing S'hrim gives you the ability to summon zombies/skeletons that do poison damage, and Choosing Teok gives you the ability to summon slimes/or maybe dwarfs with red cone hats :P  .\n-MORE BOSSES: (could have them choosen randomly once you enter the boss portal).\nIdeas include: Hydra: it lurks in a cave inside of a pool of water. maybe a plant boss of some sort who can roots come out of the ground and stab the player, (it would be in a forest-like cave).  Another boss could simulate games where you keep running right (the boss tails right behind you as you run) untill the boss is dead (similiar to the wall of flesh in terraria).\n-CAMPAIGN MODE: let the player set the number of floors (10,20,30) before starting. after every 5 to 10 floors a portal will appear that lets you teleport to the boss which will be randomly chosen; after beating a boss in their respective lair a staircase will appear allowing you to continue,at the final floor there will be a giant red door which will lead to the final boss; the final boss will not appear in arcade mode (arcade mode is the original gameplay that you guys can play right now).  There would only be 3 tries for each boss (boss is still controlled by the ghosts (dungeon masters).  The bosses difficulty scales as you continue going down the floors (more health/damage).\n-A POINT SYSTEM: this would be shown on the screen (for campaign mode and arcade mode), to be honest I do not like that the points are completly based on gathering XP which pretty much makes everything you did as a dungeon master pointless (pun-intended).  Points Should be added once you get xp and kills.  Each XP orb gives (1) points, every time the human player hits a monster he gets (1) point, points should also be given for damaging the human player in any room; this system would be similiar to how the blood currency is distributed - Example: 1st - most damage dealt (75)points, 2nd (50)points, 3rd (25) points, 4th - least damage dealt (0)points), killing a monster gives (25)points.\nkilling a player gives(100) points, killing a player with a trap gives (150) points, and lastly \nkilling a boss gives (400) points.  This makes it so that even if you didnt kill the boss you can still win first place. The point counter would be shown at the top of the screen, but would be small enough so that it doesn't block any view of the game.\n[optional] A message could be displayed under the players point interface, announcing why they got the points.\n-DIFFERENT PORTAL MECHANICS: Don't have the portal generate on every floor, and make it so portals dont appear untill floor 5. It's kinda annoying when BOT's fail the boss, and just end up fighting him again on the next floor. Also If a player fights the boss already and loses he should have to wait a certain amount of floors before being able to fight it again (lets say 3) this way it gives the other players a chance to fight it if they are not level 10.\n-MORE TYPES OF TRAPS: (Poison darts, mine launcher, spike floor where spikes pop out of the floor when the ghost activates it, and a trap that shoots out acid that remains on the floor for a bit.\n-DIFFERENT RED CRYSTAL MECHANICS: A higher chance for red crystals to spawn in a room with traps, and a chance for red crystals to Re-appear in rooms if the player were to enter a room he has been in more than one time. (sometimes BOT's tend to run around FOREVER, and traps don't work well if the player can just run through the room which leads to this situation: The second you posses a trap the player has already left the room).\n-MORE ARTISTIC VARIETY: as you go deeper into the depths the floors theme should change. As for what you could do I have a few Ideas. A floor everything is slightly dark and is illuminated by candles (the player and enemies will have a dim glow around them so the players can see where there characters are) The pentograms will also have a red glow. Different themed floors will change the look of the enemies slightly (different colors that match the floors theme). \n-MORE DECORATIONS: Pictures, procedurally generated furniture, knight statues, sword racks, etc.\n-HERO CUSTOMIZATION: this game could have 3 different hero classes. The customization options (vanity) are unlocked after completing challenges (ie: kill 50 enemies to unlock the beholder mask).  You will also be able to choose your class and how your hero will look before choosing which deity to worship (which monsters you will have).\n\nWell This is about everything I can think of that can be added or improved, I hope you can take my review to heart and add these features in the future even if not all of them.", "timestamp_created": 1407636917, "timestamp_updated": 1407783840, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 50, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.786304", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "11622846": {"recommendationid": "11622846", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084804783", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2223, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506831730}, "language": "english", "review": "AMAZING GAME!

Final verdict is that it was definitely worth the wait, with the only disappointment being no online multiplayer (which hopefully comes). The whole concept is every fun and novel, in which all the maps seem to be procedurally generated as you play. One player starts off as the Hero, while the others play as three Ghosts, which have the ability to possess things throughout the rooms... such as pentagrams, for monster summons, and dormant traps, which can be utilized.\n\nThe object for the players is simple: Be the first to get up to XP Level 10 so you can open up the portal to face the final boss and fight for your escape. A Hero earns their experience by killing the opposing players who take monster forms, but there's also a second form of specialized experience, particularly useful to the Ghost players: Vitae. Every time a Ghost player causes damage to the current Hero, they earn this currency, which can be used in a variety of ways, like taking a warp to the floor's shop, pay tribute to an idol for quick cash, or... if you're feeling more offensive... use it to upgrade your monsters. That melee skeleton not cutting it for you? Upgrade it to a bow skeleton for heavier, ranged damage. Being an early access game, I can see there's still plenty more to be made for this game, so I can see this system being expanded on quite nicely. Even better, winning the game makes unlocks more things to use in the game, which helps increase the replay value here.\n\nMy only gripe is the lack of online multiplayer, which could make this game's popularity explode greatly, but even then... If you have four controllers to plug into your PC? Get this... NOW. It's definitely a riot of a local multiplayer party game. :>", "timestamp_created": 1407609974, "timestamp_updated": 1407609974, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "11617456": {"recommendationid": "11617456", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019860212", "num_games_owned": 158, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 815, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1454866848}, "language": "french", "review": "A peine en Early Acces que sa poutre du zombie \u00e0 coup de sainte croix !\nLaisser ressortir vos plus vils instincts et riez du malheur de vos petits fr\u00e8res qui voient leur profil supprim\u00e9 \u00e0 vie en ayant lamentablement \u00e9chou\u00e9 sur le boss que vous contr\u00f4liez :D", "timestamp_created": 1407605525, "timestamp_updated": 1407605525, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504565", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "11617165": {"recommendationid": "11617165", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058136279", "num_games_owned": 419, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 257, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472784407}, "language": "english", "review": "      Wow, what a surprise. I'm not usually one to pick up early access games as I would prefer to play a finished project, but after seeing this on the Humble store, I  immediately fell in love with the pixel/glitch art style. I checked out the gameplay video and decided to give it a chance.\n      Crawl starts up as if it's an old school arcade game, asking you to insert coin and enter you initials. Up to four players can play via couch co-op (no online unfotunately, but I think the fast paced gameplay lends itself better to local co-op) using keyboard, mouse or controllers. One player starts as the human character advancing through the dungeon collecting money, loot or finding the exit to the dungeon. The other three player take control of ghosts who can summon creatures or possess traps in the dungeon with the purpose of destroying the human character. Once a ghost player has killed the human player, they become the human. End game happens once a human character destroys the main boss.\n      As you progress, your character levels up and can buy weapons and equipment that change the way the game is played. In between levels, you can upgrade the monster creatures you send out as a ghost, making the game more difficult as you progress. It's very nicely balanced and I never felt like one player was too strong or weak against other players. While this game is meant to be played with multiple players, I found single player with bots surprisingly challenging, and at times forgot I was playing against the computer.\n      I highly recomend Crawl if your looking for a frantic couch co-op game to play with your friends, or just looking for a fast paced arcade style game to play by yourself.

Go! Now! Take it! Have it! Love it!\n\nCrawl's a short-session action roguelike. It takes thirty minutes or so to play a single round, and win or lose, you'll net new unlocks to change up future crawls. Fast-paced and capable of hammering home a gloriously tooth-grinding need to win, even just against the AI bots, Crawl is exactly what it looked like in that first video that took us all by storm months ago (and if you haven't seen that, watch it at once, it's on this very page).\n\nMost impressive is the game's catchup mechanics. Each player has three tracks of monsters that they level up from lowly worms into terrible dragons, from cackling skeletons into...whatever that giant goddamn black knight thing is, seriously, he's worryingly huge. The \"Vitae\" these upgrades require is earned when your -opponents- level up. That's right: The further ahead one player's human shape gets, the nastier the beasts he'll find himself facing, and those who've been struggling will have the most worrying monsters of all. I was a little unclear on how the game decided what tier to spawn you at, but it seems to have a similar catchup mentality (I saw an AI who was wayyy behind the rest of us spawn as a top-tier dragon twice in a row).\n\nIt does a lot to keep the humanity ball passing around. After reaching level ten (which is not the cap, if there is one), that player, when human, can use one of the portals scattered around the dungeon to take on the boss. If he loses, he's ejected, but gets to stay human (if a human at terrifyingly low life). The game can't drag on forever, though: The third time the boss is engaged (by any player) the portal explodes in a totally metal portal explosion. Defeat of the human player now means the end of the game, a consolation prize for the ghosts and absolute devouring of the foolish human who'd tested his might and failed.\n\nIt all comes together really well. The joyful rage of getting your killing blows on the human stolen by an UNWORTHY GHOSTLY ALLY who hadn't contributed much is palpable, and the satisfaction at pulling apart the creatures as a human and getting your big, glitzy retro levelup effects is real. Both modes of play are fun, which is probably the key factor here--dying sucks, but hey, on the other hand, now you get to be a giant fuckoff black knight and make your friends bleed. And that blood spilled when playing as a monster gets saved up, to be converted into gold when you next find yourself human. There's never a lazy moment: It's constantly important that you be pummeling your friends (or computers).\n\nThere's an almost infinite amount that could be done with this game. Items could be added forever. Alternate bosses, more sets of monsters to pick from, hideous new traps, diversified level pallettes--the paging space is almost numbing. So buy this game!

I'll try to avoid giving out the same details as everyone else, but the praise is well-deserved, this game does a ton of things right! Now, since all the peeps below me have given the game the good stuff, I'll say all the bad stuff I have come across. \nFirstly, the rooms look nice, they really do, but they all look the same, their shapes are different, and that does determine life or death in circumstances, but still, change it up a bit please. Secondly, the game could use some balancing, the starting human starts off at  major disadvantage to the monsters when they inevitably fall and become a monster, they're a super-weak monster (this is an early access, so this'll be fixed sooner or later.). The controls are also less fit for a keyboard as you can only aim in 4 directions, this can be fixed with a controller, but not all of us have those, and it often makes the game a tad more difficult when aiming. The boss also has an unskippable cutscene which after a while made the boss look kind of...Cute, in a derpy fashion...(IGNORE THAT.). \nBesides the above, this game is a great example of early-access done right, and its dev's are fun guys.

Its a casual dungeon beat em up and this game has great potential if or when they decide to add on more to it. \n\nIf you're looking for a game thats new, but feels like a classic this may be the one.

The game features an unique A-symmetrical competitive design where it's a hero against a team of ghouls. Though the ghouls can not directly harm the hero, they can spawn mobs, turn into greater mobs, and take control of traps to hinder the hero's progress. Though the ghouls have the common goal of killing the player, they are still in competition with each other to land the killing blow. To break it down, it's an XP race, and you can't gain XP unless you are the hero, and you can only become the hero if your ghoul lands the killing blow. This dynamic presents some very interesting and unforeseen strategies.\n\nThe game's art, music, and sound design are all top-notch, and worthy of praise. The pixel art is detailed and well animated, while the music and sound design is distinctly 16 bit. Overall the game keeps to it's theme quite well, and it's certainly not too hard on the eyes.\n\nThough the game features some very unique and interesting ideas, and top shelf presentation, it's not with out it's flaws. Currently, as of this impression, the game only features local multiplayer. For a game that is very multiplayer focused, this is a huge sin. Those who have people close at hand, Crawl is an easy recommendation, but if don't, then you have to consider your purchase more. I've played this solo and still enjoyed it greatly, but after a while, bots are bots, and once the gimmick of the unique mechanics is settled away, boredom can eventually set in. I can see how this is much more interesting with live people, unfortunately I never got to experience this very important aspect of the game due to it's lack of online.\n\nOverall all Crawl is a very uniquely designed competitive game that is both engaging and beautiful. Even at it's current early state the game feels stable and \"finished\". Any new updates from this point will feel more like extra content, than the game making up for obviously missing parts. This is a good thing :) It's just too bad about the lack of online. With out it It's not as easy of a recommendation as it deserves to be, but hopefully in the (near) future, that will be rectified.\n\nPros:\n- Uniquely designed competition / mechanics\n- Great presentation\n- Easy to understand, but challenging\n\nCons:\n- No online... :(", "timestamp_created": 1407419931, "timestamp_updated": 1407494013, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.622781", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "11588184": {"recommendationid": "11588184", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053641770", "num_games_owned": 327, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1065, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 67, "last_played": 1514166376}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is absolutely brilliant.

The other players are getting the advantage... but not really, you have weapons, swords and bows and javelins/spears to fight them off, some quicker some slower but more damage, there are many, many many many weapons to this game to kill your undead enemies, atleast, i think there are. \n\n(plus theres assassins blades... so thats cool :D)\n\nEach time you finish a game, more content gets added (it of course tells you what once you beat it) like more weapons, traps, gods and more, so if theres not enough content for you, dont you worry there will be more.\n\nSo your a monster and you kill the player, whoever got the last blow turns into the human, and you got it, what do you do? go to the blacksmith shop, or find it, because every time you hit the player, you earn \"blood\" which you can give to a statue in the blacksmith shop. the statue is happy from the blood you spilled, and rewards you, with money, that you can use for weapons or purchase a \"spell\" that replaces your dodge roll.\n\nSo this game offers much, and is definatley worth ten bucks, infact i think that is a lower price than what this game offers, and the fact this game is going to ofer more in the future... well thats just great.\n\nSo welcome to the dungeons, Crawler", "timestamp_created": 1407410271, "timestamp_updated": 1407410271, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503720", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "11586204": {"recommendationid": "11586204", "author": {"steamid": "76561197986561018", "num_games_owned": 124, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2774, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512162279}, "language": "english", "review": "I don't think I have ever \"tried\" a game and gotten so quickly hooked!

Developed by the two man team over at Powerhoof, Crawl is a local co-op dungeon crawler for up to four players, and provides the answer to that very question.\n\nIn a rather interesting turn of events, one of you controls the hero, slaying monsters, gaining levels, and buying loot, while the other 3 players use ghosts to possess traps or summon monsters with the simple goal of killing you to become the hero instead. The point of Crawl is to survive long enough to reach level 10, then activating a portal to the final boss encounter. The player that reaches and defeats the final boss first wins the game.\n\nIf you have local friends who frequent your house, Crawl is an insanely good time. Its short 30-minute games, combined with its accessible pick-up-and-play control scheme, make it ideal for parties or for larger groups of people to pass the controllers around. However, if you\u2019re running solo, you\u2019ll most likely grow tired of fighting the A.I. rather quickly and there isn\u2019t anything to do after that.\n\nFull review: http://wp.me/p2go2D-4Gd", "timestamp_created": 1407372486, "timestamp_updated": 1407372486, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.999740", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "11580459": {"recommendationid": "11580459", "author": {"steamid": "76561198126933201", "num_games_owned": 188, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 517, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1434154201}, "language": "english", "review": "I just did a playthrough of this game by myself and I must say it quite surprised me.

Ever.\n\nBut this game deserves it. So let's get started.\n\n[h1] First of all, what is Crawl? [/h1]\n\nLike the name suggests, along with the pictures, you might understand that it's your usual dungeon crawler. But it isn't.\nIt IS a dungeon crawler. But not in the likes of Diablo or Torchlight. It's more of a skilled-hack 'n' slash-dungeon crawler.\nAnd TBH, as a fan of dungeon crawlers, this is the best one I've ever seen. \n\nI might also add that I may have a little bias about it because of the god damned amazing music/teaser trailer. But I digress.\n\nAs I've said before, it's not your usual dungeon crawler. And there's also another reason because of that. It's not open world and it's not story driven. It's an arcade game.\n\nAnd it does it really well. The game, as you may already know if you're reading this review because you want to be sure that the game is nice, is a local co-op/versus game.\n\n\"But Baron! I don't have any friends! I'm a god damned loner!\"\n\nWell they added some bots which you can play against for \"practice while you're waiting for your friends\". And they're also going to add multiplayer in the near future. So that's good. Because I'm also a loner.\n\n[h1] How's the gameplay? [/h1]\n\nIt's good, 10/potato.\n\nJust kidding. The gameplay is absolutely amazing, but to be played at its best you NEED a controller. Which isn't a problem FOR ME, but might me a problem for the people who can't afford to buy one. Any controller that is supported by steam will do. But personally I prefer to use a PS3 controller with the scarlet crush drivers.\n\nAs I've said at the start of this review, the game is part hack 'n' slash. And it's a blast. The controls are responsive and easy to learn. It's literally just two buttons. I've never found myself saying \"God damn it, I didn't want to do that!\", if I died it was 90% of the times because of the skill of the bots or because I wasn't good enough.\n\nThe only problem about it might be that they made the button to attack also the button to \"use\" stuff. I've found myself sometimes entering the final boss battle by mistake with little health remaining and dying by the hands of the bots controlling the boss.\n\n[h1] How are the graphics? [/h1]\n\nWell, I really don't know, I don't have eyes to see a god damned PICTURE ON THE STORE PAGE.\n\n[h1] TL;DR? [/h1]\n\nDo you like co-op fast paced hack 'n' slash dungeon crawlers games? Then this is for you, I guess, I've never heard of games like this, but whatever, everyone has their own fetish.\n\n[h1] Gib scor plz [/h1]\n\nKK bb, from a scale from 1 to 10:\n\nMusic: 10\n\nGameplay: 10 [seeing yourself getting raped to death just to kill the same bot that killed you is an amazing feeling]\n\nGraphics: 10\n\nOverall: 10\n\nOn a side note, it runs on my toaster, 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1407349696, "timestamp_updated": 1407548597, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.654423", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "11577699": {"recommendationid": "11577699", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028086019", "num_games_owned": 964, "num_reviews": 68, "playtime_forever": 916, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1461428833}, "language": "english", "review": "You can be a boss (at least 1/3 of it) and beat crap out of your friend.\nWhat are you waiting for?

All sound direction is incredibly fitting, with voice samples sounding as if straight out of an authentic 80's pinball machine or arcade cabinet. Suspenseful horror aesthetics and the doom-impending tone of the music compliment the tension, chaos and madness of the multiplayer struggle for supremacy all too well.\n\nYou begin by choosing one of the Gods of unspeakable horrors, determining which set of ghastly familiars you will be taking control of and leveling up throughout your mad grab for humanity. Blood is gained as you spill it from your human target to be exchanged for gold and used at merchants to buy an array of varied equipment and skills, ranging anywhere from double-daggers with fast speed but short reach to floating glyphs that fire lasers on your command. This puts a lot of motivation on the monster players to bleed the human as much as possible, in order to better prepare themselves with loot once stealing back humanity. \n\nMonsters themselves add one of the deepest layers of the game, each with branching sets of evolution trees to play around with. Evolving your monsters is dependent on Vitae which is acquired through enemy humans leveling up, and keeps the playing field between the two more or less balanced. Honestly, though, I don't think anyone is capable of explaining the mechanics as well as [url=http://youtu.be/2_3xrqjTyes]the trailer[/url] does.\n \nBefore even getting a chance to sink my teeth into [i]Crawls'[/i] gritty and visceral gameplay I couldn't stop watching the trailer, it sent chills down the spine. It's really the most captivating I'd seen in awhile and the narration nails the urgency of your doom-ridden quest. I had to know how such an effective voice actor was acquired. \n\nAfter questioning the developers on the subject, it turns out that the narration wasn't hired or professional help at all, but the contributions of a close friend they had previously worked with and this fact just fortified in my mind the strong bonds behind the creation of the game and it's origin of a personal and human nature. According to Dave, [i]\"The voice actor from the trailer is a friend of ours, Adrian Vaughan. He\u2019s a 3d artist who we met at the first game studio that Barney and I worked at together. He\u2019s one of those guy\u2019s who\u2019s always putting on funny accents and I got him to do some voices for an adventure game I made for a competition (called [u]The Unicated[/u]).\"[/i] \n\nApparently they weren't expecting the trailer to gain as much attention and praise as it did for the game, as Dave goes on, [i]\"We were incredibly pleased with how the trailer went, we had no idea if it would be received well or not while we were working on it. We thought it might be too long, or wordy, and it was difficult getting a balance of the tone and the explanation of the game. We\u2019re so glad we did it that way now though.\"[/i]\n\n[i]Crawl[/i] clearly has some heavy retro arcade influences, and upon discussing the game with the developers the sources of inspiration were confirmed. [i]\"For Barney, two big inspirations were [i]Bomberman[/i] and [i]Gauntlet[/i], and they shine through in the gameplay most of all.\"[/i] and with it's blend of the dungeon delving hack'n'slash action of [i]Gauntlet[/i] and the rage-inducing competitive aspect of [i]Bomberman[/i], I'm inclined to agree that both of these examples shine through. He continues to explain, [i]\"We\u2019ve grabbed inspiration from tonnes of games though really, old RPGs like [i]Legend of Zelda[/i], the gothic tone of the first [i]Diablo[/i], and a bit of [i]Dark Souls\u2019[/i] brutality to name a few.\"[/i] All being perfect representations of where [i]Crawl[/i] takes its grim and savage direction.\n\nThis is a game that will bring together the most unsuspecting of players, serious-minded people who don't even game will forget themselves and get caught up in the blood-boiling clash for mortality. Not only does it bring friends together but it tests the limits of your friendship, edging you closer to feelings of vengeance on your once trusted peer. Similar to the feeling of having the excitement of 1st place in [i]Mario Kart[/i] swiftly crushed and ripped from you by a friend lucky enough to get that one Blue Shell and take your place of glory, leaving you with nothing but the desire to track them down and kick their ass.\n\n[i]Crawl[/i] is a game made by friends, for friends. A multiplayer experience unlike anything seen since the 90's. A game made by two close compatriots who wanted to rediscover and reinvent what gathered them around the tube so many years ago. The kind of entertainment we've lost sight of after so many years of growing into adults, getting jobs and families, and in general forgetting what made us really have fun as kids.\n\nDespite being its best around warm-bodied experiences I can still wholeheartedly recommend the game even for those who might be too busy or too far from friends to partake in the multi-person mayhem. With bots and their adjustable difficulty, I was still kept on the edge of my seat during every attempt to steal the victory from the intelligent computer opponents. With even more balancing on the horizon as well as constant updates to content, and a serious community involvement from the developers on forums there is pure determination shown in shaping the game how players want and proves that [i]Crawl[/i] is already one of the shining examples of Early Access done [b]right[/b].", "timestamp_created": 1407312138, "timestamp_updated": 1407328526, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 258, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.824221", "comment_count": "13", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "11538984": {"recommendationid": "11538984", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022381748", "num_games_owned": 482, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 95, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1424908233}, "language": "english", "review": "A fun, competitive dungeon-crawler that you can play with friends.

This has lead to the downfall of \u201ccouch co-op,\u201d with many multiplayer games being released completely lacking any local multiplayer feature. It's time we say enough is enough! I still have buds over to play video games, real ones that stay too late and often drink too much (Hey Will! Sure, what kind of party would it be if you didn't vomit everywhere?).\n\nThe devs of \u201cCrawl\u201d remember the yesteryear of \u201ccouch co-op\u201d and they hear our cries. Like silent, brooding Batman-y types they're the heroes local multiplayer deserves; and they're paying an homage to classic, \u201cGauntlet\u201d type dungeon crawlers. The concept is simple: you and up to three friends select a god to represent (you can also use bots that are HIGHLY competent). Each god represents different creatures you'll take the form of during battle so choose wisely. Then you're dropped into the first level of the dungeon. One player is the hero, the rest of you are douchebag specters of death who's sole purpose is to thwart the crawler with traps and dark symbols through which you become corporeal monsters. First player to kill the crawler becomes one themselves, and the cycle continues. Be warned: \u201cCrawl\u201d has friendship killing potential the likes of which haven't been seen since \u201cMario Party,\u201d \u201cMario Kart,\u201d and the little-known \u201cMario Fucks Your Friend's Mother.\u201d\n\nThroughout each dungeon you'll gather gold to spend on upgrades and weapons. As you clear each section you'll use vitae gathered to \u201cevolve\u201d your monsters, branching off into more powerful ranged, magic, and warrior types. Each level also features an ominous Stonehenge-like monument pulsating with blue magicka that unlocks the final boss once you or one of your former pals reach level 10. At that point you can choose to face the big baddie. You'll get a cool battle strategy hint in the boss fountain room before entering the arena. Each of your friends (and bots) will possess the boss, working in tandem to stop you from winning by using a variety of attacks. Assuming you win it's game over, you won! Assuming you lose another friend gets a shot. But each time you face the boss you do damage to the monument and if no one wins you will all game over.\n\n\u201cCrawl\u201d is beautiful, stylish, and a blast to play. The monsters are really cool, the music is most excellently retro, and when playing against three friends (or AI bots with the difficulty increased) it is a challenge. The devs (now famously) sent out a cool apology gif when they had to delay \u201cCrawl\u201d briefly \u2013 which to me is a good indicator that they will work with the community to continue expanding and polishing an already excellent core game. \n\nALAS, I have one major gripe. It isn't a deal breaker, not for me anyway. But at the moment there is no ONLINE multiplayer. Now I know what I said earlier. I miss the bygone days of local mutliplayer and I'm happy to see it as an option. But I still have lots of friends I want to play this with online, ones that live far away in mythical places like California and Canada. I want to live in a world where I don't have to choose. I want both, perhaps greedily. Hopefully we'll see it implemented. Otherwise keep in mind this is Early Access. At the moment there appears to be one final boss and only three deities to choose from. But what is there is highly polished and very fun. They'll be adding more end bosses and deities throughout development. I also hope to see more variety in the dungeon layouts and color schemes. But as it is this is an excellent title. For ten bucks I easily, heartily recommend this.\n\nReviewer's Note: \u201cMario Fucks Your Friend's Mother\u201d probably doesn't exist.

Sollte es einem Spieler gelingen die HP des Menschen auf 0 zu reduzieren, so tauschen sie Rollen. Das ganze geht so lange, bis ein Spieler als Mensch Level 10 erreicht, und den Endboss besiegt ODER wenn der Boss insgesamt 3 mal von den Spielern herausgefordert, aber nicht bezwungen wurde. In dem Fall gewinnt der Spieler mit dem h\u00f6chsten Level.\n\nIm Laufe des Spiels kann man seine Monster mit Punkten aufwerten, die man durch Level-Ups der Gegner bekommt. Durch Schaden, den man am Menschen anrichtet bekommt man Bluttropfen, die man gegen Geld und somit gegen bessere Waffen oder andere Statboni eintauschen kann.\n\nDank des wechselseitigen Spiels kann man nie sagen, wer nun gewinnen wird und es bleibt permanent spannend. Vielleicht sieht es schlecht aus, weil ein Spieler schon level 9 erreicht und man selber auf Level 2 rumgurkt, jedocht kann man dann -wie oben erw\u00e4hnt- seine Monster verst\u00e4rken und kann wieder den anderen Spielern das Leben schwer machen.\nNach einer kompletten Runde (die schnell mal 30-45 Minuten dauern kann) schaltet man weitere Monster und weitere Items frei.

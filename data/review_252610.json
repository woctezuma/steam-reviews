You also have to manage gasoline, food, medicine and ammo. Honestly the game feels roughly difficult to The Binding of Isaac, but I haven\u2019t played too long at the time of this review. There\u2019s a bulk of unlockables to achieve through a single play through by grabbing ZOMBPOINTS (or some shit like that) and upgrading existing traits and perks.

Taking pages from games such as Oregon Trail, FTL, and many more, Death Road is a fantastic blend of gameplay, humor, and substance rolled into one giant fun burrito. Crafting your motley crew of idiots, you hop in a car and speed off in the direction of the Great White North, the last bastion of humanity against the zombie menace. Along the way you'll learn new things, meet annoying people, splatter a lot of zombies, amass more weapons than a rogue state, and ultimately die horribly three days from the Canadian Border because your cat went ballistic on you. Behind the goofy exterior lies a challenging, but entertaining game--those having a hard time with the basic gamemode can try Rare Characters mode, a magical place where special characters might join you on the road to Canada. Not enough time for the long haul? Short Trip to Heck gives you a fraction of the time you have in the base game, promising more risk, but maybe better rewards! The game itself looks and sounds decent enough--you'll quickly get bored of the soundtrack and replace it with something better, but the characters and the dialogue will leave you giggling for at least a little while. Death Road, as the name suggests, is not a forgiving mistress--RNG can make or break your run in a matter of seconds, and one broken down car or angry pal can spell doom.The biggest offender, in my opinion, is the gaping hole of usefulness between melee and ranged weaponry. Even if you build your character(s) to be car-chucking ubermen, your trip will come to an abrupt end more often than if you focused more on firearms. Add the nebulous skill/trait system into the mix (Max Rank in Mechanics? Too bad--have fun repairing anything until halfway through the run) and you have a game that is fun when it works, but frustrating when it throws you a curveball.

Even for casual gamers, Death Road starts off so simple that even your grandma could play it. That is, until she reaches the halfway point to Canada in which things start to become a little more stressful as zombies become more aggressive and materials such as food, gas, and ammo began to disappear faster than you can gather it. Not to mention all of those random events which can be tremendously overpowering (at the time),  or absolutely devastating. You can never truly be prepared or have too much stuff in this game thanks to these events. Also, the character customization is fun but could use some more tools. I do love that there is the \"play with familiar characters\" option, as surviving the zombie apocalypse along side my AI controlled friends is a good time. The only gripes I have with this game are; 1. Giving the AI controlled characters a gun is a horrible idea as they tend to not know how to conserve ammo at all, and 2. There isn't online multiplayer, which I think would be a terrific addition to the game, even if it\u2019s only with one other player.

And if that hasn\u2019t sold you on Death Road to Canada, then damn, I don\u2019t know what will. Won the game as a paranoid ex-surgeon with a crappy attitude who robbed and double-crossed everyone he met \u2013 what about that is not the best thing you\u2019ve ever heard? But okay, if you\u2019re still wondering what exactly the game has to offer, that\u2019s what this review will get into. Because I am obsessed with this game.\n\nDeath Road to Canada is a zombie survival game that messes with just about every trope in others of the genre. It's more of an arcade-style game \u2013 somewhere between an RPG and a rogue-like -- where you collect loot and team mates to accompany you on a progressively hard journey to the not-destroyed haven of Canada. With simple gameplay of guns and melee weapons, it doesn\u2019t sound too unique. But what sets this game apart is the content and tone.\n\n[b]SELLING POINTS[/b]\nTo start with, it has ridiculous replayability. Different modes to try out with varying difficulties, a long-ass list of rare characters to run into, and dozens of perks and traits to assign to your own custom characters. Add to that some rare traders with rare weapons, rare events that give you better (or worse) loot, vehicles, etc. I\u2019ve played quite a bit, and I still have so much to get through. And even if you know what you [i]can[/i] run into, there\u2019s still the excitement of wondering what you [i]will[/i] encounter each game. Hoo-boy.\n\nWhat surprised me most of all, though, is that Death Road to Canada offers you so many choices. Not just for combat, but as text events. These events often come up with dialogue-style options that determine what your group gets/loses from them. Depending on which characters you have, and their stats, you can respond differently. The choices are what really separates this from similar games, as there are a countless number of them, and they end up giving your characters personality and charm every round (and sick loot, of course).\n\nIf I had to compare it to another game, I would say The Binding of Isaac. Both loot-based games with procedurally-generated scenarios, simple gameplay that gets harder as you continue, and tongue-in-cheek humour. The main difference is that The Binding of Isaac is almost impossible to play in the later stages without either an otherworldly memory or help from the wiki for item synergies, whereas Death Road to Canada encourages you to play the game time and time again, testing things out for yourself being part of the journey. There are so many things to find, while at the same time, there isn\u2019t too much for it to feel overwhelming.\n\nAs with other loot-based games, there\u2019s a pretty heavy element of RNG in this one. That would usually be an issue, but I think Death Road to Canada balances it well with skill and risk-and-reward mechanics, so it rarely seems unfair. Couple that with some pleasant visuals and sweet chiptunes, and you\u2019ve got yourself a good game that I\u2019ll be playing for ages.\n\n[b]OVERALL RATING[/b]\nThe most fun I\u2019ve had in a while, with some of the best humour and gameplay to lose yourself in for a few hours, and enough to keep you coming back. Might seem a bit gruelling at first, but give it a shot!

You'll play hours and hours and the game will still feel fresh.\n- As mentioned before, the game IS hard and you'll constantly fail, but it's charming in a way you'll only get more interested in your next save every time you lose.\n- Haven't run into a single bug yet. Bugs begone.\n- Every single minimal detail of the game seems to have received special attention. The Dev team has polished EVERY. SINGLE. SPOT of this game.\n- The graphics, zombies, characters and general, are very charming.\n- Has many different mechanics and still being updated with new ones, 1 year after the release.\n- During your gameplay, you'll make WAY more choices and feel way more in control of the game than you would in Organ Trail (drawing a comparison)\nCons:\n- I don't really fucking know any.

America has been completely overrun, and the player has to drive and fight their way north, to the safety of Canada.\n\nYou need to search buildings for food, fuel for your car, medical supplies, weapons (melee and guns) and ammo. You\u2019ll also encounter scenarios, for example bandit attacks, or hazards blocking the road, and your choices can result in positive or negative consequences. Each character in your group has a range of stats including strength, shooting, medical, mechanical and morale, which can be either increased or decreased. You could also gain or lose supplies, or take damage.\n\nYou\u2019ll start with either one or two characters, and along the way you\u2019ll meet new people who you can recruit, up to a maximum party size of four. You directly control one character, but you can switch at any time. Party members can die permanently, but as long as you\u2019ve still got one person alive, the journey can continue.\n\nThe best part of the game is the special characters who can be recruited. My favourite so far is Valkyrie, who is pretty much a female version of Marvel\u2019s Thor, equipped with Mjolnir and capable of smashing through zombies in melee and at range. I\u2019ve also met a professional boxer who has killer punches, a medieval knight, and a sumo wrestler.\n\nYou can create custom characters, but this isn't as fun as it sounds, because you're almost forced to play characters with good fitness and strength skills. Anyone else will get tired quickly when attacking repeatedly, which means melee attacks get slower and do less damage, resulting in a much lower chance of surviving \u201csieges\u201d, which is when your group is attacked by a massive horde of zombies. Most of the time, there\u2019s no way to avoid a siege, you just have to survive it.\n\nThe core gameplay loop is enjoyable, but my main problem with DR2C is that its really short. A successful run only takes around 90 minutes, and I survived all the way to Canada on my second attempt. After that all you can really do is roll a new character and go again. Sure, you'll encounter some different scenarios and meet new characters, but you'll also quickly start to see repeats. There are some different gamemodes (shorter journey, extended journey, special characters only, hard mode) but they don\u2019t really vary the gameplay at all.

The action is very brawler-like, but your characters are extremely limited by their stamina - after a few swings, more if you have more stamina, you start getting red and sweaty, you swing slower and hit for less damage. If a zombie grabs you, you move more slowly, act more slowly, and need to get out of its grasp quickly or you'll start taking damage.

This might turn a lot of people off, for good reason - but in a way, that's the game's charm. More than a survival game, it's a road trip game, and when you pack a bunch of people into a shitty old car and drive across the country, there's no way you can account for everything that will happen along the way.  There's less chance of your friends being eaten during a road trip, of course, but you know what I mean.

Honestly was supprised how much I enjoyed this game, going into it with little to no prior knowledge. \nJust for reference: I have played (and beaten) every game mode, and experienced most of the random events\n\nPROS:\n-Outstanding re-playability\n-RNG is pretty fair and balanced (compared to other games of this type)\n-Humorous approach to an often serious topic\n-Familiar characters make it a bit more personal\n-soundtrack\n-Local 2-player works well enough\n\nCONS:\n-AI is usually reliable, but sometimes it makes silly mistakes (or drops your rare weapons for golf clubs)\n-RNG can screw you over at times\n-Some events seem to appear very often, which makes some runs a bit more bland\n-Marathon mode (help me)\n-No steam cloud (could be added later?)\n-No online multiplayer (could be added later?)\n\n\nALL AROUND: 8/10\nHighly recommended, especially if you have some friends to play with. (I put 40+ hours into this game in my first week, it's a bit addictive).

I often find myself laughing at the random scenarios I encounter on my way to Canada. DR2C offers a lot of replayability due to its wide selection of game modes and varied characters.\n\nI only have a few cons about the game. It would have benefitted from a more convenient way of quitting in the middle of a run without clearing the save file. The only way I've figured out to do this is pressing Alt+F4 (it's not a joke, it actually works). Another thing is I wish DR2C had online co-op.

It's difficult enough to require focus and timing, and difficult enough that your choices have weight to them, without the game being unfairly hard. The randomization elements also keep there from being one \"correct\" way to play the game; while one playthrough is relatively short (just as was Oregon Trail), subsequent runs are constantly throwing you into new situations, and there's a variety of different modes to replay the game in as well as unlockables, a character creator, and local multiplayer to keep things fresh.\n\nThe music is enjoyable, though there's not many tracks and the game would benefit from having more variety in that regard (especially since other aspects of the game tend to be better at avoiding repetition). The zombies are often [i]visually different[/i], which is a nice touch, but where Left 4 Dead adds Special Infected with unique abilities into its assortment of undead, Death Road to Canada doesn't capitalize on the opportunity to do something similar.

Road to Canada is a charming game about surviving a trip to Canada through swarms of the undead. If you don't like apocalyptic games, try DR2C. I never cared for them, but this game definitely switched my views. I personally haven't gotten to Canada yet, but I always come back to it since the possibilities in-game are endless. No two games are exactly alike, making each time you replay it a brand new adventure. It can be challenging using a keyboard though, so I definitely recommend a controller to make the gameplay more fun and smooth. \n\nAnother charming thing about this game is that you can customize your own characters. Create yourself, your sibling, your mom, your dad, your great grandmother, your favorite Youtuber, legitimately anyone. There are multiple different traits and perks to give them, which give you advantages and disadvantages when you begin the game/someone joins your team. You can level up perks, and even unlock new ones as you earn points by playing the game. \n\nThe one thing that can be iffy at times is leveling up a character's basic skills in game. To know how good/bad they are, you have to go through an event to reveal said skill, or it will be randomly revealed. If you do not know how the character is at the skill, it'll be a mystery when you level them up. This doesn't hinder the gameplay, but it may get on some people's nerves just a bit. \n\nIn conclusion, Death Road to Canada is a charming, fun game that will have you coming back for more.

Quelques point n\u00e9gatif tout de m\u00eame sont : Entres les missions de r\u00e9coltes, le peu d'interactions entre les personnages fait souffrir un peu le gameplay du jeu, Il est tr\u00e8s facile de tomber sur les m\u00eames \u00e9venements ou dialogue dans la m\u00eame partie. L'autre point n\u00e9gatif serait au niveau de la collecte de resources, l\u00e0, le jeu ne vous fait pas de cadeau et est tr\u00e8s in\u00e9quilibr\u00e9 au niveau des ressources possibles d'obtenir dans une mission de r\u00e9colte.

Jeder Spieldurchlauf f\u00fchlt sich anders an und man hat eigentlich immer etwas zu lachen.\n\nW\u00e4hrend man nach Kanada reist, muss man Zwischenstopps einlegen um Nahrung, Benzin, Munition usw. zu sammeln. Dabei wird das Game zu einer Art Top-Down Hack&Slay im Stil von Hero Siege. Die Zombiehorden sind reichlich platziert und oft muss man abw\u00e4gen, ob es nicht besser ist die Beine in die Hand zu nehmen oder man doch noch dieses eine Haus versucht zu looten. Unterwegs trifft man auf kuriose Charaktere, H\u00e4ndler, Banditen und verr\u00fcckte Tiere :D\nMan kann f\u00fcr seine Survival-Gruppe bis zu 3 zus\u00e4tzliche Personen rekrutieren.\n\nLeider hab ich es bisher nicht bis nach Kanada geschafft denn das ist eine gr\u00f6\u00dfere Herausforderung als vorher gedacht :D Dennoch habe ich mit dem Spiel schon mega viel Spa\u00df gehabt und ich bin mir sicher eines Tages das Ziel zu erreichen.\n\nWer sich vom minimalistischen Stil des Spiels nicht abschrecken l\u00e4sst sollte sich Death Road to Canada zumindest mal ansehen.

Along the way she met Jason from friday the 13th, Link from legend of zelda, and an Elvis impersonator (again I stress that this was not a rare characters run). Jason possessed an unbreakable machete. Link wielded a magical sword that could shoot magic missiles. Finally, Elvis wielded an angels voice that could win the heart of a tyrant and also constantly attracted zombies to our party during raids.\n\nRandom girl, Jason, Link, and Elvis had many adventures from the time they almost died in a shopping mall to because the security guards kept blocking the door to that time Jason summoned spirits on a ouija board. Alas, nothing gold can stay. In the last 3 days of the journey, a series of travesties befell the party. Elvis fell like many elvis's before him, to blockages caused by human excrement. Seriously though, he died in a sewer right at the border of canada. Rando girl, Link, and Jason wiped their tears and soldiered onwards knowing that a such a voice was to be forever lost to Canada and the world.\n\nThe party came to a Cabin in the woods to reflect and regain their energy but found they had been followed from the sewers by a herd of zombies. On this scenic cabin by the lake, the trio fought for their lives. Here, Jason too fell like many before him: slashing up bodies while trespassing on a campground. Except this Jason's slashing was for the love of his friends, not the hate of his enemies. Link dumped his body in the lake because he knew Jason would want that. Rando Girl picked up Jason's indestructible and swore she would live to tell Canada of Jason's redemption.\n\nFinally, almost at the border of Canada, Link and Rando girl were trapped while passing through a city. Rando girl's skill with Jason's infamous machete complemented Link's finesse with the sword of evil's bane. Despite the fact that their party was smaller than ever, they found the strength to fight like an army. The copious amount of submachine gun ammo helped as well. However, predictable as it may be, Link was not destined to leave this city alive. As he lay dying on the ground in Rando girls arms, he gave her his sword and said something to the extent of \"You will be endangered if you travel by yourself, have this\".\n\nRando girl ran as fast as she could and found herself at the gates of Canada itself. Months of travelling had put her within a stone throw away from canada but tens of thousands of zombies at the iron walls of Canada blocked her way. Machete in one hand, master sword in the other, she set at them. Her comrades didn't die for nothing. Even though the ammo was all gone, her chainsaw still had gas and she was all out of bubble gum. The border guards didn't see her walking to the gates until she was in spitting range, only a cloud of blood that seemed to drift through the horde towards them. Of course, such a warrior was welcomed into Canada.\n\nI would like to think that Rando girl never met these three characters.

We came across bandits, and I made my character distract them while Woof got away. Apparently my character was untrustworthy and joined the bandits, turning on Woof and injuring him in the process. Soon after Woof (now the only person left in the part) had his morale at rock bottom, and said that someone in the party wasn't pulling their own weight. The only option was Woof, so, sadly, I had to make Woof kick himself out. Woof left in anger, and the dream of making it to Canada was dead.\n\n12/10 Would recommend to anyone who likes zombie survival games or games similar to the Oregon Trail. Would have myself betray a dog again.", "timestamp_created": 1510832394, "timestamp_updated": 1510832490, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36545251": {"recommendationid": "36545251", "author": {"steamid": "76561198286422232", "num_games_owned": 48, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 2149, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512510835}, "language": "english", "review": "I bought Death Road To Canada due to one of my friends telling me how much he loved it. This was recently after I bought Organ Trail, so the zombie road trip \u201cgenre\u201d or whatever had actually become a significant part of my gaming life for some time. As such, I will make multiple comparisons between the two games during this review, though I think I can make a decent case for this game even if you haven\u2019t played Organ Trail.\n\nNow, I\u2019m not about to crap on Organ Trail here; it\u2019s a fun game and appeals well to nostalgia. However, in terms of sheer fun I\u2019ve had from both games, DR2C FAR  exceeds Organ Trail. I believe this is because DR2C naturally has a lot more player input when compared to Organ Trail. During your time on the Death Road, you\u2019ll make many choices that can have serious ramifications for your characters. If you make the wrong decision, it could cost you valuable supplies, your car, or even a party member\u2019s life. Believe me,  in that final stretch of the game, you\u2019ll need as many people as possible.\n\nCharacters are handled  much better in this game as well.  Unlike in Organ Trail, where your characters are mere sprites that are essentially interchangeable, your party members in DR2C will stand out from one another, not just in appearance, but in ability. Every character has a perk, an advantage to help them survive the Death Road, and a trait, which gives them a personality quirk. This applies to both your random and custom characters. Considering how you can only start with 2 characters, but can have a party of four, the people you  pick up along the way can complement each other\u2019s skills or lead to bitter infighting.  As weird as I may sound, I frequently get emotionally attachedto my ragtag crews, and the adventure often feels like it has actual weight to it.\n\nNot that Death Road to Canada is all doom and gloom. The game handles the apocalypse with a cheeky sense of humor and no small amount of pop culture absurdity. Find a naked horse man running about? You can recruit him! A dog joins the party? Teach it how to shoot a shotgun!  Run into a man selling anime and anime accessories? Buy a figurine from him to raise morale! The dead walking the Earth is far from being the strangest thing happening here.\n\nLastly, the game is significantly more difficult to survive to the end in normal mode than Organ Trail was on its hardest difficulty, and I think it\u2019s better because of it. The zombies in DR2C don\u2019t infect you when they bite, but 3 bites without healing is enough to kill most characters, and you can kiss one goodbye if he/she gets swallowed up by a horde. Combine this with a  15 day journey ending in a massive final challenge means that you\u2019ll probably TPK more often than have anyone make it to Canada. Yet I\u2019d argue the journey beats the destination in this case.  Even when you fail, the game\u2019s dynamic keeps you entertained, and you\u2019ll always have an absurd, entertaining story to watch anyway.\n\nIn conclusion, Death Road to Canada is definitely worth the price  from my perspective. It styles itself in a way that gives it a ton of replay value, sprinkles in addicting gameplay, and mixes it all together with a lovable and strange cast of characters (both your own and the rares). I would definitely recommend.\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1510810624, "timestamp_updated": 1510810624, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.712494", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36545243": {"recommendationid": "36545243", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990411077", "num_games_owned": 108, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3555, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 32, "last_played": 1513674643}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is so so so good!\n\nDevs, please never stop updating it with new content consistently like you have been!

It can feel brutally unfair at times; characters can get tired quickly and be unable to fight back, which in siege events can mean certain, cheap feeling death. However, overall the game is very compelling and charming. Each attempt feels like the start of a new story, helped by random events and characters appearing. You learn to cut and run when appropriate, which weapons suit you best, and when it's worth taking a risk. You really get into the spirit of it all, and feel like you're just scraping by most of the time. \n\nThe game has a good sense of humour, and had me laughing fairly often. It's light hearted, not grimdark, which helps the whole permadeath thing not sting as much as it could have. If you go into Death Road to Canada anticipating fun little vignette stories that will probably end badly, it's a blast. If you set out to win, you're going to be disappointed. I couldn't say how heavily the randomisation factors is, I haven't played it enough to accurately say, but it *feels* like you're destined to crash and burn at least a dozen times before you make it.\n\ntl;dr fun little roguelite, randomisation can mean life or death, very charming and endearing, great to play over lunch or just for an hour when you need a break from other stuff.

This was easily one of the best games I've purchased on steam.\n\nThe premise is pretty simple, You start with 1-2 characters and your ultimate goal is to survive for fifteen days until you can make it to Canada. All characters have random stats, A personality trait, And a skill that can benefit one of or more of their stats. The catch for the most part is that you have no idea as to what these stats actually are. Traits can also cause positive effects, However they can also enduce consequences. A large part of the game is simply trying to figure out what it is each person is good at, And developing a balanced skillset between your party members.\n\nHowever it's not always that easy. While trying to learn as much about your chracters as you can, You also need to stock resources for your team. Ultimately when you fail to do this, Party members can end up dead or abandon your party all together. You are able to recruit newer members to replace fallen ones, However it starts the education process all over again. Sometimes you may even encounter special characters who can do unique things.\n\nThis is a great game all around, If nothing else you should easily be able to get 20~ hours out of it.

A martial artist who sings after he attacks and he wore a wolf mask.\n\nThe final siege started and I was ready to rock. I played through DRTC multiple times and I never got this far and I knew my party was more than capable. I entered a building and found 2 grenades. I picked them up and either I pressed the wrong button or someone in my party used it. To my horror, a grenade was thrown in our faces and it all happened in a flash. Danial was blown out the building and he had that skull mark above him while 2 of my other members died inside. My heart sank.\n\nAlvis, had low HP from the blast and survived but at this point I didn't care because there was no way I would survive the last siege with one guy at low HP and no guns.\n\nMiraculously, I managed to weave between zombies using martial arts on any lone ones in the way. I swear if Alvis had stood for a second longer near the Zombies at the border he would have died but alas, he didn't. I made it to Canada!\n\nThe fall and rise of emotions that whole scene gave me was a blast.\n\nPROS: \n\n.No game plays out the same, so many different things can happen with the RNG\n\n.Funny and light-hearted, not an edgy Zombie game does not take itself seriously.\n\n.The music is good and wacky, it fits the tone of the game surprisingly well\n\n.Just when you think you saw all the game has to offer, you have not.\n\n.That feeling when you get good rng: AKA, finding a room with loads of food/ammo\n\n.Every door you have not yet opened is marked with a small flash - Very Helpful!\n\n.Risk for Reward gameplay - its getting dark, the music has turned ominous, the zombies are now faster. Do I enter this last building for more supplies or run back to the car?\n\n.I have never felt too O.P. A lot of Zombie games make you a one man army near the end, but\nDRTC can turn the tables on your supplies with random events\n\nCONS:\n\n.Gets addictive, losing in the game can be frustrating and makes you go\"Just one more time\" \n\n.When the game gives you bad rng. (Group members arguing over a fart, etc) Be warned, this \ngame is a Troll but its the rng that makes it so interesting. \n\n.Its hard to make out your characters in hordes of zombies.\n\n.Sometimes you will be doomed by the hordes and you just have to accept it.\n\nOverall, I totally recommend DRTC. It surprised me by how good it was because I normally don't like Zombie games yet this is the best zombie game I have ever played.\n(Resident Evil 4 does not count, they are not Zombies)\n\nTo this day, I still don't know who tossed that Grenade.", "timestamp_created": 1509527277, "timestamp_updated": 1510357468, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36182054": {"recommendationid": "36182054", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000923440", "num_games_owned": 563, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 1188, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507387227}, "language": "english", "review": "Very cute!

Este p**o juego!\n\nEsta genial!  \n\nEl camino de la muerte hacia Canada es un juego de administracion de recursos y decisiones de eventos, reclutaje y entrenamiento para llevar a tu peque\u00f1o grupo de sobrevivientes desde Florida hasta Canada y el final.. esta... GENIAL!\n\nPrimero que nada, el juego esta suficientemente dificil para no ser aburrido o frustrante. Me tarde dos dias para aprender a usar apropiadamente bombas y escopetas para llegar a Canada, creo que perdi como 16 veces antes de que al fin entendi como sobrevivir esos cuatro minutos de infierno Zombi y que no muriera de hambre a cada rato.\n\nAparte de eso, una vez que ya tienes una maestria en sobrevivencia en el modo \"Normal\" ahora tienes 8 modos mas para divertirte! Desde un modo maraton en donde tienes que jugar hasta la muerte hasta un modo donde solo salen puros personajes de chiste pero OP como Gigaman(megaman), Lunk (Link de Zelda), Rack Rhymes (The Walking Dead) y un monton mas que cuando los encuentras solo puedes sonreir con las tontadas que hacen.\n\nUna corrida normal de 15 dias, desde principio a fin, dura mas o menos de 3 a 4 horas, creo, si es que te detienes a cada lugar que encuentras (y deberias), pero hay tantos personajes diferentes y lugares que explorar, que ya llevo una semana y aun encuentro cosas nuevas.\n\nAdemas, el juego cuenta con un sistema de creacion de personaje con mas de 20 beneficios diferentes y otras 30 personalidades con la cual puedes hacer decenas de personajes para que encuentres tu propio estilo de supervivencia.\nTal vez te gusta andar de pistolero o levantador de muebles para aventarzelos a las hordas. SWOLE!\n\nAdicionalmente, este juego es perfecto para jugarlo desde el sofa con un control para PC y hasta se puede jugar de dos jugadores en local en una sola PC.\n\nLos logros son dificiles de sacar, hay logros que son mucho de suerte (que te salga un evento o personaje) y otros de habilidad (acabar el juego sin que te muerdan o que te maten) Yo diria que la dificultad esta en un 8 de 10, ya que hay muy pocos jugadores que tienen estos logros.\n\nEste juego se merece 9 figuritas de Anime de 10 bombas molotov.

Just recently tried this game with my Nintendo Switch Joy Cons with my mom and boy do they feel just right for this game. Switch version through Nindies when? I'd gladly buy this game a second time. Not even kidding. The sooner this gets there the more sales it'll get before the other indies overflood the eShop, trust me.\n\nTo everyone else looking to buy this game: \nHighly recommended, if you're looking for a Halloween game that isn't all spooks and jumpscares but laughs and frustration (the good, entertaining kind) with a friend or family member, then this game is totally for you.\n\nDeath Road to Canada is a rougelike game, meaning it's maps and encounters are all randomized and when you die, you die for good and have to start over. But you unlock things the more you play, so dying isn't bad... Unless you die right away if you have terrible luck.\n\nYou can make your own characters and let them \"inhabit\" the world of Death Road to Canada and have a chance of meeting or even recruiting them as you play the game or choose a mode where you only meet the rare characters; each being super risky but super fun to have in a run.\n\nThe game has a ton of references to other games, lots of jokes and is overall hard not to enjoy or crack a smile at while playing it. It gets even better if you play it with a friend or family member. Some might not enjoy its humor, but I certainly do!\n\nThe music is also pretty good and I really dig its pixel art style.\n\nOne thing I have to mention, though, is that this game is probably not made for super long sessions solo. I think 30 minutes/until you die per day is more than enough, because otherwise you might get tired of this game fast. Personally I only play it when I can convince my 63 y/o mom to play it with me (I'm a 24 y/o loser with no friends and social anxiety, don't judge me too hard) and I get bored of it on my own after 30 minutes. \nThis game is entertaining solo, too, but not as much as when you play co-op, in my opinion. If you expect a similar experience like Binding of Isaac or Enter the Gungeon, then I'll have to disappoint you.\n\nAll in all, though, I'd say this game is great if you need a co-op game for Halloween that's fun. I don't think online co-op is a thing yet, but I hope it will be.", "timestamp_created": 1508709514, "timestamp_updated": 1508709514, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 55, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.815634", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35911766": {"recommendationid": "35911766", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031494401", "num_games_owned": 366, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 173, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504930857}, "language": "english", "review": "Who wouldn't want to go to Canada to escape the zombie-ocalypse?!\n\nDeath Road to Canada is a rogue like beat-um up with a fairly healthy dose of Oregon Trail like survival elements. \n\nAlthough you do have a great deal of control in the game, between what locations you scavenge, what choices you make (like whether to say give up supplies or ram a barricade set up by bandits), whether to sleep and rest or push on through.... \n\nThe outcome will usually leave you guessing, or well... suffering. Even when you think you are making the best deicion, just like life, things don't always go the way you would hope. Your friend may stab you in the back and your forced to leave him behind cause morale is low. Or you may struggle through a horde due to injuries from a previous encounter. \n\nEvery time you play it will feel like a whole new narrative is unfolding. There's even a surprising degree of customization too. You could choose a randomly generated character... or create your own set of familiar faces to use in the game. Give them personalities, and perk traits and see how far you can get with them. \n\nThere's a lot to love with the games charming and odd humor, it's appealing pixelated visual style, and it's all over the place music (well that one is both love and hate.... sometimes the music doesn't really fit the mood, but you take the bad with the good). \n\nIn the end it's a game worth picking up, and sure to give a solid amount of replay value to retro game loving zombie fanatics.

The sheer concept of the game is brilliant, and the built in upgrade system for better future runs as well as laugh-out-loud dialog makes this game a must buy. It's so easy to start up and then pick up the game whenever, as the saving system allows you to complete one event at a time if need be, or complete an entire fun yet challenging run to Canada in one sitting. The game isn't easy, but that's where the bulk of the fun is with the game. Trying to figure out what character combinations go well together to ensure a good run is crucial, but if you want even more of a challenge you can attempt the Death Road solo, or better yet a BERSERK! solo run, which I plan on attempting in the future. Speaking of characters, the built in custom character creator is an outstanding feature of the game. Make your family, friends, favorite YouTubers, or even celebrities, give them their own perks and traits, and then upgrade them through Zombo Town. It makes the game feel especially satisfying when you and your brother make it to Canada, and when your custom character dies to a zombie it makes it even more heart-wrenching. Overall, I can't help but recommend Death Road to Canada for anyone who's considering purchasing the game. It has a ton of replayability, and is really cool to think a four person team made such an incredible title.

There's many different things and places to discover and enjoy.\n\nDeath Road also strongly delivers in its gameplay. It might look easy enough in the trailers to fight through zombies, but when you play the game, it's engaging and offers a unique challenge. You have to manage your resources wisely from the beginning of the run to (hopefully) the end, and you've gotta use your best skills wisely, like your shooting and strength. It might seem like a lot at first, but once you get the basics down, it's really entertaining.\n\nPiece of advice: Don't expect yourself to win the first time you play. In order to have a winning run, you've gotta practice your techniques and how to manage your resources. However, with each run being unique and the gameplay being as engaging as it is, getting better and better is nowhere near boring. Each run builds confidence, and you find yourself strongly looking forward to the day you finally cross that border. Once you win the first time, more modes are unlocked, each of which provides a new challenge for you to face.\n\nOne last thing that I want to briefly mention is the ending to a successful run. I won't spoil what it is, but I'll just say that it's greatly rewarding after all the hours that you put into the game. When I won for the first time, the ending made it greatly satisfying, especially since I never used a wiki along the way.\n\nThis is a remarkable game, and I definitely recommend getting it.

It's an indie RPG where you, well, travel the Death Road up into Canada. What's a death road? Think a highway full of zombies. 'Nuff said.\n       The way I like to think of it, Death Road is a roguelike that offers some satisfying gameplay. it is an RPG that allows you to create your characters. Design their appearance, name them and decide their personality. This is a very fun mechanic, as it allows you to shape the story of your adventure. Combat is fun as well. You are able to freely switch between your party of four, while having three weapons equipped. Your characters have stamina, and guns have ammo. it is simple, but it is resourceful and effective.\n        That's another thing to keep in mind: resources. This actually is extremely important: this can either ruin you or save your butt in clutch moments. it is easy to learn management(its kind of auto). Since these are randomly generated, you won't know what to expect to happen next each time you start your new game. Lastly, as one tip to n00bs: DO NOT buy any anime less you fancy starving to death. You'll see what I mean.\n        Graphically, the game excels. As I said in my UnderTale review, the graphics here also carry that \"delicious\" look to them. This, in conjunction with the music, creates some darn well effective atmosphere. I should elaborate on the music\": its great. The tracks perfectly emphasize the mood of the game: one minute, you're like a bawss; the next, you're depessed as heck. On their own, though, the ost is still top tier.\n        One last thing I should mention that unfortunately makes or breaks this game: the game is a troll. I am serious. The game itself is a troll. This, of course, leads to hysterical moments, but it can get old after a while. And when I mean get old, I mean OLD. Eventually, you'll get sick of hearing that your characters die after stubbing their toe. Events like these happen all the time. I can see how casuals would flee from this game thanks to its often unforgiving difficulty, where every mistake has a brutal consequence. What can be a very enjoyable aspect of the game is unfortunately also its hubris.\n         Overall, Death Road to Canada is yet another fantastic RPG on Steam. With satisfying gameplay, good visuals and music, and a successful take at the zombie genre, it is a fun experience all around. Though the game's trollish side can alienate the player, one perseverant enough can deal with this issue and appreciate the humor behind it. \nMy Score: 8.5/10(Great)", "timestamp_created": 1507426688, "timestamp_updated": 1507426688, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.681896", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35558307": {"recommendationid": "35558307", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992552621", "num_games_owned": 225, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 1657, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509150495}, "language": "english", "review": "Death Road To Canada is a fun and very funny rogue-lite that is well worth the price. \n\nMost of the game will be spent scavanging, moving around the map killing zombies and taking any supply that isnt nailed down.

If you enjoy pixel art and 2D games, go for it. It's not a masterpiece in the art-style but it does the job and is enjoyable.\n\nCustomizing your own characters with traits and perks is pushing the immersion on a personal side which is great.\nYou can pretty much create any kind of characters with all the personality traits, perks and customizations available.\nI created two characters that looks like friends of mine,  a buffed Roady and berserked D-Bag, a Ninja-like character and, well, myself in two different ways. That's neat. Could create a lot more and it's fun to try and deal with all these different possibilities of personalities. \n\nThe gameplay is divided in two segment, on the road and on foot.\nOn the road, you'll be given choices to deal with and locations to choose from in text format while seeing your car rolling or your character(s) running on the road in the background.\nOn foot, you can control your characters using the weapons available that you've collected, smashing through hoards of zombies to find loot you'll need to continue your journey. The hitboxes are alright and the way you don't get hurt on contact is a lot of fun to deal with... when you're not swarmed and where it's impossible to escape\nBut hey! Sh*t happens! The name of the game is there for a reason.\n\nThe story is always the same but it's the adventure that counts the most, stuff that is happening on the road, a character you cherished just died in front of your eyes, recruting random characters or ones that you customized yourself, like if you're finding an old friend.\n\nThe music is alright but not that memorable other than the main title theme.\nIt can get kind of repetitive in the long run but it's not that annoying either.\n\nIn overall, It's a lot of fun!\n\nIf you're already into indie titles, pixel art and such, I do recommend it.\nIf you're not into these kind of games, you know what to do.

Even dogs have their own events. \n\n+ Lots of variations: Characters can be randomized, creating different scenerios and outcomes\n\n+ Dogs!! You can play as a dog, OR have a dogo companion. \n\n+ Customizable characters: Have fun putting yourself in the game...and see how long you last. \n\n+ Humor: There's a bit of humor incoporated into the game, making it fun to play. \n\nCons:\n- Really, the only con I can think of is that once you reach Canda, it sort of loses the replability and challenge. Reaching Canda took me 60+ hours to do though.\n", "timestamp_created": 1505071338, "timestamp_updated": 1505071338, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.711520", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34855419": {"recommendationid": "34855419", "author": {"steamid": "76561198154340158", "num_games_owned": 22, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 769, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512311202}, "language": "english", "review": "amazing and good", "timestamp_created": 1505028470, "timestamp_updated": 1505028470, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34833574": {"recommendationid": "34833574", "author": {"steamid": "76561198172512857", "num_games_owned": 36, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 113, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510218117}, "language": "english", "review": "good game", "timestamp_created": 1504951158, "timestamp_updated": 1504951158, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34829693": {"recommendationid": "34829693", "author": {"steamid": "76561198155881956", "num_games_owned": 22, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 429, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506145924}, "language": "english", "review": "An easily acessible version of DnD set in a post appocalyptic wasteland?

Why? Well...\n\nThe game is a large and very comical zombie road trip simulator that almost never takes itself too seriously. It's like Organ Trail if the point was to get to Canada instead of Oregon and you deal with everyone being a jerk while fighting through an endless flood of zombies. You try your best to go from the bottom of Florida to Canada while scavanging food, fuel, and weapons to survive until then. So, yeah, same old stuff.\n\nBut...\n\nThere's a lot more that seperates DRTC from the overwhelming majority of zombie survival simulations (excluding Organ Trail). For one, it's a rougue-like, which means it's so hard that you are almost never going to beat this game unless you are blessed with the luckiest Irish blood in all of the world (or just lucky). It's also filled with an ENOURMOUS plethora of weapons, road scenarioes, and various characters, including characters from games and movies, to generic pop culture people, several animals, the infinite random generator, and any more you create yourself. There's a great selection of comedic situations and dialogue options that may at least give you a few genuine laughs. Plus, since that huge anniversary update, there's almost no bugs and plenty more stuff in general to enjoy.\n\nHowever, this game may frustrate you or leave you without any smiles, depending on your opinion of these types of games. So, if you don't enjoy humor along the lines of the following scenario, then you have been warned.\n\n\"Your group has been ambushed by a group of bandits who're asking for all of your stuff or else they're gonna beat you up. How do you respond?\"\n\nA. Fred knew this was coming - \"Fred, since he's paranoid, saw this a mile away. While everyone else went on ahead, he came around in the car for a double ambush! The bandits are so surprised, that they run off while you drive away.\"\n\nB. Dave tells them to 'COOL IT!' - \"Because telling someone to 'cool it' has never worked in the history of ever, the bandits become so enraged that they begin to beat up Dave mercilessly. Since he was already injured, Dave dies. The bandits, preoccupied, ignore the rest of your group as they drive away.\"\n\nC. The Last Bodybuilder challenges them to a POSE OFF! - \"The leader of the bandits, a large and burly guy, steps up. The Last Bodybuilder was hardly able to break a sweat as the bandit leader slinks off in shame and lets you guys through.\"\n\n**I am not quoting this exactly, I am guessing from memory!!!**\n\nBesides that, my final verdict is this: it's a great game that has a childish and endearing sense of humor, a well designed character roster, and many great qualities that make it quite fun if you don't try to play to win. So, yeah, it's alright, and as long as you have a similar sense of humor, then it should make for a fun few weekends' worth of good times.\n\n7/10, It's alright.", "timestamp_created": 1504643294, "timestamp_updated": 1504643413, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34747902": {"recommendationid": "34747902", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066272640", "num_games_owned": 148, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 909, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507395476}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u592a\u597d\u73a9\u4e86\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1504576886, "timestamp_updated": 1504576886, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34745934": {"recommendationid": "34745934", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086770623", "num_games_owned": 43, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 920, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506297666}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is just tons of fun to play, especially with a friend. Just finished making it to Canada my first time and the feeling of accomplishment and success were very much at the forefront of my mind upon crossing the border. At times the game can be downright hilarious with moments of funny and bizarre comedy spread throughout the loose, emergent narrative. There are multiple narrative junctions in which you must make decisions and choose certain outcomes for various members of your party. Depending upon group composition this can lead to some surprising, funny or downright terrible outcomes depending on your luck. \n\nThe game is surprisingly slow at times giving the player time to plan and talk amongst friends or themselves adding an enjoyable layer of strategy and depth to what would be a mindless top down shooter otherwise. DRtC also features an intuitive and integral item scavening system in place that adds constant tension throughout as you juggle between items/weapons on you at any given moment. \nYou must constantly be aware of your supplies. Food, gas, meds, etc. all share the same pool for the party and must be balanced and incessantly managed, especially on the harder/ longer game modes. DRtC's art style is colorful and detailed with most character models being distinct and very stylistic, especially those that are more hidden or of the easter-egg variety. The game also boasts a rockin, chip-tune soundtrack that makes your zombie slaying that much more enjoyable. \n\nOverall, I had more fun than I ever expected and plan to play more, hopefully with friends again. My only complaints are the lack of enemy types; different kinds of zombies/infected would have been an added bonus. Also, the lack of an online functionality is surprising as I don't always have access to a friend sitting next to me to play... at least not nowadays. Hopefully this is something the devs will add in the future perhaps.\n\nRegardless, for 15 bucks it's worth the cash.

It has comedy (get irritating perk and spam usage), epic zombie splatting with a pretty big variety on weapons, skills that make keeping survivors alive very recommended, a huge variety of locations (along with rare locations with special loot/effects), 2 player local co-op, and 10 gamemodes to put it in a summary. A potato can run this game, and a potato can win this game. I honestly do not see the trouble people have, because the game only becomes borderline impossible by the last 4 gamemodes. Anyhow, the only reason to not buy the game is there is no online multiplayer. Besides that, 10/10 would get eaten alive again because I forgot to bring my chainsaw. If you go into the game though, a few pieces of advice:\n\n1. Set up custom characters, probably 1 to two dozen. They are MUCH better than random characters. This helps a lot with getting a balanced team!\n\n2. Don't forget your unlocks on the main screen! This becomes very important because you spend points for beating events on the long road to get better perks and traits\n\n3. Only take as many people/guns as you need! The more people you recruit, the more food you need, the less weapons/ammo you can buy at traders, and the more guns you bring to sieges/looting events, the less ammo you have, only use it when you need it or you will run out!\n\n4.

For DRtC it's a 4/5, a mot definetely would recommend. The only thing I would ask the developers to do is to add multiplayer co-op, for a guy who knows little to nothing on how to make or develope a game, I do understand that adding this would be a challenge considering the game is already made for solo play, but this I feel would increase replayability a whole lot, I can't even imagine how many hours I'd have on this game if that were the case, its also worth saying that DRtC would be a 5/5 is this were to be added.

BUT- oh yeah i got a new computer\u2026     - Ten hours later -\nSo apparently everything reset so i just have to play the game\u2026 \nI start with Aida, An Oblivious Car Nut and her pal Jeri a yet, Oblivious again, Surgeon, And they didn\u2019t come prepared, they have a broom and a scalpel with Two Flashlights, so Aida hears a rumor about Canada being free of zombies (i see what you did there, they say canada is peace ;) ) And there's HINTS!    - One hours of button pushing later - Ok lets go! I go on a house on the road because hey, everyone randomly comes in random houses\u2026 I like the ability on how i can skip\u2026 i would have wasted hours if it wasn\u2019t there, so i take all the loot (80 minutes, game times\u2026) and i protect and adore a chair for Two hours black one to be specific, its leather is surely satisfying the leather feels smooth, and i love the metal bars, i love metal it eases my anger hitting it\u2026 and the armrests are metal\u2026 surely a sight to be seen\u2026 and 30 minutes in the middle of it (game time) I BREAK IT so i go to adore and protect another chair.. This time it was wooden\u2026 like, i like the rough- OKAY THAT'S IT I'M OUT\u2026 *kills self* now you can see how amazing this gamepla-  \u201c...\u201d i have another guy left\u2026 i forgot\u2026 so i grab the loot my dead self dropped and get out of there\u2026 her morale increases for some reason annndddd she gets hurt by a bunch of zombies\u2026 great so she goes to a place that has a dog\u2026 annnnddd okay\u2026 i think i\u2019ve seen enough\u2026 *kills everyone* as you can see, going on a suicidal mission isn\u2019t good but if you play the actually game\u2026 it\u2019s pretty good.. I\u2019m pretty sure it's meant to be hardcore SO PEOPLE STOP GIVING IT A THUMBS DOWN JUST BECAUSE IT IS HARDCORE\u2026 excause me, sorry\u2026 so anyway the gameplay easily gets a 4 \n\n       ~Controlls~\nEverything is not perfect\u2026 so let me explain the controls\u2026 so you use the arrow keys to move instead of the wasd keys and i thought to myself \u201cOh boy\u2026 it's going to be one of those games (luckily it wasn\u2019t\u2026)\u201d like really THE ARROW KEYS, it gets you confused when your a gamer and you play this\u2026 and you use zxc and esc to do actions\u2026 like now, this is just reminding me of the dolphin emulator, (Which i have by the way\u2026) so i give the controls a  \u2026 -3\u2026 I don\u2019t like the controls\n       ~Sounds~\nSame as the graphics\u2026 \n\n\n       ~Conclusion~\nSo, yeah..

This is a game that is fun to play with yourself and even more so with friends. This is a game that is equal parts brutal and unforgiving as much as it is humorous and rewarding. It's a game that is mediated through pixel art and yet manages to be relatively detailed. It's a game that blends side-scrolling beat'em ups, zombies, rouge-likes, and even survival to a certain extent. It's a game that even when you're doing well, a single wrong choice can send you through a downward spiral that you MIGHT be able to recover from if you play your cards right. It's a game that you can get better at and even master yet can still die in but a few days like the myriads of other playthroughs if you're not careful. It's a game you can play for hours and hours and still refuses to become stale. It's a game that is still being impoved, built upon, and updated as I write this review.

If you know Organ Trail you can imagine a lot of what is going on here, but the game replaces many text passages with in character momenty where your party scavanges actively for items, food and weapons... maybe even other survives. The game does this reasonably well be it not perfect but its fun, and rather challanging at times too! \n\nThe game has a rather... interesting sense of humor to not say \"dank\" because the memes here are all over the place. Some of the jokes are very random or just plain stupid in a good way. This also means tho that its not as serious as Organ Trail is. Not even remotely. This sadly broke the atmosphere a bit for me, because the dire feeling of fleeing an undead nightmare was much more present in the basically imageless Organ Trail than here, even when the hordes of zombies should to the same. But in fact they don't always... bring the atmosphere i believe they were trying to make. This game is as far as im aware also involved in the Alex Maurer-Controversy... and as far as i am concerned i wouldn't put my name on that soundtrack since it just... didn't feel very interesting to me. Anyway...\n\nSpeaking of things i don't like: The game is roguelike. In the sense that many things can kill you and when your character died they are dead for good and the next in the party takes their role. If all of them die, the game is over. Characters can not only die on missions tho - and here is the part that annoys me a bit - but also die in random events... And sometimes i wasn't even aware there was any possibility of dying. While i had a great laugh at what happened there... the fact that my character got \"flexed out of existence\" was turning my playthrough from a decent, succesful run into absolute shitstorm even with the addition of another strong character. The RNG is a bit to strong at play here at times.

Do you enjoy a hard game that doesn't take itself too seriously and eases the tension with silly moments, parodies, and just a general sense of fun? Do you like dogs? Not specific breeds, just in general?\n\nIf not, feel free to move on. It's not an easy game, and not for everyone, especially not for people who hate dogs. There's nothing wrong with that.\n\nDeath Road to Canada is about survivors from Florida trying to escape to Canada in a zombie apocalypse setting. There's a character creation system with a LOT of slots to save to (I believe 80) with perks and traits to make everyone unique and useful. You can run into and recruit these custom characters just like anyone else in the game, and there's even a game mode to increase the odds of running into your people instead of other ones. In addition, there's also unique characters, many of which are parodies, and some of them may surprise you.\n\nThere's a very real sense of progression and resource management as you start off with barely a stick to your name and slowly acquire better weapons and ammo for said weapons - ammo you can't waste because then said weapons are useless to you. Your characters also have chances to become stronger, better mechanics, and the like over the course of the journey as well. Stronger and more fit characters can swing weapons around without tiring as fast, and characters can become so fatigued that they're easily overwhelmed. You need to play smart. Keep moving, save your ammo, and know when using it will make the difference between life and death.\n\nIt's never too stressful simply since the game is amusing. The comedy basically runs damage control and keeps you entertained even when things look bleak or even if you just died, with one of my favorite game over screens ever. I want to give examples. I want to give them SO MUCH. But I also don't want to ruin the surprises that lay in store, and there's so many great moments that I can't decide what to pick! If you don't care about spoilers, you may as well check the Screenshots in the Community Hub.\n\nAs for the fairness of the game... knowledge is power. Even when bad events happen back to back, knowing what each choice does makes it far easier to mitigate. For example, if bandits are trying to rob your team, fighting will always result in people getting hurt, no matter how strong and well-trained you may think your team is. As such, you learn to go \"Okay, low on health, fighting will be bad, what about the other options?\" Depending on your team, you may even find new options based on their skills and personalities - options to completely bypass some of the worst outcomes, in some cases! Due to this, every playthrough is different since you need to make different choices depending on the situation, and you'll only learn the best ways to do things through repeated playthroughs.\n\n\nIf this sounds like a good time, then do yourself a favor and give it a try.

Anyways, Lets make a ROADTRIP![/h1]\nDeath Road to Canada is basicly a remake based on \"Oregon trail\" [b]BUT[/b] more \"modern like\". So you actually can better compare it with the game \"Organ Trail: Director's Cut\" here on steam (which is also a remake based on Oregon Trail) since both went with the same theme - The Zomie breakout over the whole world (or at least USA).\n\n[h1]Lets begin our trip[/h1]\nTo be fair here, i have to compare Death Road to Canada with Organ Trail DC since they are \"basicly\" the same. I will here not say one is better then the other, both games are good in their own ways (for the note: I know Organ Trail DC already has  DLC which i didnt own in the time i wrote this review which i know adds a lot stuff).\n\nSo For Death Road to Canada, You actually start your \"trip\" with 1-2 People + their weapons, a standart car + some gas, some food and nearly nothing else. Shortly after you begin, you will actually see already that this game is based on Oregon Trail:\n\nThe typical Street-from-the-side view is the main point you will see very often in the game with all the basic stats on it. You can also go in the \"pause menu\" and look there for more stats like motivation, fitness, loyality and more. This already is one of the bigger changes if you compare it now again with Organ Trail DC: Character personalities.\n\nUnlike Organ Trail DC, Death Road to Canada changes the main factor around the \"only survive part\" to the \"look at the characters\". Each Character has special \"abilities\" and stats. Like someone can be super strong but is grumpy all the time, someone can heal up people way better but is very shy or someone can run like hell but is only able to use firearms. [b]\n ONE of the best parts is[/b] you actually can create your very OWN characters for the Trip.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1091799389\n\nThat already is a [b]HUGE[/b] funfactor for the game since those characters are not only \"Names\" like in Organ Trail DC, you actually give them their own look and personalities, adding a lot possibilitys and replay ability already here.\n\nSure you have still to survive and \"hunt\" for food, ammo, gas and like but unlike the original or Organ Trail DC, its more the great \"main\" part of the game which makes a whole lot fun.\n\nSo if you remember the original / Organ Trail DC, there you have only 1 screen to shoot/collect food and defend yourself of the some enemys which appiers.\nIn Death Road to Canada, if such \"hunt\" happens, you actually walk around a bigger area or house, smashing Zombies with a lot different melee weapons [b]and[/b] firearms which also have their own stats, strengths and weaknesses. As sample, a Woodplank makes a pitty of damage and will easy break wile a hatchet makes good damage, has a chance to hit 2 Zombies, will never break but your character who swings it gets faster tired.\n\n[h1]Its about Zombies but not like a horror movie...[/h1]\nI often already compared Death Road to Canada with Organ Trail DC since they both are based on Oregon Trail and they both use the same theme - But next to [b]Organ Trail DC[/b], Death Road to Canada is more...\"fun to play\". Dont get me wrong here, both are great games but i already reviewd Organ Trail and said in my review there that this game changes the mood from happy into something \"depressive\" like coz the theme and atmosphere of THIS game is like \"The world is in ruin, Zombies are everywhere and you have to survive as good as you can.\"\n\nIn Death Road to Canada, its more like \"The world is in ruin but hey, fuack it! LETS MAKE A ROADTRIP!\"\n\nI mean, just to compare the mood and atmosphere of both said games with the first music you will hear [b]INGAME[/b] (not title music) and you will \"hear\" what i mean:\n\nOrgan Trail DC:\nhttps://youtu.be/AbuklEtC3Yk?t=2m55s\n(hopefully the video starts around 2:55)\n\nDeath Road to Canada\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ps4x67Yu7yQ\n\nThe mood from Organ Trail DC is deep dark and depressive [b]wile[/b] Death Road to Canada has a more like \"its not all SO bad\"-atmosphere. It makes way more fun to go on a trip, smashing Zombies (even together with a friend WITHOUT any DLC), collecting stuff and the funny random events.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1091221607\n\nYes, like the original and Organ Trail DC, Death Road to Canada also has a lot \"random events\" but those are mostly funny explained, giving you at least a small giggle out of it. Its not just like \"You go bid by a Zombie\", even if the \"outcome\" is/could be the same, more like....well, this:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1091221765\n\n\n[h1]Is it a Roadtrip worth to play?[/h1]\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1091221514\n\nIf you like the \"Classic\" [b]oregon trail[/b] and dont want it to change \"a lot\" and can go with a deep and dark mood and atmosphere, you might should go with [b]Organ Trail DC[/b] which is also here on steam. If you also liked the Classic and want it more \"action\" like, way more fun to play and actually the ability to create your own characters with personalities, you [b]sure should go[/b] with Death Road to Canada.\n\nThe game is sure worth its price and makes a lot more fun unlike Organ Trail DC which is more a direct homage to the classic. Death Road to Canada sure uses the core-gameplay of the classic but is more fun to play and the replay abilities are there since you can change your own characters, randomize them and the \"random events\" are not only like \"you lost XY\" or \"you got bid by a Zombie\" but more funny little stories of their own which just happens. If you have also a friend on your side, it makes even more fun.

Everyone is happy.\n- Everyone soon notices that someone farted in our new car. Gil, being such an adept smell-detective, not only figures out who it was but actually 'explains' his deductions in full dog-speech. Everyone (but the farter) is happy.\n- My leader is sporadically eaten after a particularly nasty seige. Gil has now become the group leader, because that is perfectly normal. Everyone is happy.\n- Make it to the outskirts of Canada and are given ample warning that we're nearing the end of our journey. Rather than be smart and trade our goods for weapons of zombie destruction, Gil tells the traders to \"Cool It\". We are kicked out.

It's composed of two main gameplay mechanics, which can be oversimplified as;\n1. The \"Choose Your Own Adventure\" mechanic where you're watching your collective band of jerks on the road making progress to Canada. Here they'll quip at each other in amusing ways, and occasionally run into choices such as who should be the one to get a can of beans off a precarious mountain of garbage, to tell spooky stories while camping, and who should be the brave (and thereafter mortally traumatized) soul of the group to open a box of food which has a piece of dog poo on it.\n2. \"Always Be Looting\" events which you choose to go onto from the CYOA part of the game. It's here where you control your group as sprites to fight zombies and scavenge for necessities. Scav events tend to be quite explanatory without actually explaining what you'll find there, such as you'll have a choice to either go scavenge a gym (likely has sports weapons and possibly working equipment to train fitness/strength stats) or a pet store (will have animals that you might be able to recruit).\n\nThe game repeatedly pivots itself between these two main mechanics in a way that I think keeps both of them fresh and interesting. After a few runs though you're guaranteed start to seeing events/places you've already been to in past runs, but between the goofy antics and playing around with custom character perk/trait combos and finding rare characters to recruit for a run, I think the game holds up to what it's worth.\n\nA dev frequents the steam forum too, and as of this review seems to be pretty enthusiastic about making updates (new rare characters, weapons, cheevos, areas, events, sprite customizations) for the future.

Death Road To Canada is basically Oregon Trail in a zombie apocalypse with a quirky sense of humor that you can easily sink hours into playing. While RNG plays a big role in the game, your skill can turn a bad run around and make a good run last all the way to Canada.\n\n[h1]Pros:[/h1]\n[b]+The gameplay is well executed, and there's loads of variety.[/b] While the game is somewhat difficult, you're given many tips and pointers when progressing to help you improve your strategy and create characters that will get you to Canada. If you're looking for a challenge, there's multiple hard modes that push you to the limit, such as having the trip take twice as long or even having double the zombies throughout the entire journey. [spoiler] I will beat KEPA mode someday.[/spoiler] When fighting zombies, the outcome is reliant on your skill and what you can do with the materials at hand - sure, the game's much easier if you have an automatic weapon and a lot of ammo, but you have to use it wisely as not only is it quick to use up your stock but also you're limited on how much you can carry for each gun. Being able to create yourself, family, friends, and characters from different forms of media makes the game a lot more enjoyable and leads to lots of different outcomes and situations. \n[b]+The humor of this game is what really sets this apart from games of the like.[/b] The overall experience of this game is far more enjoyable thanks to the jokes and special characters you can encounter, making the overall zombocalpyse a lot less depressing. Just take a glance over some of the other reviews here to get a taste of the comedy this game has to offer.\n[b]+The game designer is constantly interacting with players in the forums, listening to their feedback, and working to add more content and improve upon existing content.[/b] It's always delightful to see creators working with their audience as it shows how much they care about what they've made and the experience that people get from it. Kepa is a pretty chill dude who really seems to enjoy what he does, and I have a lot of respect for all that he's done (and continues to do) with the game.\n[b]+The soundtrack has some pretty catchy tunes that add on to the tone of the game.[/b] Rigor Mortis Rag is no doubt my favorite track. \n\n[h1]Cons:[/h1]\n[b]-There's a few minor issues with the gameplay that are flaws on otherwise flawless gameplay.[/b] Sharing ammo with other players is an all-or-nothing task. There's no way to evenly distribute ammo or split it 70-30 if you want to give yourself more - a character is given as much ammo as possible when equipping a weapon before combat. During combat, switching weapons with a character will give them all of the ammo on you for that weapon, and taking the weapon back will take all the ammo from the other character. Implementing a way to choose the amount of ammo each character can carry before combat would really help with this. There's also the issue of fighting tactics being a switch for everyone, not being individual switches, meaning that you couldn't have one person not fight to recharge while everyone else fights to help you out. CPUs will also drop items such as explosives and healing sprays for something else as they cannot use them, which can be inconvient if you want them to carry those for later use. \n[b]-Co-op could be improved.[/b] The second player cannot walk through doors until the first player does, and, if P1 walks through a door and P2 is not nearby, P2 will have to navigate themselves to the door even though they cannot see where they are. Something such as a minimap or splitscreen could improve upon this (although such an improvement would take a lot of effort to implement). It's a rather small issue, but it can lead to taking unnecessary damage since P2 didn't see a zombie in front of them. Online co-op would be nice for the future, but that's also a lot to implement.\n[b]-No SteamCloud.[/b] Since DR2C should be getting an Android/iOS release, a Dropbox would be used to transfer saved data from one device to another, but, as of right now, you'd have to back up your save data if something were to go wrong. \n\n[b]TL;DR:[/b] This game is funny, challenging, and very replayable with each run being different from the last. Chances are if you liked what you saw with the trailer, you'll love this game and get more than $15 worth out of it. It's a game that I highly recommend you get.\n\n[spoiler]I wonder if Kepa-sempai will notice me o3o[/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1500075210, "timestamp_updated": 1500078185, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 43, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.828505", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33541656": {"recommendationid": "33541656", "author": {"steamid": "76561198152696036", "num_games_owned": 84, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 297, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501960014}, "language": "english", "review": "WTF is this Game?!\n\nThis game is soooo random!\n\n-> BUT THAT'S THE COOL THING ABOUT IT!\n\nIt's so much fun to play with friends or alone and the total randomness is so funny and entertaining!\nYou can create your friends and/or family and let them fight / die / or do other weird and/or funny things.\n\nYou never know what will happen at your next try to get to CANADA.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSUMMARY:\n\nPros:\n+totally random and funny as hell\n+always new events\n+you can play it with your friends\n+funny art-style (except you don't like pixel art games)\n+[spoiler]Talking dogs XD[/spoiler]\n\nCons:\n<I haven't found any 'till now, really.>\n\nBUT!

I may recommend to buy other roguelike games if you are trying to get something price-competitive)\n-Random encounter is too random even if you stack up a lot of resources you can easily lose it just by choosing wrong answer. I know that's what roguelike is supposed to be  but it feels so fxxxd up when you lost all your resources that I really tried hard to gather among swarms of zombies just by clicking wrong choices!

Warum, das erkl\u00e4re ich jetzt:\n[h1]Singleplayer[/h1]\nNun, obwohl ich mir das Spiel gekauft habe, weil ich etwas gutes f\u00fcr lokales Co-op wollte, fing ich mit dem Singleplayer an und wurde \u00e4u\u00dferst positiv \u00fcberrascht. Trotz der nahezu unendlichen M\u00f6glichkeiten an Events (Text-Events, Zombiehorden u.s.w.), bringt einem das [b]Tutorial[/b] zuerst nur die Steuerung bei. Dies war f\u00fcr mich am Anfang ein gro\u00dfes Problem, da ich von dem Spiel keine Ahnung hatte und erst nachdem ich 20 mal versagt habe das Spiel verstanden habe.\nDas war allerdings auch nicht so schlimm. Es hat irgendwie Spa\u00df gemacht, jedesmal dazu zu lernen!\n\nZuerst kann man sich Custom Charaktere erstellen. Diese haben zwar nur eine beschr\u00e4nkte Auswahl an optischen M\u00f6glichkeiten, aber ein breites Band an verschiedenen freischaltbaren Perks und Pers\u00f6nlichkeiten. Mit seinem Buddy steigt man dann in ein Auto und sucht auf dem Weg nach Kanada nach Essen, Medizin, Waffen und anderem Zeug. Dies ist nicht immer einfach, da immer mal eben das Auto kaputt gehen kann, oder eine Zombiehorde angreift. Die Gewinnchancen sind hier NIE 100%.\nDas Spiel hat einen ausgezeichneten, angenehmen und aufregenden [b]Soundtrack[/b] und wird selbst nach mehreren Stunden einfach nicht langweilig\n\n[h1]Co-op Modus[/h1]\nLeider hat mich der Co-op Modus extrem entt\u00e4uscht! Das erste Problem war schon, als das Spiel unsere beiden Controller nicht erkannte (jeder hat das Problem), und ich dann auf der Tastatur spielen musste, w\u00e4hrend mein Bruder den Controller bedient hat. Dann gibt es im Spiel einen sogenannten Leader(P1) und einen Follower(P2). Wer den Leader spielt f\u00fchrt alle Aktionen in den Texting-Events aus und \"f\u00fchrt\" quasi das Team. Der Follower wiederum kann sogut wie gar nichts machen, au\u00dfer mit Zombies k\u00e4mpfen. Der Follower kann nichtmal T\u00fcren betreten oder mit anderen Charakteren interagieren. Der 2. Spieler ist (grob ausgedr\u00fcckt) am Arsch! Auch von dem versprochenen \"Splitscreen\" gibt es keine Spur!\n\n[h1]Fazit[/h1]\nEin echt tolles Spiel f\u00fcr den Singleplayer!

This is zombie apocalypse survival meets Oregon Trail in a nutshell, but with so much more to offer than the current videos display. The devs want to pack this game with as much content as possible while avoiding too much micromanagement, and they do this very well. You have a team of four people, randomized, picked up off the side of the road, or customized, and the objective is to make it to Canada. There are many different game modes, which change the kind of events and encounters that occur, and give much replayability. Frequent stops at camps, bunkers, stores, and other locations offer chances at great loot or terrible misfortune. In between stops there's always amusing dialogue and short events that can make or break your journey's success. The music wonderful and creates the perfect atmosphere in every scenario, and as this game still gets very frequent updates, they're always adding more. There's also just the right amount of pop culture references without including so much as to take away from the originality of the game.

I didn't let her rob anyone, as I wanted to play nice, but I will be trying a full crime run later. Later we met \"an anime girl\", of course I let her join. She had a Sailor Moon type wand that she used for melee attacks and to shoot hearts. The 3 of us were happily looting abandoned houses and Y'all Marts until we found a trader camp. At the trader camp my bandit wanted to rob everybody, but instead I opted to spend all of our remaining food on anime goods. The anime vendor gave Jodie-Chan the anime girl some free katanas with our purchases. Unfortunately this is where the trouble started.\n\nHaving no food the moral of the team dropped, though Jodie-Chan believed we would triumph due to the power of her \"LOVE BEAM!!!\". It was not to be. Shortly after this we had to survive for an hour in a small house against waves of zombies. We were able to survive, but all got hurt in the battle. My main character was the first to fall while trying to find food in another Y'all Mart. After that The remaining two had to survive 2 hours, this time against a larger number of more aggressive zombies. Jodie-Chan must have had some anime glitch as she misfired her wand, went bouncing around (killing zombies mind you), before exclaiming \"I didn't mean to do that.\" and then dying.

Part of Death Road to Canada plays like Orgeon Trail: There's special events and encounters that you indirectly navigate through by picking one of a few different choices. and the outcome of the event is based on your character's stats. The other half of DR2C gameplay is played like a rouge-like, as you control one of the characters in your party and loot abandoned cities and run through zombie-infested sewers, all the while making sure you don't run out of gas or food. Now, a problem a lot of people have with this game is that they complain there's too much RNG involoved, and because of that, the only times you win is because of luck. This is not true at all. Yes, it is a hard game. Yes, there's going to be those times when you feel like you were cheated out of a perfect run. However, you learn from those mistakes. When you run into the event you died from on your last run, you realize, \"Oh, I shouldn't do this option because it killed me last time. I'll do this other option instead.\" Another thing that really helps in these types of cases is the character creation, and more specifically the traits and perks. The traits and perks are just added things to your character, that improves somethings, but decreases others. If your the type of dude who's a freaking expert at the combat, but always gets screwed when they encounter bandits, you can create a character with the charming trait, who might be able to cut a deal with those bandits who want all your food. If you feel like if you were just a bit faster, you would be able to juke those zombies, use the travel light perk. Or, if your feeling suicidal, create a character who's a theif and annoying. I guarantee that never has, and never will work. The game is really fun and lighthearted, and there's always new things to learn about.

Despite having a lot in common with many other titles, with its randomized characters, items, events, and locations, it manages to stand out by how it puts them together, while also wrapping it in a legitimately great sense of humor that manages to parody itself without insulting itself.\n\nYou begin the game by choosing a mode that affects things like the game's length and overall difficulty, then taking one or two characters with randomly a selected name, appearance, perk, and a trait, the latter two affecting how the character holds up in a fight or reacts to events that the group runs into, or you can choose from characters you personally make in the custom creator, which allows you to hand-pick each of those attributes yourself. You then have them meet their destiny as they hit the titular road in an attempt to escape a pixely zombie apocalypse. Your overall goal is always the same: Survive the pre-established number of days necessary to reach the border to Canada, and to do so you'll stop at randomly generated locations full of supplies that can help you keep you from becoming zombie chow along the way and prepare you for the inevitable final battle.\n\nWhere Death Road really stands out, though, is in how that journey unfolds. Every single playthrough will have you meet scores of randomly generated characters, pre-made rare characters with mostly set attributes and quirks, and/or the characters you personally created, and together they'll run into an absolute ton of different random events that check those characters' stats, personalities, and abilities to respond to them, often with amusing results. It's almost impossible to go five minutes on the road without laughing at the unapologetic absurdity thrown at you every in-game day, and the sheer volume of events means it's possible to go several times through the game without running into the same one twice. Even if you do have a repeat, the composition of your group means those same events can have wildly different results, as you may have access to new solutions that weren't possible with a prior team... or new disasters.\n\nBetween braving such challenges as defeating bandits in a bodybuilders' pose-off, waking up to your lodge for the night randomly setting itself on fire, or finding out what happens when you toss the team dog into an tetrographic vortex, you'll leave the safety of your car to wade into the shambling hordes, looting what's left of civilization to find food, medical supplies, guns, ammunition, and blunt objects to help you make it another day. These segments test your skill as a player as you ration your characters' bullets and own physical stamina to help you survive, and you'll need to balance even things such as the heft of a weapon with its owner's own fitness and strength stats, or they may not even be able to swing it effectively, potentially leading to an untimely-but-probably-hilarious demise. Even these battles themselves can be hysterical fun; running into a room, hurling a twin bed at a group of undead, and beating them to death with a sledgehammer is one kind of domestic violence everyone can get behind.\n\nUltimately, though, knowing when to shoot, when to swing, when to hold your ground, and even when to cut and run for it is all vital to your survival, and some legitimately exciting and nerve-racking decisions occasionally must be made to ensure your ultimate goal, such as leaving vital supplies behind while an insurmountable wave approaches, or sacrificing a crucial member of the group to allow a path to the otherwise inaccessible car, or even to ditch that car entirely and brave the journey on foot.\n\nAs you may be able to gather, the results often amount to a pretty legitimate challenge. The hordes can be overwhelming, the random events can be cruel, and you may not always find the means, or the personnel, to help you overcome the Death Road easily. Despite this, the game is rarely outright unfair, merciful even at its most merciless, and provided you reasonably strategize in the areas you do have agency over, the random elements will very rarely force you into an inescapable corner. Bad luck will happen, and brain cramps will too, but just about every playthrough is surmountable one way or the other despite both; as long as someone lives to carry on the dream, they should find the means to do so. The most important element is your own ability as a player to do so, and the game almost never takes that from you, an extremely difficult task that some developers don't even bother to take on in the first place, with such excuses as some playthroughs are simply meant to be unwinnable. Death Road does not ascribe to that philosophy, but you may have to adjust your personal strategy now and then regardless.\n\nAnd since we're on the topic of game developers, this proves another area the game surprises in, as they're a highly communicative bunch continually developing the game at an almost absurd rate. Updates are very frequent, full of new events, items, rare characters, and more, and not a single changelog is without them responding to questions and other feedback from their players. This game could have been considered satisfyingly finished months ago, full of replay value, and yet they continue, providing more for the road to throw at you every time you play. The value even at the base asking price of fifteen dollars almost feels like stealing.\n\nIt adds to the game being one of the best examples of this kind of title: it's challenging without being sadistic, it's formulaic without being monotonous, it's silly without being stupid, and it's funny without being a brainless meme storm. It's not perfect -- stamina management can be tedious, especially at low Fitness levels, there may be a few too many outright bad weapons, and the trading system doesn't always give a lot of incentive to give away your food when you're not guaranteed to find more any time soon, and the consequences of not having enough can single-handedly doom a playthrough -- but it does more than enough right, and doesn't outright crush you beneath what it may not do quite as right. Ultimately, Death Road to Canada is everything great about independant games -- while being little of what isn't -- and Rocketcat Games is everything that's great about independant game developers. If a challenging-but-fair, randomly-generated adventure more focused on a raucous good time than navel-gazing has even the slightest hint of appeal to you, you owe it to yourself to put on your tuque and hit the road.\n\nAnd remember: Beware the clown.", "timestamp_created": 1498848121, "timestamp_updated": 1498848121, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33050075": {"recommendationid": "33050075", "author": {"steamid": "76561198093228614", "num_games_owned": 204, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 404, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512872919}, "language": "english", "review": "addictive and unforgiving game at times .. very cute characters. funny combination of a text adventure with actual gameplay. just get the game and support the devlopers you a$$h0le", "timestamp_created": 1498847130, "timestamp_updated": 1498847130, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33047413": {"recommendationid": "33047413", "author": {"steamid": "76561198116073200", "num_games_owned": 180, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1266, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507806205}, "language": "english", "review": "VERY FUN AND HARD, CHallenging", "timestamp_created": 1498842982, "timestamp_updated": 1498842982, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33043390": {"recommendationid": "33043390", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073050877", "num_games_owned": 97, "num_reviews": 66, "playtime_forever": 1547, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487554566}, "language": "english", "review": "Fuck off, this game is good\n\nThis game is really good\n\nI don't wanna spoil it\n\nBut it's damn good.", "timestamp_created": 1498836807, "timestamp_updated": 1498836807, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33030305": {"recommendationid": "33030305", "author": {"steamid": "76561198171033130", "num_games_owned": 194, "num_reviews": 91, "playtime_forever": 4169, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511840918}, "language": "english", "review": "Was originally disgruntled to find this game discounted to still be over ten dollars, but it is well worth it.\n\nThe game combines Rogue-like random map generation, haphazard disposable equipment and permanent death with Role-Playing character creation, character statistics and gameplay choices as well as various random text and gameplay events to create an exceptionally fun and replayable road trip simulation.\n\nThe combat, while very simple, is enjoyable and even strategic in the players ability to use furniture as both weapons and tactical blockades which do actually work. The zombies are highly varied in terms of appearance and are very weak on their own, as they should be, but primarily become a threat in hordes. And the computer controlled follower behaviour is top tier; followers smartly weave through environmental obstacles to follow the player and they will quickly disengage from combat if the player does as well. Players even being able to set followers to favour certain fighting styles. This makes followers absolutely no hassle or hindrance to have around which is something that many full production games fail to even do. The programming for the zombies themselves is actually quite dynamic, especially in that if the player leaves their line of sight they will wander towards where they last saw the player. Allowing for various strategic baits and dupes.\n\nCatering to multiple different playstyles with individual character perks largely impacting random gameplay elements, the game has a very healthy amount of randomization. Including a variety to everything from the weapons, character appearances, text events, gameplay events and areas along with an absolutely smashing final battle to make it extremely replayable.\n\nThe primary downside to the game is that it can be very brutal at times, like most Rogue-likes, and will just wipe the player out with no mercy. While this more often can be avoided by making good or hard choices, it is still a possibility which may frustrate some players. But this is a relatively common aspect of randomly generated permanent death games. But unlike others, experience will eventually allow players to overcome a lot of problems and avoid brutal deaths; which is especially useful for the variety of higher difficulty modes the game has to offer.\n\n\nIn all, a fantastic addition to the indie genre and a champion of everything high quality indie games excel at. Charm, fun and replayability.

I could go on but what I really want to talk about is my first successful trip to Canada.\nI started off with my Wife's character Arwen who never got Tired and had an affinity for taming dogs. My plan was to go solo and raise an army of pooches to do my bidding.\nThings were looking good after the second day as Arwen had already made a Dog friend and supplies were looking good but the next day we got caught in a Zombie siege and the pooch didn't make it.\nWorse, the next day the car ran out of gas and Arwen suffered nothing but bad luck until she was out of food, medical supplies and ammo. Then, through the power of positive thinking (Not my words) Arwen somehow raised her depleted moral back to full and soldiered on!\nShortly after she found a Car and just barely escaped with it and her life.\nThen as she was driving along A weird vortex appeared ahead in the road. Arwen inspected this and decided that a living being could pass through it without fatal effects. Feeling things weren't looking that good Arwen drove into the vortex and emerged as newrA! Not only had her gender chanced but all her stats had been revered! She, Now He, Had gone from an Optimist with terrible survival skills and strength into a pessimistic beefcake!\nThis was made all too clear when he picked up a lead pipe in the next scavenger mission as preceded to decimate the undead!\nShortly after newrA met Jennifer on the road. Jennifer proofed herself to be a major asset to the team with some of the best insight and composure I'd ever seen. It was a match made in heaven. newrA would fight, shoot or heal them out of trouble while Jennifer was the girl who had a plan for everything and was always dead calm.\nThe journey continued steadily with no deaths and we picked up another survivor, my own Character Tom I created with my Wife the previous day.\nThen came the Holy Grail: At a trader camp newrA found a merchant selling what he claimed was the greatest sword of all time demanding a whopping 50 units of food for it. We only had 35 and I was skeptical so I choose the option to ask for a demonstration.\nHe accompanied us on our next mission: Save a survivor from a zombie infested mall. My god I was sold on this sword! The merchant was mowing down wave after wave with it all the time talking like a 2:00am Infomercial salesman! Thankfully the mall was packed with food so I managed to collect the 50 but at the end to make sure I was completely satisfied he offered a 33% discount and threw in a second one for free.\nI kept expecting the sword to break but it proved indestructible though it was exhausting to wield. \nThere were a couple of close calls a few times but the sword proved amazingly powerful! We picked up an otaku survivor to fill out our party and even though we changed cars 6 times due to running out of gas (Everything from a sooped up mussel car to a giant hot dog!) we managed to get withing 3 driving days of Canada!\nThen we met a man on the road names Nimbus Ordeal with spiky blonde hair carrying a Guster Sword. \nThe otaku was promptly kicked out of the car and Nimbus Ordeal joined our ranks.\nAs overpowered as I felt we still nearly fell in the last few missions but our swords, shotguns, uzis and grenades saw us through!\nTHAT WAS JUST ONE STORY! \nEveryone will be different! \nGet the game and share yours!", "timestamp_created": 1498580920, "timestamp_updated": 1498581088, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 41, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.822307", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32852460": {"recommendationid": "32852460", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003227119", "num_games_owned": 179, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 612, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500438225}, "language": "english", "review": "They should have turned to Mexico the moment they find out that the further they head north, the thicker the horde becomes,  :D\n\nAnd Canada is so fucking faraway!!!", "timestamp_created": 1498565016, "timestamp_updated": 1498565016, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526954", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32846464": {"recommendationid": "32846464", "author": {"steamid": "76561198147455866", "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 639, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504992503}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a corny, adventerous, and difficult game built for those who inheret both luck and skill.

I chose the option to help out the city that was being attacked and it turned out that some girl just got stuck inside of a rubber dinosaur costume.\n-The daughter of Thor came down from the heavens and proclaimed, \"I am here to help you on your quest to Canada! It's not a big deal.\"\n-My team found a hotdog car. That was pretty cool.\n-I almost died in a graveyard because of my \"obsession with goblins.\"\n-I gave Elvis Presley an Uzi and he was surprisingly good at using it!\n-One of my friends joined my team and at one point he asked, \"How about a sing-along?\" My character responded, \"How about a shut up-along?\"\n-I found Cloud Strife and discovered his name was \"Nimbus Ordeal.\" I would be lying if I said I didn't laugh.\n-I played with one of my friends and I told him that we would definitely lose. ...We ended up winning.\n-When I reached Canada, a giant Canadian robot appeared singing \"O' Canada!\"\n-Best of all, I was made an honorary citizen of Canada!

I bought it at full price ($15) and it was so worth it. This game has a ton of content that at 102 hours I still haven't tapped into. It's mostly rare characters and achievements. You get them just by playing, so I just need to put some more hours into it. I've seen ratings of people who say the games terrible because they haven't beat the game. This game is Randomly generated and anything can happen. I haven't made it to Canada yet but I usually get to the final siege, right before the end. I've had some runs where I get tons of food and not many good weapons, or I'll get runs with amazing weapons, tons of medical, and very little food. Control wise, they're simple, and that's what's nice about them. The graphics are very nice. The game also downloads very quickly. When I was about to download it I was ready for a long 2 or so hours, it took like 30 seconds. I closed steam and opened Chrome, and it was already installed. It was amazing. \n\nThere are a lot of random encounters and things that happen. This game has a lot of replayability. Random encounters, rare characters, and achievements.  This game was worth paying full price. All you have to do is play it to unlock things.

You're a survivor in a outbreak, who makes a idea to travel to Canada where it is safe!\n\nGameplay is simple, in the car, the game is  automatic during this time, only thing you do is make choices, which is something that can affect the lives of yours and the other survivors. Like resouces, weapons, saving someone from death, killing someone, giving the devil a pizza flavoved snack and more!\n\nSome point you'll see a choice to where to go, these are the locations where you and your buddies go slay zombies and collect items, make sure to do these. Entering the area changes the game into a Beat Em Up, you explore the area, beat up zombies, find items and make choices with certain things. People can get bit by the zombies, they have normaly have three health, but some perks and events can change this. When someone dies, they died the whole game. So be careful. anytime you want you can use the car to drive off! Make sure to find as many items as posible.\n\nLets get into character making, you can change the gender, hair style, skin tone, cloths, name etc. But the main thing is perks and traits. Perks give bonuses while traits change how the character works.

Something can always go wrong, and sometimes you can do nothing to avoid it.\n\nIf you've ever played Oregon Trail, it's slightly similar. The game shifts between actual gameplay, which consists of exploring randomly generated \"towns\" with randomly generated \"buildings\" you can enter, explore, and loot, and driving in a car (no gameplay) on your road to Canada and this is where the unknown element comes in.\n\nYour characters can argue amongst each other, or you can run into a group of bandits who'll demand all your supplies, or you get jumped by a horde of zombies, etc. These random encounters will debilitate your squad. Thus, as I mentioned earlier, there is a large element of luck involved in actually completing a successful playthrough as even the most well prepared can still die from one random encounter. Many if not most or even all of these random encounters can be \"dealt with\" if you have the required skill check (for example, if your car breaks down, but you have a high level mechanic, then you can fix the car) but chances are you won't, as each character is able to specialize in maybe one or two skills and there are countless random encounters the game has to choose from. This unexpectedness and dynamic story-telling is good (towns and buildings and runs are always different and new) in some ways, but it's TOO uncontrollable. It can really make you feel powerless at times and, again, unfair. In my opinion, much of the gameplay is too reliant on RNG and not actual skill and knowledge of the game.\n\nAll in all it's a solid game with good features. You can make your own survivor, complete with cute aesthetics and a special set of positive and negative traits to choose from to really give your character some personality. Gameplay is also well-balanced and flows well. Perfect balance between quick, casual, jump in jump out play sessions, and also long, intense, gaming marathons. At the beginning, when you're first getting used to the mechanics, you will get party-wiped pretty often, so you don't have to invest too much time as you'll be restarting every few minutes however once you're comfortable and surviving longer, single runs can last up to 90, 120, even 180 minutes. Sound short? Well like I said you'll die a lot, so getting that far is an achievement in itself, and plus it's designed to have maximum replayability so you'll surely sink many hours into this title.\n\nMuch funner with a friend. With co-op in mind, this definitely gets a thumbs up from me. \n\n78/100\n\nPS follow \"Convert Your Significant Other!\" or CoYoSiOt, my Steam Curator page, if you're interested in finding good games with an emphasis on cooperative play and accessibility to convert your significant other!

But this game is deeper than that. It really has a lot of heart that I really wasn't paying attention to the first time around. Not the characters really, but the sound, the way everything is written. It's a zombie apocalypse (obviously) and yet it is so upbeat and chipper. The graphics look like something that you'd play on a Commodore 64 and honestly, they're absolutely perfect for this game. \n\nMy only real gripe with the game is that it completely and utterly lacks complexity.

And what is it with players of said \"roguelikes\" that makes them see a game with 0.0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001% chance of winning as a good game, that's worthwhile spending the time to play? \n\nIn older, wiser days we used to pass on games with such terrible odds, as a bag of broken bollocks that no reasonabley sensible person would even bother spending their ever dwindling days trying to get through. We'd just say, \"bugger that\". And toddle off to the next, more playable thing. \n\nYet somehow by some shear chance these digital masochist simulators have taken a foothold in our hearts. And we rate them equally alongside games that are actually playable and more importantly, games that you can actually [b]finish[/b]. \n\nAnd with that said, I know I may have lead you slightly askew with those opening paragraphs. BUT ! I have to say [b]Death Road to Canada[/b] is nothing short of fantastic. Being somewhat of a zombie survival simulator and is to the genre what your average chihuahua is to the whole canine geneology. It still does the same thing, barks at random stuff, hates anything that's smaller and faster than it. And will shit in your kitchen at any opportunity. It still has the same content but on an amazingly compressed scale. \n\nAnd it's all the better for it. Like a single player cartoon version of Day Z. You will run around, go places, loot places, meet other survivors, some will join your small group (you can have upto 3 companions), find vehicles which will ultimately either break down or you will run out of fuel; Forcing you to go a little of the way on foot (at least until you find another car, which is usually not that long from where you were forced to abandon your last vehicle), And you will be vulnerable to a loss of morale and even starvation if you run out of food. \n\nThe gameplay itself is split into two variants. The sections where you are on the road, driving along minding your own business as you are repeatedly hammered with Randomly generated situations. Which are presented to you in boxes of text. These situations are rarely beneficial or good for you or your group. Sometimes they are, but mostly you will be getting shat on from on high. Which can be terribly frustrating, especially if your supplies are beginning to get a little thin. But it will be guaranteed that all situations will be quirky, funny and brilliantly entertaining. \n\nThe other section comes in variety of top-down locations for you to explore, trade and meet other survivors. These locations are also generated randomly and come in the form of trading posts, urban areas (with houses and shops and such), supermarkets, shopping malls and a huge array of other areas where you desperately run around trying to grab as many supplies as possible. All before you are surrounded and swamped by the walking dead. Horde size varies with each encounter as does the way they act towards you. I mean, they're always trying to eat you and such. But sometimes they will be idle and sluggish. And on other occasions the dead will be ravenous and hunt you down at a pace that is awesomely scary, considering the games' retro aesthetic.\n\nAll in game mechanics are really simple and presented beautifully. Such as the flushing of your tiny characters faces when they are tiring from beating zombies to a literal exploding mush. Your characters stats are simple and easy to understand, but improving those stats to make your group members better at certain skills, will be more than a little difficult. And that's IF you can keep them alive long enough to do so.\n\nYour characters are randomly generated at the start of the game (normal mode), as well as a buddy, should you choose to start with one. Or you can create your own characters to ride to Canada with. You have quite a few different save slots with which to create your survivors and any that you don't start with have a slight chance of turning up on your journey, which you can then have join your group. There's even some special appearences of more familiar faces and random special characters. In one playthrough I came across a wonderful cheeky rip-off of [b]Link[/b] from the [b]Zelda[/b] games. And then on another occasion I hired a gnarly old witch at a camp site. All specials do seem to kick more than your average ass and are always worth taking on as a member. There's also dogs to invite here and there. Cats too, and I'm sure there's even a goat to take onboard. Though I haven't personally come across one as yet.\n\nTop all this off with a massive array of weapons, vehicles and zombies to smash, shoot or run over and you've got a phenomenal recipe for fun and frolics in the zompocalypse.\n\nThe music is fast paced, bright and fun, completely offsetting the dismal subject matter. All adding to what is a proper fun title to have in your library. This is very much the [b]Z Nation[/b] of zombie video games.\n\nHowever. Carrying on from my opening words, I do feel that the harsh RNG nature can kill the fun of it a little. As you can just be hammered and hammered and hammered and hammered, from start until death. Which starts to get a bit off putting after a while. As you can start to feel that your gametime is a completely pointless venture. Which is a shame as everything else works so beautifully together. As I've been playing I have had reminicent flashbacks of [b]Secret of Mana[/b] (or [i]Seiken Densetsu 2[/i] if you're going to be a picky purist lol). There's just something there that reminds me heavily of that legendary game. But still that RNG does unfortunately dampens the spirit somewhat. And it's because of this that I'm a bit doubtful of getting behind a positive recommendation 100%.\n\nBut yeah. If you see it on sale and want to give it a go, then do so. It is incredible fun while you're not getting beaten down by events that are completely out of your control. Events that no amount of player skill can overcome. But try it anyway, see if you can make the 15 day journey to the Canadian border. It's sure to be one heck of a ride.

It doesent tell you what to expect, its always fresh and no run is the same as the last! The final seige is easily avoidable with a chainsaw and its simple enough.

compared to the mass of other zombie related titles out there. as many other reviews have stated this game comes across like Oregon trail in a modern zombie apocalypse. with different game modes you can range from the semi realistic approach and even make friends and family to include as characters you can recruit in your party. or you can have a playthrough where you can get murderous clowns, a link alternative, a sailor moon knockoff and anything in between. the game is great at not taking itself too seriously especially with some of the travel banter between characters. \n\ngameplay while simplistic is a lot of fun. theres something satisfying about hulking out and throwing a couch at a horde of zombies and knocking them all down either for the get away or an easy cleanup. the game does have a ton of depth however due to its rogue like nature and replay value is throguh the roof. \n\nmy only complaint is just some more variety in a couple of regards. for example while i havent had a successful trip yet thanks to some very challenging sieges I've had several repeat encounters and locations. though it does look like the devs have been great at adding content which is awesome.

Slow zombies only, as it should be.  One or two?  Trivial.  A crowd?  Impossible.  Super simple, straightforward gameplay that gets deeper with every new situation.  Navigating a crowd is seat-of-the-pants excitement.  How big a horde will you dare to get one more can of food?\n\n* Resource management - Fantastic.  The balance is [b]just right[/b].  You'll always need more gas, more food, more bullets, more medicine, because you're always running out ... but with luck, there's always an opportunity to get more.  Low on meds?  That drugstore is a good place to loot - but then you pass up the opportunity to look for groceries.  Maybe it's time to leave someone behind so there's one less mouth to feed - but then your team will lose fighting strength.  Decide quick!  They're coming.\n\nThere are very few right or wrong answers.  It's all about what trade-off you're willing to make to last one more day on the Death Road.\n\n* Road events.  That's right!  The \"road trip\" part of the description isn't a joke.  You don't spend ALL of your time hacking through armies of undead.  Plenty of time is spent on the road, cruising between hotspots.  Look for supplies, avoid bandits, meet traders, get in arguments in the car.  Like in any road trip, you never quite know what the next bend in the highway will bring, and again these events lead to more choices.  Fight the bandits and risk injury, or give up some food?  Waste gas driving around an obstacle or plow the car right through it and see what happens?  No right or wrong, just \"I hope this works!\"\n\n* RPG elements - Light and Tight!  With characters dying left and right, a complex stat system would be inappropriate here, but what there is is meaningful and involving.  Stats, skills, and unique character traits have direct impact on both the action gameplay and event resolution.  A strong character can swing heavier weapons without getting tired or win a \"pose-off\" when meeting apocalyptic body-builders.  A character with a good Medical skill will automatically heal wounds without wasting supplies.  A paranoid character will have special options to anticipate trouble but reduced morale, making it hard to keep them going on the Death Road.  And of course a character with the \"Irritating\" trait will have dialogue choices available to make any bad situation worse.\n\nThere are no numbers on these stats, just a color coded system to ballpark your abilities at a glance ... without ever knowing for sure exactly what they mean.  There is no \"levelling up\"; instead, stats can be improved through use during events, or crippled through bad decisions.  Build up your team directly through gameplay, not by optimizing number stacks on a spreadsheet.\n\n* Comedy!  You'll either love it or you won't.  If driving an ice cream truck through a horde of zombies, fighting alongside the real Santa Claus, \"pumping up\" until you're \"too swole to control\", renting out a witch's black cat, or arguing about who farted in the car doesn't tickle you, this may not be your game.  I love it all.  The tone never disappoints and is consistent throughout, weirdly giving the setting a solid, well-established feel despite its \"anything goes\" ethos.\n\nSo buy this game, good luck on the Death Road, and if you're thinking of downvoting my review you better COOL IT.", "timestamp_created": 1491539996, "timestamp_updated": 1491784238, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 29, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.780579", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30987526": {"recommendationid": "30987526", "author": {"steamid": "76561198144361577", "num_games_owned": 86, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 11442, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 770, "last_played": 1514055863}, "language": "english", "review": "I really enjoy this game and can't wait for more and more content.

Buy only, and I mean [b]ONLY[/b] if you are okay with RNG heavily impacting your experience. it's a pretty fun game full of some hilarious scenarios. Certainly fun but not for everyone, as it can lead to frusteration and annoyance easily.\n\n-/+ I'd say it's 75% luck and 25% skill. You shouldn't go into this game expecting to have control over your experience. Some people have over 30 hours on this game and haven't beat it once while others have less than 4 and have beat it multiple times. No matter how much \"skill\" you claim to have, it doesn't matter. This game is hit or miss in terms of winning. You get a lucky run or you don't.\n\n- The AI is fairly stupid, as they will constantly get themselves killed by doing stupid things (one of my followers got us killed by shooting a propane tank point-blank.) They will repeatedly get themselves trapped and die in easily avoidable situations. I found it less maddening to start the game without a companion, but sometimes the game forces you with one anyways. Even though companions drain your resources and drive you insane, there is no way to force them to leave your party unless they die during missions or become replaced.\n\n+ The characters and situations you get into on this game are quite funny. My party has had more harm done to them by insects than actual zombies. I was attacked by bees and ants many times. I'd also like to note that I've run into a witch, an anime girl that became so overcome by her own kawaii nature that she imploded into a disgusting monster that was barely recognizable as the little girl she once was. I found myself laughing at a lot that this game had to offer.\n\n+ Gameplay during missions is fun and simple. There are load of weapons to use, from simple branches to flamethrowers, that are quite satisfying to use against the undead hordes. There is also a great variety of situation types, such as siphoning gas from junkyards or saving a dog from a zombie-ridden apartment. Quite fun.\n\nIt's not perfect, and it certainly is not for everyone, but it is worth a try for those who are fans of these types of games. I personally don't like it too much, but I can see why some people would.

best games I have found on Steam, especially for the price. Anyone who says otherwise is a d*ngus and will be made to open a box with poop on the lid. Or thrown out of a car in favour of the next dog that comes along. Believe me, I'll do it. \n\nThe only way I can describe Death Road To Canada is 'an arcade-aesthetic, rogue-like, zombocalypse, choose-your-own-adventure, resource management, scrolling beat-'em-up' which I think pretty much covers everything. But damn, if it isn't so much more than the sum of its parts. \n\nI'm going to address one of the main quibbles about the game I've seen in other reviews: the difficulty. Some people have said it's too hard or that it's designed for co-op. Well, I won't deny it's a challenge, but for me, that can only be a good thing. I play with myself most of the time (stop giggling at the back!) and while there are certainly random elements that can scupper your plans, strategy and resource/item management do play a big role. \n(Hint: mechanics. They're the best). \nIt never gets too frustrating, either, since each game session is not overly long. But that doesn't mean there isn't a lot to see - over a week of playing DRTC and I'm still seeing new encounters and meeting characters I've never met before. \n\nOverall, it's a very polished game with a sometimes-quirky, sometimes-childish sense of humour that you can't help but love all the more for it. If I had to make any complaints, I would say it would be nice if you could custom-create a cat or dog character.\nA few more custom options for the humans would be nice as well, if that's your thing. \nBut cats and dogs are people, too.", "timestamp_created": 1491005171, "timestamp_updated": 1491005171, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30862363": {"recommendationid": "30862363", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043663812", "num_games_owned": 91, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 312, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496538389}, "language": "english", "review": "Can confirm.

It will feel similar to other games such as FTL where you manage your resources and you move from one random 'instance' to another. If you're to make it to Canada at all it will primarily be down to luck and it is very difficult. For instance, the sieges rely heavily on you having spare ammunition as often you won't have the room to manouver around the horde, meaning you really just have to blast them away before you get eaten. If you have to rely on melee, you will soon be too tired to swing your weapon and it'll all be over soon enough. That said, I don't think any of these are bad things, if anything it's somewhat realistic.\n\nThe locations and characters are all well drawn, interesting and genuinely upsetting to see eaten alive (especially the dog) and by the end of the play you'll feel like you've been through hell with them.\n\nThe sounds are great although the music is a little too upbeat to ever give the game a truly grim or scary atmosphere. I guess it wouldn't really fit the asthetic of the game anyway if it tried to be anything other than funny.\n\nMy only gripe would be that the characters get tired too quickly in combat. You often find yourself in situations where you need to run around in circles to avoid combat because you can't swing your weapon anymore. I don't know if the game would be any better without this mecahnic though, possibly losing too much difficulty if it was removed.\n\nAll in all it's a great game for those that like Roguelikes.

\n\nThe game is incredibly addicting, after 15 hours of playing, I'm still actively playing it.  It doesn't have a crazy amount of content, but it's all randomly generated, so it's a different each time, and it doesn't get repetitive.\n\nI really enjoy playing it with a friend, it has easy drop in multiplayer, so I plug in two PS4 controllers and we both have a blast! I've played an equal amount of single player, and it's still amazing, and it's easier to strategize, but it's a great time making decisions, looting and killing zombies together. So I'd say it's worth it to just play single player, but keep in mind that the 2 player is great.\n\nThe combat is very simple, but very enjoyable, and the character creation is surprisingly deep. It has hilarious events that happen, and the game doesn't take itself to seriously, which works well here. I really like this game, you should buy it, worth the price.\n\nNow I said I like the game, but there are a lot of things I want added, here's what they are.\n- 4 player local multiplayer needs to happen.\n- more perks and traits, and maybe add some more character customization as well.\n- pre made characters with unique looks, perk, traits, etc. \n- new game+, where you continue with all your characters and equipment, as you travel somewhere else.\n\nAs of right now, I would give the game 8/10, it would easily become a 9/10 if they continue to update (which they have done so far)", "timestamp_created": 1490842372, "timestamp_updated": 1490842372, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30823647": {"recommendationid": "30823647", "author": {"steamid": "76561198104144810", "num_games_owned": 1217, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 658, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499559782}, "language": "english", "review": "Believe the reviews, this was the best purchase ive made in a long time... you gotta co-op this, most fun and lughs ive ever had in local co-op action.

reading the reviews, I just had to get this game. I'm not sure what all the complaining about how hard this game is. Ok so you can die easily through no fault of your own with just some decision making but I managed to make it to Canada on my third try and made it in to beat the normal mode. The first two attempts I died horrbile deaths but it was a learning experience. Then the third time came around and I was thinking I was going to die again but after meeting Jason...I mean \"Mason\" on the side of the road holding his machette and chainsaw, the tide of the game turned in my favour.

No matter how seriously OP I twink my characters, no matter what strategy I take, this entire game can beat you on a bad coin flip. Even if you manage to RNG your way to the final stretch, the game will almost always end with two consecutive Sieges, the first typically in somewhere claustrophobic and the actual final wave I've only ever gotten to ONE TIME, (throughout about 20 playthroughs) so I couldn't tell you one way or the other.\n \nI've read a few threads and basically everyone I see is under the consensus that this game is unfairly hard and genuinely not fun after the first several playthroughs. The only reason I'm not going to get a steam refund is because I've seen a few news feeds hinting at a better build of the game and several Dev posts saying that they're tweaking/introducing a legacy system where your death doesn't mean you've totally lost everything.\n\nThis game just really makes me mad, it's a very fun and always an entertaining co-op experience, but when you want to just chill and have an easy run, there's really nothing you can do. This is on-par with Don't Starve in that death is a serious thing, but at least Don't Starve had some ways of giving you a cushion to land on when you inevitably did die, and made you give more of a shit about your character. I spent most of my games distributing stat bonuses/level ups/etc amongst my whole crew but then ALL OF THEM DIED ON THE FINAL WAVE and made me feel like it sincerely did not matter what I did during the entire game leading up to that point. I just needed a lucky dice roll or something completely arbitrary and out of my control. \n\nDon't get me wrong, it's a wonderful game and taken at what it was marketed as, it's extremely true-to-form. There were plenty of times when I died in Oregon Trail from bad RNG or some dumbass mistake, plenty of times I died in Don't Starve thanks to my poor reaction time or underestimating an enemy, and I really don't think I'm a bad gamer or have a weak disposition for real-time combat, I just can't take that helpless feeling I get when my crew gets shredded by ONE SINGLE SIEGE after literally hours of beating zombie ass like a rented mule.\n\nIf you plan on getting this game, buy it during Halloween when it's on sale, I paid around $10 for it and I feel like that may have been a LITTLE too much, but for the content, I thought it was fair. It's retail price is absurd for what basically ammounts to a novelty game that you'll never get to play casually.\n\nTL:DR - Don't expect to beat it, but it's a great arcade game.", "timestamp_created": 1490468476, "timestamp_updated": 1490468476, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497512", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30733316": {"recommendationid": "30733316", "author": {"steamid": "76561198125420415", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1462, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 8, "last_played": 1513561767}, "language": "english", "review": "TRY TO GET A NINTENDO SWITCH PORT.

I need so much more time to take it all in.\nDeath Road to Canada is a fantastic take on the Oregon Trail that blends humor, survival, character customization, RPG elemnets, beat-em-up combat, and parodies of pop culture that make you crack a grin.\nThe soundtrack isn't that diverse, but it's enough to keep you bopping your head to the beat and humming along as you (attempt to) rip your way through hordes of zombies. The sound effects really match the feeling of whats happening. I really love the use of sound in this game. It's satisfying.\nThe gameplay is simple yet complex. Managing supplies, your vehicle, your party of friends, weapons, and descisions that really do take efect. It successfully blends in these RPG elements that makes the game flow smoothly.\nCombat is simple. Hit zombies with your weapons. Thats it. Smack them till' they dead. Mm-mm. Delicious.\nThe best part of the game, without a doubt, is the Familiar Characters Mode. You can create your friends, family, celebrities, Youtubers, et cetera. The possibilities are endless. you can give them perks to help your party on your journey, and personality traits that can boost those perks. This really makes the game feel like your own, and you really do feel terrible when they get killed in the field. \nThe graphics are pixelated, and thats fine with me. It gives the game potential to age well and stretch out to a more appealing audience. This game is only pretty mild, being a zombie game. They drop a few guts and...black stuff, but it's never that bad. No blood, just...oil, I guess. \nThe game is local co-op compatible, but sadly has no online co-op support by the time this review is released. It's a bit of a bummer, but it's pretty enjoyable with friends, and great to play by yourself.\nDeath Road to Canada successfully blends survival, humor, RPG elements, beat-em-up combat, and charming pixel graphics that appeal very well. The game is priced extremely well at 15 bucks, but I bought it on sale at 10 bucks. Not that... thats important or, whatever.\nAlso its uh... kinda glithcy. Like, the game will stop or glitch like, once every six to twelve playthroughs.\nAlso its uh... kinda glitchy. Like, the game will crash or freeze or glitch at least once every ten to twelve playthroughs. And playthroughs dont last that long. I mean, The game deleted all my save data, like custom characters. it took me a long time to make my friends! And it did it again the day after. WHAT.\n\n8-Great\n+Charming Graphics\n+Well executed RPG elements\n+Successful Survival gameplay\n+Smooth Beat-Em-Up Combat\n+Funny\n+Brilliant Character Customization\n+Interesting Mechanics\n+Choices, Choices, CHOICES!!!!\n+Entertaining Soundtrack\n+Lots of Game Modes\n+Pop Culture References\n\n\n\n-Extremely Glitchy\n\nDeath Road to Canada is an entertaining game that blends multiple game elements very well. It's addictive and gives you that sense of \"Just Five more Minutes\".

If it were to be easy, it would get boring pretty quickly. The RNG may be a bit tough at times, but it merely poses as a fun challenge.\n\nThis game can act as a really nice outlet to pass an hour or two of boredom, whether it be alone or with a friend; its humorous antics would surely entertain you throughout the playthrough. I recommend this game to people who have a bit of time to spend learing over and over again of the game mechanics, and for those who love RNG, co-op, humor, and management games.

Essentially, it is \u201cOregon Trail\u201d but with zombies. The game forces you to make some very hard decisions which generally lead to table-flippingly bad outcomes. There are some other less consequential ones as well. These decisions generally are what decides if you make it to Canada or not. Shooting/Stabbing/Running skills are not what decides how good you are at the game, but some of such skills are necessary to avoid receiving too much damage. If you are looking for a survival game that is based off and challenges your finger agility, this is the wrong game for you. If you want a funny survival game that is based off and challenges your decision-making skills, this is the right game for you. \n\n\tI just beat the standard campaign and was very thrilled with the ending. To get there, you need to be very careful when evading zombies, especially at the end of the game, but this does not take too much skill. The AI's are not as good at the art of dodging and will likely die due to getting trapped. Because of this, play as your most valuable character and treat your \u201cbuddies\u201d as zombie bait and extra lives. Food can be sometimes scarce and is very useful for trading for supplies at the end of the game, so limit the amount of group members. I like to have two people in my group, but I will add a third if he/she/(enter gender here) has good traits. \n\n\tP.S. : If you really like your \u201cOtaku Katana\u201d don't use it because it will likely break on the first day.\n\n\n\nr a n d o m t e x t f o r f o r m a t i n g ***   U P D A T E   *** r a n d o m t e x t f o r f o r m a t i n g\n\n\n\nI have beaten the standard game 4 times now. I have also beaten short trip to heck, rare characters mode, and friendly faces mode. I have memorized the outcomes of most events. I still hold my previous statements. Mostly. There is more to the game than just your decisions in game created senarios, your decisions on which weapons to use, when, and with   w  h  o  m   also greatly effect your chances of making it to Canada.\n\n\nI have also found some \"bugs\" in the game. Note: These are minor and will not effect the gameplay  t o o  much:\n\n\n1. You cannot kick your teammates out of the group: Sometimes trash people enter your group when you are low of food. It is irritating that there is no clear way to kill (or kick them from the group) them without risking any harm to your teammates; the only way is to send them in solo to die. (If you have other teammates present they will stick to the person you are trying to sacrifice and often die). This is very irritating to me and I would like a way to kick out members of the group, even with some possible negative results not already in the game.\n\n\n2. Teammates will often attempt to run through a horde rather than around it: Your team always stays close behind you (they rarely even collect loot (heckin freeloaders)). This means when you see an opening in a horde for a split second, your team will rush in behind you after the opening has closed. Conclusion: AI needs to be more autonomous\n\n\n3. Weird ammo glitch: I have noticed when I bring (lets say 10 shotgun ammo) with me and when I come back to the car after looting and not collecting any ammo, it will say that I collected 10 shotgun ammo. If I use 3 ammo, it will say that I collected 7 more shotgun ammo rather than the -3.

One example of this is a goat that you can try to milk or recruit, but both options often lead to the death of a party member and the goat will wander off after recruiting it.

Thankfully this game is very simple, not only in graphics but also in gameplay! Most of the gameplay you have is looting buildings while fending off zombies which is pretty well done. Zombies are slow but come in bulks, they aren't dangerous on their own but can corner you really easily, so don't let that happen! Once you're cornered by all the zombies you haven't killed upon your entry you shall see the errors of your ways, as rushing through a crowd of zombies is not impossible but very unlikely to survive if the horde is packed tightly enough.\nThe humor of this game is something you should experience for yourself, as there is plenty to be found! \n\nNow, the one glaring issue this game has though, in my opinion, is 1 particular map that can come up in a \"Siege\" event... A single, narrow street with 3 dead ends. To make it clear, a siege means that a horde of zombies will continously pour in from the edges of the map, you can't kill all of those zombies and have to put up a good mix of kiting them and dispatching of the ones that block your way. That is nearly impossible on that 1 particular map, as your kiting potential is next to none when all you can do is go left or right (or get stuck in a dead end!)

These problems are almost always based on a stat roll, where someone's stats may affect the outcome. Failed rolls may lowered stats, loss of supplies, car damage, or injury or death of characters in the group. Successful rolls will do the opposite, increase stats or gain supplies, but can also just be better than the failed rolls, such as getting out of a burning building unhurt, or charming bandits into taking less food from your group.\nNow I shall ramble about these stats. There are ten different stats that affect the game. 3 combat stats, 4 personality stats, 2 support stats, and morale. Combat stats consist of strength, fitness, and shooting. These usually help most with gathering supplies but are also in a few stat rolls. Personality stats consist of wits, attitude, composure, and loyalty. These stats only help in stat rolls but they rarely change. Support stats consist of medical and mechanical and while both help in roll checks, they also support the group. Medical allows you to heal teammates and mechanical allows you to repair your car and trust me when I say not having a car is REALLY bad. Morale definately changes the most out of any other stat and is the most common reward or consequence. Low morale will get teammates leaving the group or complaining that someone is pulling the group down. However, these stats are usually kept secret, and thus it's hard to know how the character would do in stat checks.\nHere are some Pros and Cons.\n\nPROS:\n- Addicting.\n- Funny.\n- Custom characters and perks and traits work incredibly well. Great for making friends and family. Characters are fun to make, fun to roleplay, and fun to see in game. Satisfying when perks and traits match well with the person.\n- Simple yet very nice pixel graphics.\n- Many, MANY different weapons.\n- Different, harder difficulties for players who had beaten normal modes.\n- Dogs.\n- Cats.\n- Goats.\n- I haven't actually played rare characters mode (I'm in love with familiar), but I've seen some of the characters and they have interesting mechanics that differentiate from normal characters and are REALLY funny ideas.\n- A zombie apocalypse that is funny and makes you feel awesome as oppose to some other zombie games that are darker and depressing, and a depressing zombie world isn't all that bad but the approach this game takes is happier and unique.\n- Setting AIs from Run, Defend or Fight is so good and so useful. Also, you can make it so that they use melee only, shooting only, or switch between.\n- Supply gathering never seems repetitive\n- A lot of replayability.\n- Unknown stats lead to tough decisions.\n- Really stressful... but in a good way.\n- Stats allow for specialization, which is very satisfying, especially in familiar characters mode.\n- I swear to you that the first time you play this game, you will NOT win. But as you work hard, practice over and over again, it may take 5, 10, or 50 games, but one day, you will complete it. You will beat the mode, and that was my most satisfying moment in this game.\n\nCONS\n- You need to beat Deadlier Road mode before you can play Rare EXTREME or Familiar EXTREME.\n- Can't make custom dogs or cats.\n- AI can be obnoxious and unresourceful, such as wasting ammo and trying to decide between two weapons that are exactly the same. And while I like that they don't use grenades anymore, they now take no weapon over a weak weapon, which can also be annoying.\n- The second last battle is super hard and really intense but the final battle is so much easier that the excitement dies down.\n\nHowever, the pros outweigh the cons here, so I'm giving this game a thumbs up.\nOh, and by the way, I haven't even played multiplayer yet.", "timestamp_created": 1486417654, "timestamp_updated": 1486417654, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519644", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29747471": {"recommendationid": "29747471", "author": {"steamid": "76561198131304005", "num_games_owned": 67, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 234, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486408656}, "language": "english", "review": "this game is hard af and it tries to kill you in every situation, sometimes it becomes annoying as fuck but its fun as hell totally worth it!", "timestamp_created": 1486408732, "timestamp_updated": 1486408732, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.482219", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29741828": {"recommendationid": "29741828", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072110317", "num_games_owned": 119, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 823, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486765939}, "language": "english", "review": "A hidden gem, it's a really fun game which I didn't know existed.\nFound it by accident and had a blast playing it.", "timestamp_created": 1486390399, "timestamp_updated": 1487243896, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541312", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29741564": {"recommendationid": "29741564", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989274778", "num_games_owned": 52, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1719, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487298073}, "language": "english", "review": "Love this game.

There are SO many zombie games these days, and tv shows for that matter, that they aren't done with any real sense of quality.  Deathroad to Canada is a completely different beast.  Yes it has zombies and for some it may be the focus of the game.  For me it's not.  I can honestly say I haven't felt this refreshed with a zombie esque type game in a very long time, the last was Zombie Estate 1 and 2 for Xbox 360 from the indie dev selection.  When I initially heard about this game I had reservations.  Only upon watching people play, like Vinesauce who ironically solidified my decision to buy this gem, did I realise this game was far better than it seems at times.  The genuine tongue and cheek humor adds flavor to moments when you are stuck in a room with 30+ zombies pining after you like some schoolgirl over her boy band crush.  As of writing this I have YET to actually beat the game.  This doesn't frustrate me or anything because each time I get close, I am sent into erratic displays of giddy laughter.

I really like death road to Canada and its RPG style gameplay. First, I\u2019ll talk the basics about the game and the story that I know so far and after that I\u2019ll talk about some special mechanics for this game specifically. Now let\u2019s get started with the story. The story is that it\u2019s the zombie-apocalypse and there\u2019s rumors that in Canada there\u2019s no zombies so you plan to get to Canada in a car and \u2026 that\u2019s it. Now for the basic mechanics; there are choices you must make: gather, train, survive and die (a lot).\nLet me explain. First you must get supplies which is food medical and different type of ammo. Secondly, there are different stats that that can change everything and you can upgrade them by making choices. Third, the combat is really simple plus if you go close to a zombie you don\u2019t immediately take damage. And lastly you\u2019re dead, you\u2019re dead, you\u2019re really really dead.\nAnd now for some special features; 1 there\u2019s local multiplayer, 2 the different modes. All and all a 9/10.

It's great for quick breaks between other games, it's great for dedicated game sessions, it's just great. Combat is simple but satisfying - push button to swing weapon, push button to swap weapons, use arrow keys to move - and the way zombies work in this game mean you can easily beat a couple of them, but a hoard is terrifying - as it should be!\n\nThe game is about taking a team of losers to Canada while driving up the East Coast of the US - unlike reality, it's easy to cross the border - the main trouble is getting there, as America's filled with vile zombies. You have to scavenge food and supplies and keep your car loaded while keeping your team alive, and it's not an easy task.\n\nThe primary obstacle for you will be your team: they're very good at being idiots. A simple fart in the car will drive them apart until someone breaks down and leaves, they can get into deadly pose-offs with muscular men, they can for some reason pick up the worst hitchhikers you've ever met. They also eat too much food!\n\n...But they're your losers. Literally! You can make custom characters, so if you want to bring Megatron and Starscream on a roadtrip to Canada together, my god you can do it. No, they won't be robots, but Megatron can flip out in righteous fury and punch your friends, so it's as accurate as you're gonna get.\n\nSo, let's see: graphics, check. They're clear and easy to read, and gorgeous to boot. Music? Addicting with enough variety that I'm happy to keep listening to it. Controls? Very tidy, and you can remap them! Gameplay? Excellent.\n\nSo how about that Early Access status? The game as-is is complete: you can play a game on normal mode and run into plenty of variety, enemies, characters, etc - without feeling like it's incomplete. There's no glaringly missing features, and I've only encountered one or two mild bugs in my playtime (while playing in the Beta branch, so those are being worked on).

Me and my group fell dead in an instant, and it was all my fault. \n\n     It started with just me and my brother. We were driving along, with about as much supplies as one would want at the start of their journey. Enough to instill hope for the long and arduous journey ahead. That is until I committed the most horrid Iniquity known to the modern man. \n\n     I farted\n\n     I looked to my brother and I saw hatred in his eyes. In a panic I did what any strong man within a life or death situation would do. I blamed the other. Reluctantly, my brother accepted it without argument. We both knew I was the culprit, but we were close enough that such a large fault could be overlooked. However, it did put a deal of strain on our relationship. \n\n     We traveled further, fighting against the zombie horde. Until I came across my girlfriend, trying in vain to push open a door clearly labeled \"pull\". Me and my brother's morale had been beaten down, we were in dire need of an ally to help push back against the coming darkness. For a moment I contemplated leaving her behind. Her low level of intelligence could prove to be our downfall But, I glanced down to the small stuffed penguin she had given me as a gift. I still kept it around, she always knew I was fond of penguins and risked her life to scavenge one after all the shops had been raided. It seemed strange that people would leave behind such a valuable item in a zombie infested wasteland. It seemed to beg me to take her with us. So we welcomed her to the group and continued on our way to Canada. \n\n     Days went by with much success. With her help we had been able to scrounge up enough resources to last us a while. Everything seemed to be looking for us. That was of course, until yet again someone broke wind. For a brief moment we all eyed each other. The friendship and loyalty I once saw gave way to anger and suspicion. Not once, but twice someone had broken the sacred oath to keep that which was meant for the bathroom, in the bathroom. I was not responsible this time, but that would not stop the group from blaming me. Pinning the blame on another would not work this time. Then, a glimmer of hope appeared, I could have my girlfriend attempt to \"deduce\" who had farted. I never thought she was particularly stupid, but if I was correct, I could line up the \"evidence\" to ensure the blame did not fall on me. I could avoid becoming more broken without sacrificing what precious little relationships I had left. I did as planned, and my girlfriend figured out who farted.\n\n     Me.\n\n     Then I saw something in her eyes. Glee. SHE had been the one who farted. It was HER fault. But I could not argue with her. I had underestimated her, I fell for her trap, and had allowed her to avoid the blame without risk, However, my brother was convinced and the matter was settled. Had she feigned idiocy this entire time? How much of her word could I trust now that I knew she was so willing to blame others for her own farts? I looked down to my sentimental stuffed penguin. How could I trust that this penguin was even a quality store product? It must have been shameful replica designed for the sole purpose of earning my trust. Yes, I could see it now. The eyes were slightly discolored and the head was tilted at an angle. It was a lie.\n\n     How long had she been maintaining this facade? Was my brother deceiving me as well? I would not let this stand. I planned to escape the hordes of zombies with the supplies and leave the others to suffer. One could blame another for one's farts, but if one gives another a stuffed penguin that is anything below store quality THAT was inexcusable. Unfortunately, in planning to escape the future horde along with abandoning my group. I inadvertently landed me into a horde that was right in front of us. You\u2019d think a large mass of writhing undead would be hard to miss, but alas my wrath had blinded me.\n\n     There was no mercy in that shambling wood cabin. The undead beat down the roof and walls. They broke in from every part that they could. We fought as hard as we could. My girlfriend was the first to fall, then my brother. Both became nothing more than a mass of broken flesh beneath a horde of savage creatures. Finally, as I fell to the hordes around me, as they feasted on my flesh, two simple words left my mouth before those creatures tore my body apart.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDang it", "timestamp_created": 1484620410, "timestamp_updated": 1484774889, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29299085": {"recommendationid": "29299085", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005396567", "num_games_owned": 238, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2697, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486234947}, "language": "english", "review": "crack", "timestamp_created": 1484585044, "timestamp_updated": 1484585044, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29295342": {"recommendationid": "29295342", "author": {"steamid": "76561198289144428", "num_games_owned": 15, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1925, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513117259}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing game, hilarious and fun to play, but I only have one complaint.

Hard because of how one second you have a full team where everyone is super good, but then when you get to a trader camp, have no food left, so then you steal some food from a trader, and then the whole camp kills everyone except your weak healer ;-;. Enjoyable because you could come a cross a very free horse man..... who cant wield any wepons so when your whole team dies excpet for him you basically are dead, which goes back to the hard thing XD. but there is a lot of replayability because of how everyone you meat on the road has random stats. There was this one time when i had a dog (o btw the dogs can talk and carry wepons XD) and she found a empty mascot suit that came to life and yelled \"I HATE MONDAYS!\", so then we did anything that a normal human would do, we recruted him to our group. But then things went wrong, one day while we were driving the suit just yell \"I HATE MONDAYS!\" and then he said \"AND TODAY IS A MONDAY\". then he teleported us all into a seige in a random set of woods and 2 of my people died, including my dog ;-;(just kidding it deserved it she was a jerk >:( ). so ya that is how i lost that game. But back to the actual review even with all of this fun stuff that i just talked about there are some cons one being the multiplayer, the second player has to each and everytime you go somewhere select the charrecter they want to play and join the fight which is realy tedious. Secondly the second player cannot go through doors which means, the first player has the infamous main charrecter deseas (but to a lower extent because they can die and the story goes on), this makes going through a house really annoying because the first player has to do everything. All in all this is a great game and i recomend it.

The genre is congested with stale, uninspired, boring and pointlessly challenging games that make this over saturated part of the market even more and more irrelevant.  But this game, with its goofy atmosphere, upbeat music  and charming art style, is breathing new life into this undead genre.\nDeath Road to Canada is an easy game to pick up, an easy one to learn, but even harder to put down. The rogue-like adventure/survival aspects make every play through of this game different and interesting. And with the custom character feature, you are given the power to generate so many more possibilities as you experiment to see who works well with whom.\nPart of the reason this game is so easy to fall in love with is the culmination of its dorky sense of humor and catchy OST. For some unforeseeable reason, the chiptune music pairs perfectly with a game about blood, guts and survival. And the possibly fatal decisions you are making on the road turn from frustrating to hilarious due to the comical writing. Never before has a fart been the catalyst that led to my character's downfall, and for that reason alone this game deserves an award. \nI have but two complaints. First is that the RNG can sometimes ruin you. Often you are left with decisions while driving; do you surrender food or fight the bandits? Abandon the car or attempt to fix it? etc, etc. But at times you come to a decision where the solution involves shooting or other skills, and by some cruel twist of fate the character making this decision is the least proficient marksman. And you can't change that. This has never ruined the experience for me, mind you. With these decisions, the game is often fair. All of my failures are my own, not the game's. Save one instance, this is also my second complaint. For some reason, when the AI characters encounter a weapon they already have they get stuck in a perpetual loop of weapon switching. This doesn't happen too often, but when traveling the mall I had two characters of mine get stuck in this loop with umbrellas which resulted in their deaths. This led to a slippery slope which ended in a game over. So beware of that.\nUltimately this game is more than worth your time and money. It's fair yet challenging. It's more fun than frustrating. And it's highly addictive. Give it a chance, especially if you love other rogue games like Binding of Isaac and things of that ilk. I'd also like to recommend checking out more of Rocketcat's games. I enjoy playing their mobile games, and I look forward to see what these devs will do in the future.\nTL;DR\nGood game. Happy chiptune music. Dog's use crowbars. Farts can be fatal. This game is rife with references to different shows/games/etc. Cat video magazines are a thing in this game and I'm sad that they aren't real.\n", "timestamp_created": 1483146492, "timestamp_updated": 1483146492, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28850329": {"recommendationid": "28850329", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064817350", "num_games_owned": 177, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1486, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3, "last_played": 1513373518}, "language": "english", "review": "Like Organ Trail but you get to play more of a role in surviving.", "timestamp_created": 1483145420, "timestamp_updated": 1483145420, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.582365", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28836217": {"recommendationid": "28836217", "author": {"steamid": "76561198152997133", "num_games_owned": 68, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 3884, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507772154}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a game I highly recommend for those that like Oregan Trail type games. You start in Florida, a state in the United States very far down south. You and a buddy will travel to Canada to escape the zombies. The game is all about trust. If you feel that someone will screw you over, do something about it. The game gets more fun, though, when played in familier characters mode. The characters you create come to join you on your adventure! Sure, you can only have a max party of 4, but plenty of deaths may happen by stupid desition making. If the game is a bit too easy, after beating the normal campagin, new, harder modes are added in, the best probably being the harder familier characters mode. But with a real life friend by your side, you can make it a bit easier (or harder) in co-op mode. As long as 2 people are on the field fighting, a buddy can join in to help you in your fight against the zombie hoard! I recomend you try this one out, or look it up. A good 2 player short playthrough to watch is on the PBGGameplay account on YouTube. Its where I first got into the game.\nEDIT: Looking through the negative reviews for tis game, I only needed to sit down for 5 minutes to see why some hate the game. Its all RNG. To that I say, that is what an Oregon Trail like game is supposed to be. In a zombie outbreak, those odds will be stacked against you. The only problems I find is that the AI sucks so bad you are better off playing Co-op.

A charming person can sometimes get stuff for free at trader camps. There are also rare characters that have unique personalities, stats, abilities, and their own unique events.

I love the music and it's so happy and really brings out the emotion within this game, there is only a couple sad/intense songs which might drive certain people away from this game. Also to go along with the music is the pixel aesthetic. However, the pixel theme makes the characters very simple and their features become hard to distinguish. But the thing the game does beautifully with the art is backgrounds, the color and motion the scenery provides is nice to look at and really adds to the atmosphere.\n\nGame play:\nThere's two sections of game play within Death Road to Canada: the action section and the Oregon Trail RNG Strategy DND Skill Checkin' Character Deathin' Road to the Maple Syrupy Hockey Land of Stereotypes Eh? section. The action phase consists of you and your party picking up whatever weaponry is lying around and bashing the brains out of some un-dead walking corpses, there is no special abilities or attacks but there is a stamina function. This stamina function limits you in a good way, because you can't swing(but you can shoot) wildly, forcing you to be smart about your attacks, also factored by the size of the hoard, and the location of the horde. During these action phases, you will be doing one of two things: looting or defending. Always Be Looting, your source of resources defined by your choice of location to go find the good stuff in. Then there is siege. I hate siege. A siege is where you are confined to a small area of map for an extended period of time left with whatever you find and what you have on you to fend against increasingly large hoards of zombabos- some of these are really, REALLY, difficult if you don't have a reasonable supply of bullets and guns.\n\nOn to the RNG aspect portion of the game. Your typical food and gas and such, but there is also a great system of morale. Morale is simple, it's how happy your party members are. Good morale will keep things running while bad morale will lead to run ending situations- keep your morale high by having enough supplies. I think the morale system is fair and not overly imposing so it adds a fun layer to the car ride to Canada. Along the road you will have to make several choices, and what may seem like the correct answer is not always the right answer. There are a lot of hard decisions that are designed to screw you over- unless you have a person with enough skill to get you out of that sticky situation. There are an assortment of skills and they each do different things, some carry over into the action portions while the others exist purely for the car portions- you will want to keep these up as they will get you out of ALOT of bad times. Other than that everything else is pretty cookie-cutter.\n\nNow most of this game is great, but one thing this game does not do well is UI. The UI is very interrupting, as the only way to switch your party leader is via the pause menu in-game, which really takes away from that intense horde fight going on. Also ammo splitting is the most needed thing in the UI but it's not fully there, as in there is not a specific way to do this, and the current system is confusing. The UI looks nice enough but the functionality needs to be a lot better- there's no direct switching of items from party member to party member in the pre-mission gear assignment screen.\nHopefully this will get implemented however.\n\nOverall if you are into rougelikes, this game is great for beginners and experienced fans of the genre looking for a greater challenge- some of the modes are ball-bustingly hard for all you masochists out there. Give it a shot and I'm sure you will love this game.", "timestamp_created": 1482345150, "timestamp_updated": 1482345272, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499588", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28499347": {"recommendationid": "28499347", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054558206", "num_games_owned": 114, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 6023, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512385218}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is a really fun pixelated permadeath game.

This game, without a doupt, has that \"One more go and I'll stop but you keep playing\" hold on you. The combat reminds me of Dark Souls where you must pace yourself. The music is catchy and will put you in a good mood no matter how bad your day IRL was. The comedic outcomes of events are fantastic, showing that this whole journey is for the fun then for the zombie drama. The characters will always make you laugh with the stupid stuff they get into, even in death. It's just wonderful.\n\n     The game has a few flaws but nothing a patch won't fix like AI characters geting stuck juggling duplicate weapons on the ground, items on Y'all Mart shelfs not being clearly visiable for picking up, not knowing what day it is (looking at you Monday) and not being able to \"Always Be Looting\" whenever you wish.

(i.e Found Lank in Rare Mode, Lank is playable in all Rare Mode Options.) The current selection of Rare Characters is hillarious but we need more; like Doomguy, Issac, Mayro, Sanic, Puc-Man, The L4D and Dead Island Survivors, the Protect-Me Knights/Gotta Protectors, Fazbear & Friends, Robbie Rotten, and more!\n\n[b]More Rare Rides[/b]\nJust more please. I could list so many; The Time Travaling DeLorean, Mad Max's Machine, Classic Ecto 1, The Bat Mobile, Santa's Sleigh, Cars from Wacky Racers, TF2 Sniper's Camper Van, The Flintstone's Car, Thomas the Tank Engine's Bertie Bus (Hell thrown in Thomas as well cause why not?), and more! \n\n[b]No Hitch-hikers Allowed Mode[/b]\nPick 1-4 characters and they will be the only ones you can play with.\n\n[b]USA Tour Mode[/b]\nTour ALL 50 States before reaching Canada.

Also, Saveable Stats, Choice of starting weapon, and an option for Rare Perks earned by Rare Characters (or least they bump a perk up to 4 stars).\n\n[b]More Animals[/b]\nI wanna see more crazy animals to team up with or even ride. Ask Jontron if his \"Robotic bird\" Jacques can be put in to shoot zombies with his lazor beam eyes.\n\n[b]More Zambies[/b]\nDon't take that too literal, I'm more refering to more looks and even \"Speical Infected\".

That said, this is a fantastic game that well exceeded my expectations for what it could become 3 years ago.\n\nDeath Road to Canada is essentially a mix of Organ Trail (and not Oregon Trail, though more on that in a bit) and Procedural Generation. The focus of the game has you essentially driving in a vehicle towards the border to Canada from Florida, building up your party (of jerks) abilities as well as gathering weapons and supplies as you proceed along the Death Road. A lot of the action for this game comes from when you stop the your vehicle to get out - scavenging for supplies, rescuing potentially new jerks to recruits, dealing with traders and bandits, and surviving zombie sieges.\n\nNow, I mentioned Organ trail (and by extension Oregon Trail). For those who don't know what those games are (because this game very much based on how they work) - this is essentially a vehicle traveling game where you make decisions as they randomly come up on your journey. As you drive along you'll decide what areas you will scavenge in from a list of choices or how you might deal with a bandit blockade that you come across. There are mini-action instances in Organ Trail and Oregon Trail where you hop out of your vehicle; similar to this game though here they make up the core of the game play.\n\nEssentially, where a lot of the play will be at in this game is walking around as a party gathering supplies, weapons, and new party members. You control one of the characters, and you can switch control  to any of the characters in your party that are in close proximity to the one you are controlling. The others will be AI controlled (or controlled by another player on Local Coop). Depending on the situation, there may be sparse few zombies or zombies raining from the ceiling and clawing their way up through the ground. Depending on the time of day the zombies may be more passive or more aggressive.\n\nProbably most notably is that decision making is really what this game is all about. Maybe you see a horde of zombies in front of you and you need to make the decision to take a detour or to drive right through them (damaging your car). Maybe while scavenging and there is one more building to raid, but it is nearing nighttime and you have injured party members along with whatever loot you have already found.\n\nI well recommend this game and consider it a generally good play - likely even better if you can play it in Local Coop.", "timestamp_created": 1481555702, "timestamp_updated": 1481590184, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28319686": {"recommendationid": "28319686", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060923274", "num_games_owned": 67, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 5606, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 22, "last_played": 1513879984}, "language": "english", "review": "After 42 hours of trying to get to canada i finally made it.

(oh that's been said before? well, it's still true) and I think I REALLY like it.\n\nI'll get the Cons & Pros out of the way, first.\n\n[h1]CONS:[/h1]\n[olist]\n[*]it's perma-death.\nmeaning you may get attached to awesome characters only to have him or her or EVERYONE die. :D\n\n[*]the RNG on text encounters. Sometimes the RNG will seem unfair & that's just how it is with these games. Make a choice that has a 50/50 chance of being good or terrible. Oh no. Lookit, a character died 'cause the game told me she/he did.\n\n[*]\"Doors and how they can kill you\" - how doors work is only 1st player (lead role) can go through doors to go to the next room. This would be fine, BUT if 2nd player isn't immediately next to you, a delay is put in before 2nd player appears at the next doorway. In theory it's good, but it quickly becomes frustrating when you realize \"Oh no. 2nd player was 2 steps behind me and now I just killed them.\" :S\n\n[*] NO ONLINE Multi-Player (I admit the game is very fun as couch co-op, but it still is worth mentioning)\n[/olist]\n[h1]NEUTRALS[/h1]\n[olist]\n[*]it's so good you'll almost always get that 'just one more time' feeling when & if you die.\n\n[*]family friendly -(could be a pro or a con) nothing inappropriate; NO cursing, excessive gore, or 'suggestive' talk\n[/olist]\n[h1]PROS: (too many to list, but I'll try) [/h1]\n[olist]\n[*]2 Player Co-Op! -drop-in/drop-out cooperative play at any time. (fun tip: 2nd Player can choose which party member to play as when dropping in on a playable encounter - ie: town, swarm event, etc.)\n\n[*]Cool character creator -sure, it may be retro pixelated graphic style, but there are enough customization options to generally make characters that look mostly like anyone you know.\n\n[*]64 character slots -save & use your own custom characters; can set as the 2 starting characters OR as possible recruits. \n\n[*]different modes -3 modes are unlocked from the start. more can be unlocked as you play the game and do certain things. Each mode has different rules for which characters you will meet. (note: play familiar mode if you want your team to meet ONLY custom characters)\n\n[*]great soundtrack (that reminds me of music from Metropolismania [PS2 game, released 2002] for some reason)\n\n[*]Fun for the whole family/audience -text narration, character dialogue, animations, references, & personalized characters come together in such a way that ...it's easier for spectators to engage & understand what's happening.\n\n[*]references (I won't spoil) to at least a few things from your childhood and/or 90's/early 2000s era.\n\n[*]RNG: never knowing what characters you're going to run into\n\n[*]SAVE AND QUIT! - the game doesn't make this feature super obvious, BUT if you quit the game, then the current game session will be saved at the point of the last town /playable encounter. Awesome, considering each game session varies in length\n\n[*]H I G H Replay Value. due to random encounters, random characters, and randomly generated levels -all varied enough to keep it interesting through dozens of hours of playthroughs (probably even more)\n\n[*]nuances of strategy: shut doors behind you, carry up to 3 weapons, choosing roles & weapons before each playable encounter...these are all things that did NOT need to be in the game, but their inclusion gives DRtC much more strategy and depth\n[/olist]\n\n[h1]CLOSING[/h1]\nI can't put into words how great this game is.

So much replayability!\n\nThis game is as addicting as it is similar to playing FTL but with zombies and decisions. You and your party have to escape to the borders of Canada since the USA is having a zombie apocalypse and oh boy, you will have a variety of choices and events in your journey since the destination is sort of like reaching Mt Everest or finding a lost treasure. In gameplay, you have to loot resources from places from food to gas, weapons, etc in order to survive the journey. But be careful, zombies in this game are numerous so you have to be hasty or cautious depending on what you're dealing with and have to battle your way in and out. You also have to plan ahead as your resources easily run out.\n\nPros:\n\n+ Replayability (You will get a lot of game overs if you're not prepared. The fact you have plenty of customization as well as events to help you succeed is why it's really enjoyable whenever I repeat the game. Wanna go Leeroy Jenkins? Get a BERSERK character. Rather play safe and smart? Paranoid characters are your brains.)\n\n+ Variety (Characters, weapons, events, cars, etc, I lost count how many events there are and some are even references to characters from games, movies, real life people, etc. I won't spoil who but it's a lot fun discovering the silly references the devs put in. The characters also have their own stats and traits so keep in mind on them. )\n\n+ Customization (You can customize characters that you wanna put in like naming them  because they'll appear in the game when you find them. The strong parts are the traits and perks you can put in which have their pros and cons. They can help you or betray you depending on the situation)\n\n+ Music (For a zombie apocalypse game, it sure fits well with some happy ones as well as 'LET'S KICK SOME ZOMBIE BUTT\" music. Very enjoyable. )\n\n+ Graphics (Pixel art as the main art style, it's simple but it shows it really well. I do wish the characters faces look a little better but hopefully in a sequel or such, they'll make it better)\n\n+ Dogs/Cats are playable (They can loot and shoot...SOLD! )\n\nI don't have much cons for this game but I'll just give my little nit picks\n\nNitpicks:\n\n- RNG (RNG is what makes the fun and despair of a game though I feel that a lot of bad stuffs happen more to me IMO. Though that's part of the fun so take this as a grain of salt.)\n\n- More character customization ( I know this is a pro but I do want more clothes or at least a workshop for this game. If there's mods I would love to see it happen)\n\nOverall, I give this game a 9/10. I would have given it a 10 if it had a lot more customization than now because the game literally screams for one. If this game were to get a sequel then I'd be a happy man. If you love zombies, surviving, FTL-like games, maybe this might be for you. Otherwise, just look at a video or 2 of gameplay and see if it convinces you to buy.\n\nHIGHLY RECOMMENDED!", "timestamp_created": 1479967750, "timestamp_updated": 1511488312, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.602217", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27027793": {"recommendationid": "27027793", "author": {"steamid": "76561198135594443", "num_games_owned": 17, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 67, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479963854}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6709\u8da3\u7684\u6e38\u620f\nbgm\u5f88\u9b54\u6027\n\u4f46\u662f\u770b\u82f1\u6587\u597d\u7d2f", "timestamp_created": 1479963621, "timestamp_updated": 1479963621, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503242", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27014443": {"recommendationid": "27014443", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084094255", "num_games_owned": 125, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 189, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497745909}, "language": "english", "review": "-Friend has hella buff trait\n-Friend hears about guy who benches zombies and rips them in half\n-friend runs into woods and benches a tree\n-friend gains +1 strength to his already godly strength and becomes \"to swole to control\"\n-I shudder in terror as the meat pile crawls into the Hotdog car\n-we drive on quietly on our quest for the Canadian border\n\n10/10 would turn friend into godly vein pile again", "timestamp_created": 1479960287, "timestamp_updated": 1479960287, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27008298": {"recommendationid": "27008298", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086789424", "num_games_owned": 125, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 2288, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493798061}, "language": "english", "review": "Told A Swole Dude to COOL IT 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1479958679, "timestamp_updated": 1479958679, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26986008": {"recommendationid": "26986008", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034712351", "num_games_owned": 345, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 286, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481613848}, "language": "english", "review": "My dog told me to \"Cool it\".  10/10", "timestamp_created": 1479953095, "timestamp_updated": 1479953095, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26979992": {"recommendationid": "26979992", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038346399", "num_games_owned": 701, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 300, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498301827}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is great.

We've known each other since we were small. Together we survived some pretty prickly situations and we met a few friends along the way, Rusty and Jacinda. \n\nWe were a rag tag group of survivors content on the idea of making it to Canada. Things were looking great but unfortunately that didn't last long. We had lost our car and were forced to trek on foot. \n\nAfter what seemed to be an eternity, we spotted a cabin and a van that resembled a dog. After fighting through the horde of zombies, we managed to find the keys. We struggled to make it back to the van, but we were on our way to Canada once again!\n\nWe all were in need of rest after the all the excitement we had endured during the day so we had found an empty house along the roadside. Night was falling upon us, as leader, I appointed Jacinda to barricade duty. This was a fatal decision on my part as leader. I may not have been perfect but I always seemed to keep us on top. Night had fallen and we were surrounded by zombies. With Jacinda's lackluster job, they had been able to break in and we had lost Nic and Rusty. Jacinda and I had narrowly escaped with our lives. \n\nBitter towards Jacinda, I knew ultimately it was my decision which had led to the death of my childhood friend, Nic, and our beloved teammate, Rusty. Even after these events, we couldn't forget our initial goal of this journey. It was to make it to Canada. The sacrifice of our friend's could not be in vain. Once again, we pushed on.\n\nLow on supplies and down to just the two of us, we decided to enter a nearby town to gear up. The rain helped muffle our sounds enough to push past the large packs of angry and aggressive zombies. We found a house with enough supplies to last us the remainder of our trip. Now we just needed to get back to our van.\n\nOn our way out the door, we noticed the large packs had moved to the outside of the house we were in, and sadly, we were spotted. We had tried to stand our ground, but were quickly overwhelmed and were forced to run. Making a mad dash to our van, we had gotten ourselves surrounded. \n\nIt was in that moment that Jacinda had taken her hatchet and started fighting and pushing her way through one side. Myself and a bloody and beaten Jacinda had managed to make it to the doorway of a small house. She was bitten all over and we both knew that it was over for her. She told me to go inside without her. She said she was sorry but this is where her story ends. Reluctantly, I turned and closed the door.\n\nHere I sit in this small house, alone and waiting for my impending doom while I write this letter. Moans and sounds of limbs banging against the door. I feel at peace.\n\n10/10 Simulator for when 'murica falls because of the Trumpster.

It constantly fucks you over and many of your losses will be completely down to RNG.

You'll take a deep sigh as the game pits you against swarms of unrelenting hordes armed with a human femur, yet I'm strangely ok with it.\n\nSimply put, Death Road To Canada is the kind of game where I don't mind losing because of all the crazy stories I'll get out of the experience. If you go in expecting something tough but fair like FTL you'll be screaming at your monitor in anger but if you simply go in to create your friends, family and Persian leaders circa 423-404 BC and watch as everything goes horribly, horribly wrong you'll be laughing through the pain.\n\nFor example, I had a party of myself, a friend, Emperor Palpatine and a dog we found on the way named Milo. During a raid of a mostly empty house Palpatine decided now was the time to use that molotov he'd been saving in a small hallway which I had been standing in. Myself and my friend were burnt to a crisp and it was up to Palpatine and his dog to carry on our legacy.\n\nThey died when he told an armed bandit to cool it.\n\nAt 15\u20ac the game feels a tad overpriced what with games like the aforementioned FTL being only \u20ac10 which I'd argue have much more replayability and depth but on the whole I'd reccomend Death Road To Canada as a fun little game to toy around in every now and then.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1478963348, "timestamp_updated": 1478963348, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000",

The first thing I'd like to lead off with is that I play with a controller and have yet to play with keyboard beause controller just feels so damn good! Although the turorial is only for keyboard it takes less than a minute of experimentation to draw the parallels. The game has three sections: Driving, where you can view your vehicle status, equipment screens, progress, and make important party decisions; Exploration, where you send out selected party members to scavenge for materials, weapons or to trade with caravans; and Seige, where all members must fight a formiddable horde of zombies for a set amount of time before they have the opportunity to escape. \n\n     Pros: \n- Customizable characters adds investment \n- Random events keep the game interesting\n- Training stats levels up custom character perks\n- Great mix of bad-ass-ery and Unexpected Chaos\n\n     Cons:\n- AI will trade thier weapon slots at thier discretion\n- RNG can be brutal or too forgiving\n- Minor/ rare bugs can spoil a good run\n- A pug had better 'Wits' than me\n\n      The first thing I would suggest is creating yourself and your best friend or significant other and playing through the normal campaign three times. Then, once you strart to understand how the game generally works, fill the first 2 of the eight pages with other friends, family members, or any random people you've always dreamed of surviving the apocalypse with and play through the 'custom characters ONLY' campaign - this is where I found the most enjoyment. \n\n     This game is absolutely worth the $15 spent, and I highly reccomend it to anyone who is looking for something fresh to play by themselves or with a buddy.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1478385116, "timestamp_updated": 1478385116, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26426802": {"recommendationid": "26426802", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039598318", "num_games_owned": 128, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 156, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478309857}, "language": "english", "review": "looked good in theory, just didn't pan out. not sure how some of these games have such high reviews, so i gotta try to even it out i guess", "timestamp_created": 1478310095, "timestamp_updated": 1478310095, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.253615", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26414428": {"recommendationid": "26414428", "author": {"steamid": "76561198089736677", "num_games_owned": 227, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 469, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500910807}, "language": "english", "review": "Zo my first game went pretty decent,\n\nStarted up with 2 guys, shortly after met up with Rambaux, he was strong, killed tons of Zombies.\nThen i met up with 'n other friend, he joined us. and we went on, it was then that Rambaux revealed the demon inside him, who demanded Pizza.

This game is like a end of the world action Oregon Trail but to Canada. The best part of this game is risking spelunking somewhere and escaping with a bounty of items that you really needed. Nothing is ever the same and with a balance of intelligent survival decisions and zombie slaying skills. It's fun as hell finding a shotgun with your shooter and getting buckets of ammo as your buddy tanks for you. The skill system is paramount and works very well in a game like this. It's good, like in all RPGs', to have a balanced group. One should be a good car guy another a leading melee, another a medic guy. What is fun is customizing the players after your family/friends/idles for the game and then randomly stumble upon them to recruit.\n\nWhat I dont like about this game is that there seems to be way more failures and bad luck than the opposite. It seems that trying to balance supplies in food, gas, medical supplies never works. You either run out of gas too quick or run out of food too quick. Then when stopping for supplies you seem to always find ammo and little of everything else. Then ontop of that there are moral and vehicle levels. Bandits are the true enemy in this game. It seems like you can never detur them no matter what your skills. Admittingly the wits roll system is a mystery to me but mood and moral and other array of skills never seems to detur these bandits. You must suffer their wrath. I think the game takes a bit too much of the risk factor.\n\nThe moral system is nice. Traveling with your pals into the wasteland and someone farts in the car, you blame someone and they get angry and then moral goes down. Soon someone gets kicked out of the group because of it. As I said, failing for the most part is fun. Its a good risk reward factor, many choices, skill adaptations, strengths and weaknesses and handicaps and advantages. A variety of weapons and goodies. \n\nGame example 1. Doing well, got a nice bounty of loot. Time passed too much and zombies increased in swarms, got overwhelmed. Died on day 7.  Game example 2. Was getting low on food, encountered a group of people fending off a bandit shootout.If we are successful we get 15 food. Choices: Help, build defences, ignore. I chose to help and party was wiped. (Even though my leader was skilled in shooting.) Game example 3. Junkyard swarmed with a group of people needing help. We lose 2 on the way to them. We find them and try to lead them back to the car.

Death Road to Canada uses a similar system, however instead of walking through dungeons you are adventuring on to Canada. On your way to Canada you will experience a vast number of different events. These events can range from meeting travellers that end up joining your party to encountering bandit, bodybuilding enthusiasts. These events are the foundation for the game and offer plenty of re-playability to the game itself. \n\nExploration\nMoving on from the in-game events, lets address one of the negatives I have with the game, exploration. Each building you venture into is extremely lacking in the creativity department. Most buildings will be filled with gas, food and weapons. The problem is to find all of them, you will want to search every room, this creates very boring scenarios of you and your friend searching through empty rooms which are literally empty. They could have atleast added some furniture to make them feel more authentic, but instead if you enter a room with nothing but a bunch of garbage blocking off a door. You instantly know to turn around because it will be one of the MANY empty and pointless rooms in this game. Just to clarify my criticism here Is that the rooms are completely baron of ANYTHING, they didn\u2019t have to contain usable items, but I would have liked to see these rooms contain some sort of personality or baring. Not only did this make exploration, long and arduous but it really encouraged players to skip exploring entirely If they already had enough supplies to last them a while. \n\nVisuals/Graphics\nAnd now is the part of every review where I talk graphics. Now this game has that same pixelated art style we have all become VERY familiar with over the years. It seems that after one game tried using this retro look EVERY possible indie promotion started using it for reasons I can\u2019t recognise. Luckily here it fits decently, as the world created around your survivors is wacky enough to fit the strange 80\u2019s style visuals. \n\nPerformance\nNo surprise here with its low CPU and GPU intensive graphics, the game runs fineand they offer you some nice, complementary options; fliters for the screen if you want to go full 80's mode, stylistic screen tearing toggle options and fully rebindable keys. I should also mention that all actions in the game can be changed on controller as well as the keyboard, when you are playing co-op with a friend I found that this was a nifty addition to controller users.\n\nMusic\nAs for the music, it\u2019s quite strange. Normally in a zombie game where you\u2019re fighting for survival you wouldn\u2019t have fun up-beat music sounding off in the background. But much like the visuals it works well with the cheesy game the developers are creating. It took me a while to get used to it but after I did, I can\u2019t imagine going back to the solemn soundtracks of past zombie games. \n\nCombat\nCombat feels decent enough, it doesn\u2019t take away anything from the game but it felt too basic to warrant praise of any kind. In combat you can use guns, melee weapons and explosives. Melee weapons use up your character\u2019s stamina, your character\u2019s stamina is measured in the traits your character has unlocked. Obviously more physically athletic survivors will be able to use their melee weapon for longer without getting tired. The gun play is fine, the game automatically locks on to zombies you are facing which works well enough. I am slightly dissapointed as it felt like the developers were catering a little too much to the controller users rather than the much more plentiful keyboard and mouse users, thsi is ecspecially the case with the gun play, it felt like their main goal was to dumb it down completely so that controller users wouldn't be left behind by the vastly superior PC controls. But in saying that, it's not necessarily a bad system of combat, I just feel like it takes away the benefit of using a keyboard and mouse to a slight degree, and let me highlight the word slight, this is a MINOR nitpick. \n\nConclusion\nOverall Death Road to Canada is a fun game to play with your friends, you can laugh at the random events that occur and dance to the funky music playing in the background while killing zombies constantly. However, without friends this game is quite bland, exploration is quite a linear experience and on your own the combat feels dreadfully average.", "timestamp_created": 1476500229, "timestamp_updated": 1481714057, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.657323", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26039899": {"recommendationid": "26039899", "author": {"steamid": "76561198188389862", "num_games_owned": 26, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 635, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496426005}, "language": "english", "review": "NO KEYBOARD SUPPORT!\n\nEdit: I forgot to put \"Mouse and...\" sorry.", "timestamp_created": 1476495431, "timestamp_updated": 1476554202, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.359851", "comment_count": "8", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26023166": {"recommendationid": "26023166", "author": {"steamid": "76561198097927024", "num_games_owned": 138, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 3539, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498259025}, "language": "english", "review": "Gucci game, I give it a COOL IT out of 10.", "timestamp_created": 1476417057, "timestamp_updated": 1476417057, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.470383", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26003153": {"recommendationid": "26003153", "author": {"steamid": "76561198117968117", "num_games_owned": 269, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 577, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496762939}, "language": "english", "review": "A great game to play with friends!", "timestamp_created": 1476302531, "timestamp_updated": 1476302531, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25984405": {"recommendationid": "25984405", "author": {"steamid": "76561198274514767", "num_games_owned": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3250, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513011133}, "language": "english", "review": "what other zombie survival game could you find genies coming from toilets, aliens and an anime girl? to name a few of the crazy scenarios you can find yourself in, I'm sure there are a load more of weird and wonderful events I have yet to come across.

I'm getting pretty addicted to this game and wanting to get to Canada (as my character of course).\n\nYou start off as a survivor and maybe a buddy wanting to go to Canada as heard from the game is the safest place in the World and go through many places to gather supplies and loot to survive your road trip there. With the RNG system you can either get good or bad rolls. It can also depend on your character's traits and perks to which the system gives you. Usually the trait gives good and bad side effects and the perk gives you a good one. The game starts to get difficult as you progress through the game and gets pretty intense too. \n\nThe only troubles I've been having are sieges being really difficult especially with the RNG paths it gives me, but it doesn't stop me from giving hope that I can make it to Canada! \n\nSo far I've made it to Canada once in Rare Characters mode. L*nk (Don't sue N*ntendo) is pretty much the the best Rare Characters from at least my view since his [spoiler]sword upgrades[/spoiler]  are pretty much OP.\n\nI highly recommend this game for people who love Organ Trail and difficult games.\n10/10 for me! :D", "timestamp_created": 1473468579, "timestamp_updated": 1479924248, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.584665", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25430322": {"recommendationid": "25430322", "author": {"steamid": "76561198098886176", "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 5466, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509416204}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is a blast!

I wasted a lot of time.\n\nPositive:\n\nIt's a real blast if you play with someone, and it increase the replayability if you are bored with some friend.\n\nA lot of funny characters that raised my curiosity and kept me playing, funny and rare events; I found a gennie trapped in a WC, an alien landing and a man in black with funny dialogs, a weirdo guy in fairy costume granting wishes ect.. After beating the normal mode, there are a lot of extra mode and I'm planning to beat a couple of them.\n\nVery catchy tune, It's just a game where you sit down and chill. You can create you own characters, with their own traits and perks, I made some friend in it and characters with various perks(perks can level up, 3 level in total) so I tried a lot of combinations, every game was diferent and when i lose, It doesn't feel like a punishment, making a new game exciting.\n\nNegative: \n\nThe gameplay it's very simple and it's good but can make it repetitive.\n\nI don't know how it works, but sometimes it seems unfair, basically you need luck. Sometime is really hard to find suply, other times you have to much of it. Bad events in a row, or good events in a row.\n\nOnly local 2 player max. You can make a team of 4 four peoples, but you can only play with one friend. IT'S A HUGE MISSOPORTUNITY. A game like this it's very party friendly. I had time when friends are just watching and taking turns for every game.\n\nLow variety of normal events. FOR GOD SAKE TO MUCH GOLF CAMPS IN MURICA.\n\nRarely, the AI will take strange path to get with you, making it frustrating waiting them.(I know, very specifical) \n\nOverall:\n\nWorth my money.

If there\u2019s a game that could prove that the zombie genre isn\u2019t quite out of fuel just yet, Death Road to Canada and the broken down lemon it rides around in is definitely that game.\n\nhttp://tay.kinja.com/road-to-canada-the-notgoodforreview-1786255541", "timestamp_created": 1473202217, "timestamp_updated": 1473225728, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25387771": {"recommendationid": "25387771", "author": {"steamid": "76561198235124200", "num_games_owned": 17, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 823, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483213467}, "language": "english", "review": "everytime I play or watch something related to zombies.I keep getting dream that I in a zombie apocalypse.", "timestamp_created": 1473200505, "timestamp_updated": 1473200505, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495826", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25382827": {"recommendationid": "25382827", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995058928", "num_games_owned": 294, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 1167, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476846383}, "language": "english", "review": "contains memes and anime", "timestamp_created": 1473179457, "timestamp_updated": 1473179457, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.569425", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25374149": {"recommendationid": "25374149", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060141305", "num_games_owned": 83, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 644, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498059321}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty funny game EH", "timestamp_created": 1473125933, "timestamp_updated": 1473125933, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495826", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25372972": {"recommendationid": "25372972", "author": {"steamid": "76561198096571237", "num_games_owned": 71, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 340, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478965070}, "language": "english", "review": "Got a dog to sing like elvis while blasting zombies with a shotgun.\n10/10\nWould \"COOL IT\" again\n", "timestamp_created": 1473118720, "timestamp_updated": 1473118720, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496602", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25372930": {"recommendationid": "25372930", "author": {"steamid": "76561198328034746", "num_games_owned": 86, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2518, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494477692}, "language": "english", "review": "I am currently a little in love with this game.

Kiara, Rosaline, and their dog, Billy, were cruising down the Death Road to Canada. They had over 200 gas, over 30 food, 20 medical kits, and more ammo and weapons than they know what to do with. They were a happy family, eating marshmallows and telling scary stories around the fire.\nThen... everything changed when the group of bandits attacked.\nKiara was killed. But that wasn't the worst part. The dog was killed. Sweet little Billy. Struck down in his prime. Rosaline was all alone.\nSo she traveled on. The car broke down. She walked alone, through the rain. She didn't have time to mourn the lost of her dearest friends... her only friends. Then, when all hope was gone, while looting an apartment, Rosaline found a dog, Jeanette. She adopted Jeanette and they traveled onwards.\nThe two comrades happened upon a junkyard that had a decent car. At the junkyard was another dog that joined them in their new car. Jeanin was one of them now. Their family was growing. They were all smiles and laughs. Jeanette loved to stick her fluffy doggy head out the window.\nAnd another dog, Virginia, found them on the road and joined them! Rosalin was surrounded by sweet, loving, zombie-killing dogs. What more could she ask for?\nBut one apartment... there were too many zombies. Rosalin was seperated from her beloved dog. She slashed at the rotting zombies with her rusty machete but she was too tired. Her arms went limp at her side as she felt teeth rip into her flesh. She looked at Jeanette one last time... her last breath was a single, whispering word:\n\"Canada.\"\nThe fluffy little dog gathered up her friends, her comrades, her family, and fled the apartment, leaving behind the skeleton of her beloved master. With that one word echoing in her mind, Jeanette jumped in the front seat of the car and taught herself to drive. They were going to get to Canada.\nThe three dogs fought and fought for over a week. They battled their ways through sieges, through swarms, through factories, through grocery stores, through the skeletons of the hundreds of humans who had died in their journey to Canada. So many had died. But these little dogs were making it.\nThey were less than two days away. They stopped at a trading camp one last time. The traders took pity on the three dogs and gave them some free ammo. The dogs were eterneally grateful.\nBut Rosalin had had all the guns.\nThe dogs didn't have any guns.\nOne last stop before reaching Canada.\nThey were trapped in a house.\nIt was a siege. They just had to survive long enough and then escape.\nZomies were raining from the ceilings, flooding through the door as a flood of death and gore. No other human had ever gotten this far before. Not even close. But these dogs. These brave dogs, Jeanette, Jeanin, Virginia... they had done what no other human had done. They had gotten to Canada.\nAlmost.\nJeanette was the first to die as she desperately tried to lead the pack of zombies away from her comrades and from the door which would soon be open. But the house was too small. She was overwhelmed.\nJeanin took over. Sweet little Virginia was being overwhelmed. Jeanin ran in, batting the zombie away, scratching and biting them to protect Virginia, who was quickly becoming tired. Jeanin succeeded in her goal, but only after she died.\nVirginia. She was all alone. The zombies were busy feasting upon the carcasses of Jeanette and Jeanin. Virginia ran towards the door. The siege wasn't over but it was almost time for that blessed door to be free. She would be ready.\nBut the zombies were far more ready than she was.\nThey were waiting right outside the door and came rushing in to greet her. Virginia fought her way to the door and tried to leave.\n\"It is unsafe to go outside right now.\"\nShe couldn't leave. Not yet. She tried to run away. She fought and fought and fought... but it was all for naught. She was less than a foot away from the exit.\nThe zombies circled her and Virginia's body fell to the floor as they bit and scratched her. Her blood was ripped out from her veins and her limbs were devoured by the growling mass of zombies. As her soul slowly left her eyes, she could see one last sign...\n\"The siege is over. It's safe to go outside.\"\nOne day away.\nOne driving day away from Canada.\nAlmost.\n\n10/10 would get a pack of dogs to drive a car to Canada again.", "timestamp_created": 1472836924, "timestamp_updated": 1472836924, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "4.990025", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25294922": {"recommendationid": "25294922", "author": {"steamid": "76561197985127477", "num_games_owned": 341, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 7457, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512152190}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Faster than Light+ apocalipsis zombie+ referencias a series/cine/juegos + juego que no se toma en serio a s\u00ed mismo = Death Road to Canada.\n\nSi eres fan del g\u00e9nero Roguelike/lite y todo lo que ello conlleva (juegos como The Binding of Isaac, el citado Faster Than Light, Rogue Legacy, etc, etc, etc) y te gustan los eventos aleatorios, la toma de decisiones arriesgadas, los sucesos est\u00fapidos y aleatorios y machacar zombies, este es tu juego.\n\nEl combate no es la panacea ni mucho menos, aunque cumple y de momento, s\u00f3lo est\u00e1 en ingl\u00e9s (no se si se espera traducci\u00f3n en el futuro). \n\nEl juego es relativamente dif\u00edcil conforme llegas al final de cada run, pero es como cabr\u00eda de esperar por el g\u00e9nero al que pertenece el juego. \n\nEmpiezas con uno o dos supervivientes en un apocalipsis zombie y tu objetivo es aguantar durante 15 d\u00edas de viaje (en el modo est\u00e1ndar, luego tiene otros varios) desde Florida hasta Canad\u00e1 (que por alguna extra\u00f1a raz\u00f3n que no spoilear\u00e9, est\u00e1 libre de zombies).

The games RNG heavy events with higher penaltys seem to become more frequent nearing the end ( this may just be perception) but heres what makes this game frustrating just before the End you are faced with a final Siege (a small map with thousands of zombies spawning and chasing you until the timer runs out) the timer for which is about 4times as long as the average siege and is impossible to survive with all characters.\nBut now you've done it, you can finally go to canada, except there's another final Challenge after the final challenge, this one is easier you can simply dodge the zombies (since you'll most likely be alone).\nChallenge and getting f**ed by RNG can be a lot of fun if it's not ridiculously unfair.

The game plays a bit like Oregon Trail in terms of managing resources like food and bullets while traveling across the country.  You also have to make decisions about how to handle various situations that come up, like running into a massive group of zombies and having to decide whether to take a detour or try to plow through them.  Depending on the traits of your characters, you may have additional options in these instances.  \n\nThe other half of the game is running around city streets and various buildings searching for supplies while avoiding getting killed by zombies.  The combat can feel a little clunky, particularly when dealing with doors and corners, but doesn't detract from the game too much.  Character movement also feels a little flawed.  Navigating corners and narrow spaces can get a bit frustrating when your character seemingly gets stuck on nothing.  I also found the companion AI to be a bit annoying at times.  Their path-finding can be frustrating, they will often continue to walk into objects instead of just walking around them.\n\nThis game really shines in it's character design, decision making, and quirky humor.  You're able to give your characters a perk, like mechanical or medical skills, and personality trait, like being calm under fire or paranoid.  It creates humorous situations like when your co-worker complains about Mondays the whole trip, or when your fitness obsessed friend challenges bandits to a body builder pose-off.  \n\nOverall I found this game to be a very enjoyable experience.  I would recommend this game to people who enjoy replaying games to see all the different outcomes to different decisions you make.  If your goal is to just get through the game to see the end, there may not be enough value here for you.

There is no specific story since the vibe of the game is almost a make-your-own adventure type and RNG does play a high role in the gameplay. Although there is no story as such, along the way you\u2019ll meet new survivors and NPCs (if you stay alive long enough) and there is plenty of dialogue and little random events.\n\n[b]General Gameplay[/b]\nWhen you start the game you\u2019ll begin with a few supplies like food and medicine and your car (which is where a good chunk of your gameplay will be spent). You\u2019ll travel in your car (or on foot if you happen to run out of gas or break your vehicle) and it\u2019ll be from there you\u2019ll encounter random events, traders, new locations, bandits and even sometimes new survivors to join your group. Travelling in your car will consume gas and travelling no matter how you do it will also consume food which is one of the most important resources. Without food your group will starve, the more they starve the lower their \u2018morale\u2019 drops and once a person's morale is completely gone it is highly likely they will abandon the group. The more group members you have the more manpower you wield but also you\u2019ll consume more food so remember that when picking up new survivors.\nAlong your journey you\u2019ll find various location that you\u2019ll have the choice to loot if you wish too but you can also choose to pass them by. Sometimes you\u2019ll find a solitary location and others you\u2019ll find two to pick from and each location's name will be kinda relative to what you find at that location e.g supermarket = food, hardware store = melee weapons. Displayed alongside the location name will also be details of the location you\u2019re about to enter such as the size of the zombie swarm, how aggressive they are and the time of day. These three things massively affect whether you\u2019re successful at that location or not so you do have to take them into consideration when playing or you\u2019ll quickly end up as zombie chow. Once you\u2019ve assigned any weapons you may have to your survivors you can enter your location where you\u2019ll be able to loot and kill at will. You\u2019ll usually find a bit of loot and maybe an NPC, sometimes you\u2019ll find something a little more rare. \nEach survivor has hidden stats which you won\u2019t be able to see until they need to be used or you level them up for example you won't know if John is a good Mechanic until he tries to fix a car or increases that specific skill. Most survivors start pretty weak but the progression system in the game increases each trait that survivors randomly have as you complete specific things throughout your runs. \nMy favourite part of Death Road To Canada is the ability to add all your friends/family/enemies/acquaintances to the game as survivors you\u2019ll have a chance to meet along the way. You\u2019re able to name them, choose what they look like and wear and their traits and then either load them into your game from the start as your starting survivors or hope to come across them randomly in normal gameplay. There is a mode that increases your chances of coming across custom survivors so if you want to play a game where you\u2019re likely to find all your friends then you can. The Custom Game Mode isn\u2019t the only game mode you\u2019ll find though, there are several ranging from change in difficulty to change in your trip length so there are lots of options for replayability if you manage to beat the normal main campaign (good luck).\n\n[b]Sound and Graphics[/b]\nThe graphics are pixel graphics and though I do enjoy the \u2018old-school\u2019 feel to them sometimes I have trouble seeing some things clearly, especially the larger the screen I play it on. \nThe soundtrack is truly fantastic though! Instead of what you\u2019d expect of a normal zombie survival game it takes an upbeat approach instead and the juxtaposition is fantastic. The whole package has a very nice retro feel to it and brings back some nostalgic feelings of the games on older consoles.\n\n[b]Pros[/b]\n--- Randomized events, survivors and locations for replayability.\n--- Local Co-Op so your friends can help you smash some zombies.\n--- Fantastic soundtrack.\n--- Difficult yet rewarding gameplay.\n--- Customizability with survivors you can create yourself to encounter when you play. \n--- Various game modes\n--- Awesome soundtrack (yet not available for purchase )-: )\n---[spoiler]GNOMEY.[/spoiler]\n\n[b]Cons[/b]\n--- Full controller support yet instructions are keyboard keys only.\n--- No achievements?!?!?!?!\n--- Sieges can be a real pain in the...foot. Some are just a little too difficult.\n\n[b]Summary[/b]\nDeath Road To Canada to put it plainly is a great game with a hell of a lot of fun to be had. The randomization and various game-modes adds a great deal of replayability and the fact you can customize the game and add your own characters gives it a great feel. There's plenty of content included and for the hours of gameplay you\u2019ll get out of it the price is more than fair.

I paid for the through the Kickstarter, but some people would see that as still getting the game for free. It's all in perspective, so take it as you may.\n\nI love the Oregon Trail style to it. The randomness and wittiness that comes from characters, and trying to put your own friends and family in the game to find later on. That's where the real charm comes in, I think. Seeing how your friends react to in-game events and then telling your friends about those experiences out of the game.\n\nFor example, going through a mall that had umbrellas laying about everywhere. Each character can carry up to three weapons, and one of my friends AI in game decided to go and pick up three umbrellas to stash away in their inventory. Definitely made for a good story and a couple of laughs.\n\nThis game was never really made out to be serious. It's a fun little project that I'm honestly quite glad that I've been a part of from the Kickstarter all the way to the release. The gameplay can be repetitive, and the combat can be tiresome, but I think that just adds to it. Finding yourself backed into a corner with a horde of zombies quickly approaching, or fighting your way desperately through the sewers to try and find the exit. It's quite fun, despite its bit of shortcomings.\n\nAs far as issues I currently have, the main ones would be the AI getting hung up on walls or objects blocking their way out the door of rooms. Online co-op would be awesome, and I feel would definitely add to this game. Or even up to four players locally.\n\nIt is difficult to actually complete. RNGesus enusres that. But the random events that happen, sometimes rare events, make each playthrough fairly unique and amusing.

The game presents itself in two different play-styles: an Oregan Trail like decision making rpg overworld, and a Nuclear Throne like top down fighter where you scavenge for supplies and weapons. There is also a character customisation where you can design your own characters and give them particular traits to spice up the character, or you can find randomly generated characters to adenture with, topped with some preset special characters that have unique dialog, abilities and weapons. All of this is presented in beautiful and detailed pixel art.\n\nI only have two gripes with DR2C,\n-Its difficulty if the first. While I understand that it is a rougelike and your chances of winning consistantly without a high level of practice are very low. This game also heavily relies on good RNG on your characters stats and the events they are put in; which may turn people off. Generally I find there are two ways you can play DR2C, you either play silly in order to have fun, often resulting in bad things happening due to you telling everyone to \"COOL IT\", or you can play super optimally and boring, usually resulting in higher chances of victory but takes away some charm the game has.\n-The second is the small amount of bugs the game has. So far my game is unable to enter fullscreen and just makes the screen black, which I assume is a resolution issue. The other problem that has only happened once is the game randomly crashing presenting you with an error code. However, being a newly released game with updates coming out every day, these problems are sure to be fixed if not shortly, in the future.\n\nOverall DR2C is a great pick up game with runs lasting around 30-60 minutes, packed full with hilarious dialog and a vast array of characters. Good times will be had with this game, but if RNG reliant games bug you, you might want to wait till this title is on sale.

The dynamic story however is a great feature, as different orgeon-trail style events transpire to spice up gameplay. From intelligent dogs to Giant Farts Monthly, the game is never short on curveballs to therow at you. It's a genuinely funny game that doesn't lean too hard on reference humor. Also, side note, but the character customization is oodles of fun. I spent probably an hour or so just making my characters. The best part of it is that they can sometimes show up in the game, so Johnny Joes the master mechanic is not just tied down to being picked as my buddy. The gameplay is the only real weak point of this game, but it's perfectly passable and probably going to get better as the game grows (fingers crossed).

I looted a few stores here and there gathering food and medical supplies for my journey ahead. After gathering some supplies, a woman named Jetta wanted to join my group! I was excited and anxious to see what the future had in store for the two of us. We got along pretty well, she always told me to shut up, but I think she was just flirting. All of a sudden, our first siege came upon us! Luckily it wasn't too big of a horde and, I had gathered enough bullets for my pistol to hold off the zombies until we could escape. We made it out alive, our first siege. We had been through a lot after only being together for a day or two. I think our relationship was really beginning to blossom! We were getting closer and closer to Canada, we could taste the free health care. Then another lone survivor came across my group! His name was Drew and he claimed that he had a very skilled background in medicine! I was happy to hear that because a doctor is always a plus in the zombie apocalypse! \n\nMe, Drew, Jetta, fighting through grocery stores and small towns in search of more supplies to aid us in our survival. After looting some stores, we came across the greatest loot we would ever find, his name, Alessandro, the most loyal creature in the world, Alessandro the hero hound. The 4 of us continued on our journey, we were running low on medical supplies, and Jetta was very low on health, living on the edge between life and death. We stopped in a junk yard in the hopes of finding more medical supplies, and more gas. The horde here was massive, it wasn't looking good for the group. We rummaged through old broken down cars and piles of rubble, no medical supplies, but I did find a safe with a bunch of gas so that helped. I wanted to stay a little longer to see if we could find anything to heal Jetta. That was when I knew that I made a horrible mistake, we were cornered, the only way out was through a horde of 40+ zombies. Swinging our hatchets and kitchen knives we fought as hard as we could through the horde to try and get Jetta out and to safety, but...it was too late, Jetta's baseball bat snapped in the middle of the horde...One bite to the neck...Jetta went down. The zombies began ripping her to shreds, all we could do was watch. We had to get out of there before the zombies got to us too, \"BARK! BARK!\" Alessandro said as we drove off from the junkyard. A truly emotional loss for the group, but its survival of the fittest and we had to move on. \n\nRight after our junkyard disaster we came across a SIEGE! I was low on health and I had no ammo for my pistol. Drew had a strange looking orange knife and I thought to myself, WOW HE HAS SOME SORT OF LEGENDARY WEAPON, but no...it was just a rusty machete. The siege horde was massive, and we were stuck in a building with no rooms. Zombies came flooding in through the door, we hacked away at their rotting heads hoping to make it out alive! I was down to my last few breaths, I was exhausted from swinging my hatchet, my hits were doing no damage, I had to run into another corner to recuperate while Drew and Alessandro kept fighting. I regained my strength and dove back into the zombies, FOR ALESSANDRO!!! I yelled. Drew was slightly offended but he didn't have time to get angry, because a zombie had grabbed me by the leg right as I dove into the horde. I went down, as the zombies ate away at my insides and I let out my final screams of life, I heard Drew and Alessandro scamper out of the house, they made it out alive. \n\nThen there were two, Drew and Alessandro the hero hound. Their drive to their next location did not last long, they came across an impassable obstacle, they were doomed, and they knew it from the start, it was...The River of Death. Drew and Alessandro ran into the wet, dark, zombie filled maze. Alessandro sprinted ahead to find an escape route while Drew followed far behind fighting through the zombies with an old kitchen knife. Alessandro needed help fighting the zombies and was also having trouble finding an escape route, so he ran back to find Drew. They met eyes from across the hall...there was a look of shock on Drew's face, he had nowhere to run, zombies were latched on to his legs. He was dragged to the floor as almost a hundred zombies hurried to his corpse to get their long awaited meal. \n\nAlessandro knew he couldn't stay in this hell hole. He was low on health and didn't know if he would make it out alive, but he had to try. He ran as fast as he could dodging left and right between massive groups of zombies. He busted through 3 or 4 doors trying to find the light to the outside. He knew he was getting close, but he could hear zombies all around him, his adrenalin spiked and he began to run faster than he had ever run before. Alessandro ran through a door into a long empty hallway, he was home free! He thought he was...the hallway ran out...the splashes of water coming from hundreds of zombies filled the room at the end of the hallway. With zombies in front of him marching towards, and plenty of zombies still hungry from Drew's devouring, Alessandro had no choice. He had to hope that there was a door to the outside through this massive crowd, he went for it. The zombies grabbed at him and snatched at his weak legs hoping to bring him down just like they did to Drew. Alessandro could see the light! The doorway to freedom! The road to Canada was just in front of him waiting to be taken on for at least a bit longer! He was almost out of the horde, he could smell the air from outside, he kicked it into high gear! Sprinting for his life and hoping to avenge the others and make it to Canada! Alessandro knew he had made it past the horde, until...he felt a tug at his leg, he FLEW BACK into the horde!! Alessandro yelped and howled for his friends, but they were all gone, the dream of making it to Canada was lost. RIP Alessandro, we will never forget you,\n\nIf you have read up to this point, thank you very much, this took me forever to write.

This game is great. Usually don't do reviews, but the game deserves more recognition.\n\nBasically it's oregon trail, with FTL choice options affected by your teams stats. Light RPG elements. Light resource management. And a real time scavenging / combat with a dumb-AI squad every couple of minutes. The combat is basic, but it's still fun. The main draw is the story of all the great / horrible things that happen to your guys on the road. You can create a pool of custom characters that you find. This is highly reccomended. Makes the journey personal and enhances the humor in that sims sort of way when your characters drop everything and decide to go mini golfing. This might, if someone on your squard has a bad attitude stat, backfire and result in Stacey throwing the ball to ruin the game (typical Stacey). You might find your team squabbling over a lone candy bar, or deciding whether or not to shack up at a creepy old lady's \"inn\". Then your friend Bill starts Obama-bashing in the car.\n\nPros:\n-Looks polished, the retro graphics don't feel like a cheap shortcut\n-Good music / sfx, if slightlyyyyy repetitive. But only slightly. Zombies have a nice SQUISH.\n-Humor is on point. The game strikes a great tone of lightheartedness. The \"full tilt random\" stuff is just rare enough to be exciting. But they do have a mode where all that gets cranked up if it's more your style. The base game itself is more restrained than the trailer will have you believe, but I'd say that's a good thing.\n-Every run is different. It's even fun to die and start over.\n-One month in, Devs still balancing and adding a few things.\n-Suprising number of zombies on screen.\n-2 player couch coop, shared screen. Haven't tried it yet, but I've heard it's \"okay\" if a little buggy.\n\nCons:\n-Perks are a bit unbalanced. For instance, paranoid and mechanic are VERY good at the moment. Some are pretty lame.\n-No online or lan multi- but for this price point it's not bad. Devs are planning split screen supposedly.\n-Some AI pathing issues / bugs might result in death. But after it happens once or twice you can avoid it.\n-No info about weapons in the game, just named. Which is better, the axe or sledgehammer? How much strength till I'm not penalized for using it? What makes this hockey stick \"X-treme\" over the regular one? Beats me. Not going to sit in an empty room to test and do the math on randomized dmg, cooldown time, stamina use, and the impact 2 seperate stats have on it all.\n-Your AI squad guy might find a grenade early on. He might hold it for the entire game in his inventory lulling you into a false sense of security; just obediently holding it for you to use later. Then he will suddenly have the urge to throw it at a zombie 1 foot away on the last level, killing your entire team in one shot even though you were fully decked out in some great gear.

The brainless corpses are being featured in more and more games, to the point where there isn't much freshness left. So... does this Death Road to Canada manage to bring a new spin on the walking dead? Surprisingly, yes. \n\nThe playstyle is nothing new and will be imediately fammiliar to every Oregon Trail (and Organ Trail) fan. You control a group of survivers on their way to Canada, where everything is better... well at least people aren't being eaten alive (and even if they are - free healthcare!) The story is not that complicated and very barebone. All you have to know is that the world is populated by zombies and that Canada is 15 driving days away. \n\nYou start out with two survivers, which you can freely customize. There is quite a lot of different options and everybody can make something to suit their needs. If you're feeling up to it, you can also try rare character mode, where most of the companions you encounter are replaced with people with all sort of special abilities. I'm 8 hours into the game and I'm still often running into new companions, so there is quite a decent variety there. Once you've selected the options you like, you can hit start and be off on your journey.\n\nEvery character has different attributes, which aren't visible imediately. Instead, you discover them over time by performing different tasks that require that perticular skill. Another thing you have to keep track of are supplies. You have to gather food, fuel, meds and three types of ammo. If you run out of any of the first two, you're basicly screwed since morale also plays a big part in the game.\n\nThere are two parts to the game. The first one is presented by different encounters, where you get to pick what you want to do in a specific situation. Attributes play a huge rule here, as they can be the difference between loosing half of your supplies and beating the bandits in a flexing competition. There are quite a lot of different random events and while you can evade sometimes prevent the negative outcome, this isn't always the case. This means you can sometimes loose a big hunk of supplies (expecialy if you run out of fuel) and even members of the group, which can get quite annoying. Sure, a bit of randomness is welcome, however to much of it can make you feel salty when everything goes to hell.\n\nThe second part of the game consists of exploring of areas, populated by zombies. These include different types of missions, such as sieges and scavenging missions, to name a few. They get harder and harder over time and the same holds for the number of zombies, which can sometimes reach over 100 corpses at a time. This means that sometimes it's better to avoid them instead of trying to kill them, since they just keep on coming. Fortunately, there is quite a lot of different weapons and this does help to keep things interesting. \n\nFrom the graphics standpoint, the game looks decent but nothing special. The pixelated graphics do help it run smoothly even on older systems and integrated graphic cards, which is a big plus if your computer is a bit outdated. \nAnother thing I'd point out is the soundtrack. Some of the reviewers stated that they got annoyed by it after a couple of hours, but I'm still loving it - It just fits so well. \n\nConclusion:\nInitialy, I've had a bit of a hard time deciding wheather I should recommend Death Road to Canada or not. Mostly because it isn't that cheap (you could argue 15$ is cheap) and there is a lot of randomness that can often screw you over. In the end however, I've decided to put my recommendation on it. I've had quite a lot of fun playing and every run I made seemed unique. While I still haven't managed to finish the game on normal mode, I've still had my share of fun. You know what they say - Sometimes the journey is more important than the destination. \n\nFinal Rating: 7.8/10", "timestamp_created": 1470870044, "timestamp_updated": 1470871283, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.738443", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24809401": {"recommendationid": "24809401", "author": {"steamid": "76561198128792775", "num_games_owned": 276, "num_reviews": 66, "playtime_forever": 1565, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506646917}, "language": "english", "review": "dab on em", "timestamp_created": 1470832675, "timestamp_updated": 1470832675, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24802894": {"recommendationid": "24802894", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081996068", "num_games_owned": 73, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 317, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472942765}, "language": "english", "review": "So I started up a game with a guy named Oswoldo and another named Wrektangle. It starts off fine, and everything seems to be working out. Until they reach a bandit check point, so I sent oswoldo to convince them to let us go through... But Oswoldo turns out to be a total DICK and joins the bandits ditching Wrektangle. Wrektangle drives ahead for a little while and it was smooth sailing but then he ran into an NPC named Clown. The logical course of action was for Wrektangle to let him in the car... you know the sensible thing to do. From then on Clown seemed to just be a little bit wierd until about 8 days till Canada. They sit down in an abondoned building in some infested city Wrektangle happed upon some rare loot, a nice suprise after wasting 2 hours trying find keys to an ice cream truck. Clown then whips out a music box and starts playing circus music. Wrektangle goes to yell at him but Clown is gone without a trace. Then as the music is still playing a massive hoard of zomies storm into the building and Wrektangle goes down in a blaze of glory...

This game strips down all of the slower moving aspects of zombie survival into a concise and streamlined re-playable experience. \n\n   The player controls randomly generated or self-generated characters on a romp from Florida to Canada in hopes to find safe haven. Along the way, resources must be scavenged, zombies must be crushed, allies need to be rescued or recruited, and hope to god the car doesn\u2019t break down along the way.\n\nStrengths:\n\u2022\tThe gameplay is just pure fun. Fast and Frantic with a bit of strategic maneuvering required when things get really hairy.\n\u2022\tThe RPG elements bring personality to each of the characters, and each specialization feels powerful enough to warrant a diverse group of zombie survivors. Just be sure to keep everyone as happy as possible or they might leave at the worst possible moment!\n\u2022\tThe random events are both funny and enjoyable, with a bit of rage inducing as well to keep things nice and balanced towards a harder difficulty.\n\u2022\tLocal co-op makes for a great addition, but what is even better, playing alone is just as fun. The AI allies are not just mindless drones, they will loot, replace their weapons and crack zombie skulls with precision.\n\u2022\tThe production values are extremely high, visuals are top notch, music is fantastic, and the UX is streamlined and easy to navigate and use. The game also tends to throw useful events your way if you happen to be SOL in a particular resource.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\u2022\tThe lack of an online or four player option makes me a sad panda.\n\u2022\tThe pendulum of \u201cDoing Well\u201d to \u201cDead Meat\u201d can swing extremely quickly. One moment you are doing fine, and the next day you are left with nothing because the car broke down.\n\nOverall Death Road to Canada is the survival game I didn\u2019t even know I needed in my life. Sometimes after playing hundreds of hours in Project Zomboid or State of Decay, it is nice to just have a bit of fun smashing zombies, collecting loots, and driving towards the Maple Leaf State. I see myself playing this game for months in hopes to unlock all of the different modes and characters, easily the best fifteen dollars spent in a long while.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBBpEq0-czo&feature=youtu.be", "timestamp_created": 1470635382, "timestamp_updated": 1470635382, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.564559", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24771691": {"recommendationid": "24771691", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041645522", "num_games_owned": 63, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 828, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485041568}, "language": "english", "review": ">make perfect combo\n>find best bodybuilder in the world, T*L*B\n>continue driving until 3 days left\n>portal in road\n>throw T*L*B in\n>becomes B*L*T\n\n\u1559/10 would have a muscle man become a sandwich again", "timestamp_created": 1470633058, "timestamp_updated": 1470633058, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503275", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24770757": {"recommendationid": "24770757", "author": {"steamid": "76561198152580663", "num_games_owned": 43, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 11096, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 55, "last_played": 1514151709}, "language": "english", "review": "This game will make you laugh and cry. \nIt's like Oregon trail but with zombies and humor. \nFirst few tries, you don't mind dying but after that you just want to finish so when you do it feels amazing.\nPretty dificult sometimes even with the, \"Rare Characters\" mode which makes it easier to find unusual but powerful characters.\nMake tough choices.\nTell people to, \"COOL IT\"\nTell people to, \"SAY IT DON'T SPRAY IT\"\nInteresting dialogue.\nDogs.\nA Gnome riding a rat.\nRob friendly traders because you need supplies.\nLeave your team members in a horde of zombies so they can probably unwillingly sacrifice themselves for you\nTell traders that, \"Anime isn't real\" until you stumble upon an anime girl that shoots hearts from a magical wand up until she explodes from becoming increasing kawaii.\nGet angry when your team mates swap out their good weapons that you gave them for random shit weapons.\nBe disheartened when you realize you'll have a hard and frustrating time completing the game because there's only two guides on steam relating to the game.\nG E T  P U M P E D  U P.\nGrunt with internal rage when one of your chracters throws a molotov or some kind of bomb and it kill one of your team.\n(I'd recommend just staying away from molotovs altogether)\nSurprising amount of character creation customization.\nCreate your family and friends only to have them die in glorious zombie combat because they have shitty fitness and strength stats.\nLaugh with glee as you get amazing lucky events such as finding toilet paper.\nGlance nervously at the clock during a siege because you've been backed into a corner and you're desperate for a way out of the mess you got yourself into.\nFeel obligated to play this game until you make it to goddamned Canada.\nHave a party member named Canada so certain dialogue is funny.\nGet killed by stupid things like climbing a tree and team mates turning out to be STUPID FUCKING TRASH.\nGet attacked by bees.\nGet attacked by feral dogs.\nGet attacked by bears.\nGet attacked by meese.\nGet attacked by feral cats.\n\nI found this game really enjoyable for the time that I played it, which wasn't really 45 hours, I just happened to leave my PC on overnight a few times with the game open.

It's got the classic decision-making sort of thing for survival games \u2013 you know, the whole point-and-click thing, \"Should we try to help that guy or let him die?\" sorta thing \u2013\u00a0and you also have to run around hordes of zombies to grab resources that you'd die without. And let it be known that this is actually quite a difficult game. I've been playing this for a decent amount of time and I have still not beaten it (I got so close to beating it then died when there was one day of driving left. ONE DAY!!!). It's also got a lot of really funny references in it. There's a rare character called \"DSYP\" which is a pretty funny reference to the game, \"Don't Shit Your Pants,\" there's a super \"kawaii-desu-desu\" anime character that shoots magical star beams from her wand, honestly just great. Some of the stuff the characters will say and do are also pretty funny. I also bursted out laughing when I realized that I could play as a dog when all the other characters in my group died and the dog was able to operate and drive a car and could also walk around on its hind legs and hold weapons. My one and only complaint about this game is that the soundtrack gets annoying after a while but that's really not a big deal considering you can just turn off the music.\n\nTLDR; Really funny, enjoyable gameplay, you can actually play it multiplayer which is really neat, easy controls & appealing graphics.

Played quite a bit over a friends house.\n\nThe Good: The premise, characters, and setting are quirky (in a good way) and interesting.\n\nThe Bad: Almost everything else is underwhelming.\n\nSome have compared this to the Oregon Trail. That comparison does not work in this game's favor because it has fewer features than an educational game that didn't have a lot of features in the first place. In Oregon Trail you can set your pace. In Death Road to Canada your pace is dependent on what car you have and what car you have is dependent on RNG. In Oregon Trail you can make major decisions on what path to take. In Death Road to Canada your decisions are limited to \u201cDo you go to the bar or go to the old safe house\u201d. In Oregon Trail you can set your rations, choose where you want to rest, and make a profit off trading. In Death Road to Canada you can't set anything like that, where you can rest is dependent on RNG, and most of the trading is worthless because obtaining items to even begin to have something to trade is RNG and there are few if any ways to profit off of trading.\n\nMost if not all of your characters stats will be hidden until revealed. Revealing them requires making the character perform a certain action. If their stat is bad they will fail wasting your time and possibility costing you something,\n\nMuch of the game is spent scavenging or fighting zombies. The problem is combat is both bare bones and tedious. You will be using melee weapons most of the time because they are the easiest to find. Aside from weapons like the chainsaw they lack any interesting differences other than things like \u201cX does slightly more damage than Y\u201d. Guns (if you find them or enough ammo to make them useful) suffer from the same affliction.\n\nMelee combat consist of swinging, waiting to recovering and doing the same thing again. Swing too much and your character will momentary get tired indicated by them sweating. Combine this with uninteresting weapons, uninteresting environments, and one note foes and the tedium really starts to set in especially during sieges.\n\nAt times (especially near the end of the game) you will be required to face sieges. During such sieges you are trapped in a building with zombies coming through the floor/ceiling and you are required to hold them off until they stop spawning. After that you have to exit through a small doorway which will usually be blocked by a good amount of zombies until you can clear enough to run past them. \n\nSome may find this game difficult. My recommendation is to find a better game with a more interesting combat system or features in general. This game is not worth gitting gud at.

This game farts in the car and then blames it on the biscuit.\n\nThis game has Elvis, Mass Murderers, Dogs and Cats living together, mass hysteria, familiar faces, valkyries with magitech hammers that already know you're going to take them along for the ride, and any number of things that can, will, and possibly shouldn't but do happen. I'm pretty sure there's a goddamn alien in this game somewhere too!\n\nOkay, random amazed waffling aside, I dare you to try and find a funnier, more charming, more fun, oregon trail parody. Great gameplay, charming visuals, amazing customisation of characters, quirky, silly fun music (it might grate a little now and then but it's harmless in its silliness so it gets a pass on that and it changes often enough to not be too irritating), wonderful random events, dogs that can drive cars and fire guns, cats that are huge and potentially can help you out too I guess, random personalities, random cars, and zombie sieges which may or may not end with you having to use your dead buddy's body as a way to distract the massive horde of zombies so you can try to escape, only to die to a bee stinging you in the car when you're all alone.\n\nIt may also get you to Canada safe and sound. That to me sounds like a totally awesome reason to get this game.

Event pops up demanding I remove 1 character as they are not pulling their weight... yes, very fair.\n\nI've died mostly in thanks to the RNG events that have crippled my team, supplies, stolen all food, broke my car, etc etc. \n\nFrom my experience 70% of the events are out to ruin something for you, and will. Another example, I found a stack 31 of Gas while exploring which is rare since you find no more than 4 pieces in 1 exploration area on average. The very next moment the RNG even of \"Bandit humanoid demands all your gas\" \n\nYou see, that's not fun, all you're doing is stripping away the hard fought items the players have worked to strip from the cold dead hands of zombies and other carcasses. The mechanics of some of the events can be steered with specific skills for people, but since you can't check your members skills and most the people on your team have their skills hidden, it makes it an awesome russian RNG roulette.\n\nThe scavanging/exploring part of the game is challenging later on but a lot of fun. if you get cornered and eaten to pieces 9 times out of 10 it's your fault. Finding what you need to do to tackle the next area is a lot of the fun, but I have trouble recommending this game, as you spend 20 minutes pulling off some amazing survival stunt... Only to have the contents you came back with, ripped from you due to an \"event\" you have have little control over. \n\nIf there weren't so many I wouldn't complain, but just knowing you're highly likely to lose somerthing 70% of the time doesn't make you want to continue playing.\n\nLast note, never go on foot.

You have some very tough decisions to make on you're journey to Canada that really effect the game and there are also some sections that have action oriented gameplay and zombies all over the place, the game can get brutal!\n\nDon't let the cute, old school pixel style graphics fool you, it is very challenging and will keep you on you're toes at all times. The dialogue is well written, the game is very funny and random events are all very well done.\n\nYou have to manage you're group of people as you try and make it from Florida to Canada. Like Oregon Trail before it, you must manage many things, including fuel, weapons, guns and food. One aspect I love, that I mentioned above is some of the tough choices you have, which remind me of a good rpg. \n\nEach game has been very different so far and I can see a good amount of replay value to this game. Did I mention make you're decisions wisely? Sometimes things as small as letting someone join you're group, to going to find loot and losing one or all of you're group members.\n\nSometimes the vehicle will break down, if one of you're characters is a mechanic they can fix it, if you get jumped by bandits you must make the decision to pass over of you're hard each food/gas/ammo to the bandits or attack them. All of the random events and choices are very welll written to and alot of the time are very hard choices that take a little while to decide what you want to pick. \n\nYou will also have to pick weither to stop and check out some houses or stores along you're way, sure it would be nice to get some more food, ammo or gas but at what cost? You might get jumped by the zombies and it could all end there. Do you check out the city or keep driving and going to the next one? \n\nIf you have a friend or family member around you can also get them to hop in at times and control one of you're gorup members. One aspect I wish this game had was coop for people that are not in the same house. Local coop is cool but boy would this be fun with friends from other countries or cities. The other aspect I had some issues with was the crashes, I had 4 or 5 crashes during my many hours on the game. And lastly, the controls for keyboard and mouse could be improved, thankfully it handles flawless with a controller.\n\nStill the good far outweigh the bad as Death Road To Canada brings a wonderful new, zombie style take on the Oregon Trail formula and does most of it very very well. The writing is top notch, the game has a ton of charm, the gameplay is fun, you have tough choices to make and it has good replay value.  This is a game that I find really good for an hour at a time and I can see myself playing much more over the next year. A few minor issues didn't take away from  the enjoyment I had while playing this game. Each time you restart it feels like a new experience, interested to see what new things the developers add in the future. \n\nGet ready for a hell of a ride with Death Road To Canada! Oh yeah, one last thing, never let a clown in you're vehicle if you see one on the side of the road!\n\n**I got a copy of this game to review from the developers.

The first being a horrible UI and control scheme.  Trying to use firearms is difficult at best because it tries to control like a twin-stick, but you can't map controls for that properly.  The other major issue is the random nature of things leaves you in constant situations where you just can't win.  A seige with a bad map or a series of bad encounters and you just have to restart.  Though I appreciate rouge-likes for what they are, this one just seems to fall into a habit of screwing over the player as much as possible.  The ability to make custom characters is a nice feature, it lets you fine tune a pair of characters and can make things more enjoyable.  I feel that this game falls into the trap that many rouge-likes seem to of a lack of information as a difficulty setting.  Yes, part of that style game is not necessarily knowing what the item you just picked up does and having to learn it, but this game takes that to extremes by not knowing your character stats or abilities picking up weapons that have no durability rating or any stats at all.  A lack of information to make a decision is not a good way to set difficulties, it is just frustrating.\n\nI saw this played on Youtube and it looked fun.  And though I enjoyed it for a few run throughs and dealt with the frustrations for a while, really after 30 minutes you're just repeating the same frustrations over and over.

The game would also be considered to be a randomly generated zombie killing machine. The aim of the game is to lead you and acquaintances you meet along the way from Florida to Canada. This is because you have heard that Canada has been spared from the zombie apocalypse. However, as they say its the journey and not the destination that is the aim of the game.\n\n[h1]Before I Begin[/h1]\n\nI have had a great time reading many of the reviews that have been contributed to Steam. This is the perfect game for sharing individual experiences. As a result, I can see fan fiction becoming an enormous part of the game's community. Therefore, kudos for this not only goes to the community members for creating this wonderful content but also to the developers for designing a game perfect and worthy of it. It is truly a testimony to the quality of the final product.\n\n[h1]Learn As You Go[/h1]\n\nThe tutorial teaches you the bare minimum. For some this may be a concern but it shouldn't be. I have found that some of the best games only teach the basic mechanics needed to play. The rest is left to the player experience. If you put the time into the game you will continue to learn each time you play. This is a very good thing. This is because some of the tricks I have learned wouldn't have meant as much had they been in the tutorial and had I not learned them by myself. Some of the magic of the playing is in the learning. Therefore, the game demands that you learn more as you progress. Consequently, you may die a few times but you need to mark these down as learning experiences.\n\n[h1]Challenging...[/h1]\n\nTo continue with the 'learning as you go' mantra of the game it must be acknowledged that it is very challenging. For starters, the zombie AI - as stupid as zombies may seem - can be quite tough. They can swarm and they can, and will, overwhelm you. Therefore you must remain alert and vigilant at all times. You must consider if you are outnumbered and if so what your best avenue of self defense and preservation is.\n\nWeapons can and do break. You will run out of ammunition. However, you can hold multiple weapons at any one time. It is best policy to remember the strengths and weaknesses of your characters. This is most noteworthy because the weapons that you choose to wield - when you find them - can make the game easier. There's nothing better than having the ability to go to town against a swarm and defeating them all.\n\nIf there is one potential weakness of the game its in the fact that the difficulty can spike unpredictably. However, there is a valid argument that this adds realism to the game. There is never going to be any scenario that is exactly as it seems. Swarms can occur at random intervals. As a result of this randomness some of these spikes can lead to frustrating deaths.\n\n[h1]... To the point of being Unforgiving[/h1]\n\nGenerally, the game is unforgiving. Once you screw up there is very little chance for your survival. As a result of this the game is definitely one that has the potential to induce rage. An example of this rage came in my second unsuccessful attempt. I had successfully cleared a building and wanted to move on with the game. Therefore, I raced outside with my trio of seemingly hardened warriors into a swarm of the undead. I jumped in my car but of course I couldn't drive away because the vehicle was swarmed. They not only damaged the vehicle but proceeded to annihilate all of us. I could do nothing but watch in sheer terror.\n\n[h1]Randomly Generated Adventuring[/h1]\n\nOne of the best features of the game is the way in which it is randomly generated. Stories and settings for individual segments of the game are randomly generated. However, they are based somewhat from the options you are provided with.\n\nIn one of my segments I visited a city and was given the choice of whether or not I wanted to visit a sports store or a house with a HELP sign. As this was early on in the game and I was only with my initial buddy I chose to go to the HELP house. I took my chances that the house would have somebody still alive that would be willing to join my team. Although I bet the sports store probably had a nicer selection of weapons and equipment that I could pick up. This strategy was of the hope that the numbers game would help more than a randomized weapon. I was proven to be correct. I acquired the extra party member and was able to adventure on.\n\nIn conclusion, the events are random. This is especially relevant considering the entirety of the game is played out within these little settings. However, it leads me to the next segment of the game that is worth noting and that is the game's buddy system.\n\n[h1]The Buddy System[/h1]\n\nThis is one of my favorite features in the game. Hidden within the fun thrilled violence is a message about camraderie and the meaning of taking a road trip together. You have a choice at the beginning of the game whether or not you want to start with an ally. I would suggest that if you are a beginner that you do have one. If you have a second player with you then they can play the role. If not, then the computer will control them for you. Because the game has been well designed the AI does a reasonable job hacking enemies up for you.\n\nEach ally comes with their own unique characteristics and skills that can add value to your team. Although beggars can rarely be choosers you may want to consider what type of characters you align yourself with. They can stay with you until they either die or they betray you. That's right, they can betray you. That in itself is a fascinating mechanic. If they do betray you then its game over. It's best to keep their morale high - through successful completion of events and stories - although I am uncertain as to whether or not this increases the likelihood of betrayal. I assume that it would.\n\n[h1]Custom Characters[/h1]\n\nA great feature of the game is that you can create a number of custom characters. You can choose to play this character and/or have one as your buddy. If you choose not to do this then they can and will pop up throughout the game. It is at this turn that you can add them as allies.\n\n[h1]Risk/Reward and Resource Management[/h1]\n\nThere is a risk/reward system at play in the combination of stories/events and allies. Events will pop up throughout the game that provide you with an opportunity to utilize their abilities. If they are successful then you can increase your stockpile sometimes dramatically. However, failure in any of these events can see a crucial member of your unit die. As a result you will need to carefully consider the strengths and weaknesses of your character, your current predicament and determine whether or not the potential reward is worth it. Given the unforgiving nature of the game each decision is significant.\n\nWith that said an underappreciated part of the game is in its resource management. Players must consider how many rations, medical supplies, fuel, etc. that they have at their disposal. Players must therefore weigh up the pros and cons of adding an ally. If you are running dangerously low on resources then adding a member to your team may not be the most sage of things to do.\n\nAs a result of the total combined randomness you are guaranteed a unique playthrough every time you play.", "timestamp_created": 1470032353, "timestamp_updated": 1470032353, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 52, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.821296", "comment_count": "8", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24645174": {"recommendationid": "24645174", "author": {"steamid": "76561198102727095", "num_games_owned": 253, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 1469, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486253056}, "language": "english", "review": "Its fun and challenging.

There are also lots of little touches here and there (like the varied font types or the special characters) that really make this game so much more then just the sum of it's parts.\n\nFinally, I can't close this review without talking about the devs. These guys are amazing.

Nothing vulgar or dark. Biggest insult you'll encounter in this game is Dingus (and even that is not an insult :p).\nThere's almost not a single conversation in-game that didn't give me a little smile. \nCombat, and the whole game itself, is simple, minimalistic, non complex at all and still manages to be so addictive and amazing.\nToday many games advertise on \"randomly generated\" marketing, but not as many manage to execute the mechanic well. Death Road to Canada is not bragging about it, yet it has one of the most impressive randomization mechanics I've ever seen in games.\nWhen I said it has resemblance to FTL, it's not just about its replayability, but also the perfectly short campaign.\nGames with replay value should be exactly like that. Short and interesting, and not have 1000s of hours per playthrough. My shortest (successful) playthorugh on normal difficulty was approximately 1.5 hours. I am yet to do the longer campaign mode, but am already eager to try it out after countless amounts of fails.\nAnd speaking of fails, unlike many other rouge-like games, this one does not make you want to smash your keyboard againt the display when you lose. i can't quite explain why. Maybe it's the games general poistivity vibe, maybe it's because things lost are not so hard to gain. Maybe both.\nAnd finally for someone like myself who is absolutely into retro games, this one will grab nostalgia by its weakest point. Amazing pixel art combined with great 8-bit soundtrack is a perfect formula to satisfy all the gamers dating way back from times of NES/Sega consoles.\n\nOverall amazing. I have absolutely not a single complaint.\nIt's humorous, simple, minimalistic, beautiful and has got great replay value to it.\n\nPassing a game like this is like a sin for every self respective gamer, to say the least", "timestamp_created": 1469765629, "timestamp_updated": 1469765629, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502661", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24588798": {"recommendationid": "24588798", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003229310", "num_games_owned": 160, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 320, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470113602}, "language": "english", "review": "HAHAHA this is FTL but with zombies!

Its a nice twist on an old concept, I'd honestly say that it plays similar to faster than light, only instead of aliens you have to fight zombies. Death Road requires inventory and resource management, some on the fly environmental awareness and deciding whether or not you have the resources to recruit additional members to your group of happy, hopeful survivors. Speaking of recruitable members, you can come across a wide variety of survivors, ranging from your run of the mill pistol and crowbar toting survivor, to a Jason Vorhees lookalike and a magical anime girl, you can even recruit the occasional dog into your group. The game also has quite a few random encounters which can put your group members skills to the test. you may have to pass charisma or strenght checks or perhaps a more in depth shooting or medical skill check. The game has a quirky sense of humor that isn't for everyone, personally I find some of the jokes a little hit and miss. The game is a little pricey for what it is, with other indie titles of a similar style going for much less, would recommend waiting until Christmas or Summer when this will probably go on sale.\n\nPositives \n>Wide variety of weapons to choose from\n>Suprisingly good character customisation \n>Wide range of skills for your character \n>A decent assortment of vehicles to find and use in your trek to Canada \n>The randomly generated style of play can provide a decent challenge \n>The humor is pretty good in places \n>Soundtrack included in the game's files \n>A pixel art style that has had some effort put into it \n\nNegatives \n\n>For those who have grown tired of pixel art, this may not be for you\n>RNG can make the game punishingly difficult \n>Sometimes the game provides you with little supplies on the early stages, amplifying the difficulty later on\n>Zombie encounters are sometimes too few and far between, sometimes they occur too often\n>Priced a little high for what is essentially a rather basic game (Honestly, Hotline Miami cost less than this)\n\nFinally, I'll go on record by saying that this is perhaps the only game i've played so far where a character can be killed by stubbing their toe on a rock. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1469667285, "timestamp_updated": 1469667285, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24565927": {"recommendationid": "24565927", "author": {"steamid": "76561198138814039", "num_games_owned": 25, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 9256, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504811014}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing game!

Anything can happen, for example, have a lot of food? Well sorry you had a hole in your bag. Doing okay on health? Feral cats attack. The humor and randomness make this game feel unique.

So far the only bug I've seen is when you get through a tiny space and your teamates will make an entire circle around the object so that they can get to you, that got my teamates killed many, many times.\n\nOne of my best runs so far, was with a guy named Dik, I gave him Megabuff and Warrior and tried to make him look like a biker. He had basically become a zombie master, with almost all abilities maxed out. I was 1 day from Canada, had more than 60 food and died to a molotov I threw at a group of zombies during a siege. My dog was the only one left, and even though he survived the siege, I hadn't teached him to drive a car, so I ended up losing and starting over. But I couldn't be mad at the game, because it was my fault.\n\nNow, onto the pros and cons.\n\nPROS:\n+Randomly generated maps, survivors and personalities.\n+Random events (I once got my character possessed by a demon)\n+Zombies get more aggressive the more time you spend on a mission\n+YOU CAN THROW FURNITURE AROUND!\n+The game has a good sense of humour\n+Decent amout of skills and perks to choose from, and you can level up your skills\n+Teamates who are actually smart about weapon choice. For example, if your follower is using a melee weapon but gets tired and is carrying a ranged weapon, it will change to the ranged weapon until it has enough stamina back. It will also pick up weapons on the ground when it has none left.\n\nCONS:\n-Not many customization options, females get more than males\n-The follower's pathfinding sometimes bugs out\n-Sometimes if there's a weapon on the floor, your teamate will keep changing his weapons continuously until you move away from it\n-Only local co-op.\n\nAll in all, i'd give this game a solid 9/10.

I love it, and like listening to it outside of the game from time to time. You can also access it easily in the game files.\n\nThe graphics :\n\nI personally like a lot good pixel art, and this one is truly good ! I don't really know what i could add, plus you can easily see for yourself. Pixels done right.\n\nThe gameplay :\n\nMovements are fluid, there are a good choice of ways to deal with the zombies when it comes to the action part of the game, such as the classic melee weapons, pistols, shotguns, rifles. You can also sometimes manage to find molotovs, pipe bombs, grenades etc... Moreover, some characters have specific ways to (or not to!) deal with  zombies and get all that sweet loot.\nYour ai teammates, if you choose to take any with you during looting missions are good at following you around, managing their stamina (as in not killing non threatening zombies) and shouldnt die stupidly too often.\nThe only issues i've encountered yet are some with the depths, for example when you think a zombie is farther than you vertically than it really is, and also sometimes walls \"hitboxes\" taking melee hits instead of zombies.\n\nIn the other part of the game, wich is managing your road trip across zombinated states toward canada, you are faced with events and a couple of choices. Theses can range to bandit attacks, zombie sieges, picking your looting location, recruiting or not the random survivors you come across along the road, and much more.\nThis is in my opinion the hardest part of the game, as i've lost more good men to bandits and unfortunate events than zombies, but it's not frustrating at all. You can generally move along without too much damage if your group doesnt have someone able to deal with the situation, and it generally rewards good thinking, instead of having randomly generated outcomes which you don't have control of. To summarize, choices are not always easy, but it's not frustrating either.\n\nThere is also a possibility of local coop, but having not tested it I cannot say if it's good or bad, though I'd say having that possibility is a nice plus !\n\nReplayability :\n\nI absolutely guarantee you won't see everyting there is to see in your first playthrough. You most likely won't win it either. There is a lot of elements, characters, items and events to discover, and also a few gamemodes available from the start. Custom characters are a nice addition, and the perks available are progressively upgraded as you play the game. Don't think they are useless from the start either.\nI have yet to play the game more, but at roughly 5 hours of play I did not get bored of it for a second, so I'd say the game does have a lot of hours of fun ahead for you.\n\nOverall one of the most fun \"little\" games i've played in a long time.

The mixture of the action gameplay along with the Oregon Trial like strategy gameplay works together rather well: as both end up enhancing the gameplay and choices of the other. And like a good roguelike: it's difficult, but manageable, forcing you to make difficult decisions that's not just there for show. It's the risk and reward mechanics that shine here: really rewarding you in pushing as far as your team can go without breaking, but punishing you heavily if you push too far. \nSure, you're going to struggle with some of the controls at first. But these are the right kind of \u201cinaccurate\u201d controls: controls that complement the gameplay in question. The only major problem I have with the game is the crashes (which is being addressed by the developer), and the AI can be REALLY dumb at times, getting itself killed rather easily. But if you like anything in the roguelike genre mixed with action, you'd be doing yourself a disservice by not picking up Death Road To Canada. It'll probably be on my \u201cunderrated games of the year\u201d list, as it's not going to get the mainstream attention that it should. But you should give it your attention. \n\n[b]Video Review: [/b]  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIYZRNZ-G0\n\n[u] Lists: [/u]\n[b]Positives:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Keeps the pressure on. Once you get past the first few days, you're feeling every battle. Resources are a godsend, and you'll never feel comfortable. \n[*] A great example of a good risk/reward system. Pushing your team to its edge in getting resources before the night comes, but pushing too far will usually hurt your team and maybe get it killed. \n[*] Smart decision making is rewarded. Understanding your teams strengths, and what option to choose based on it, will result in the appropriate outcome 90% of the time. There's just enough RNG added here to make things interesting, without making you feel like you're not in control. \n[*] Morale system in particular is actually implemented with some thought put behind it, and makes a difference when trying to go further and further. \n[*] You'll have to make hard decisions. Actual hard decisions. Not decisions that actually don't mean jack shit in the end. Like \u201cChoose between these two characters. One goes away.\u201d \n[*] Combat may be simple, but it's effective. It's about space management, and forces the player to think about how they can escape a room without losing anyone. It may be repetitive: but it's the good kind of repetitive. It's more about strategy and smart decisions made. \n[*] Some nice alternate weaponry that serves a specific purpose, like the cardboard tube. This gives you more reasons to vary up your arsenal. \n[*] Use of the environment is rewarded. Walking into a room with 50 zombies, only to yell \u201cNOPE\u201d and close the door behind you actually rewards you if you can get out without them noticing. Forcing enemies to bite through furniture can give you the space you need in order to deal with hordes.  \n[*] I like the control set for the most part here, even if it can be unwieldy at times. The thing is, it complements the combat and the tone that the gameplay is going for. You're not supposed to be a super Walking Dead gunslinger. You're just bob from the local diner. It will actually take some time and experience in order to actually be a bad ass.\n[*] It's always fun to run across the different popular media and video game characters in the world they've created here. Adding Octodad to the team? Yeah, I dig it. \n[*] It's that goofy kind of realism. There's feral cats, Zombies, aliens, and gators you wrestle. And yet, for some reason, you think this is reasonable given the universe, and can see it happen. Oh, and the whole Octodad thing. \n[/list]\n\n[b]Negatives:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] As of right now, I've had several crashes, but the developer is diligently working to solve the problems in question. Note that Windows 10 users may need to be weary of it.\n[*] Your AI partners can be.....very very dumb. Walking into zombies without any thought process what so ever if you get even the least bit separated. \n[*] Wanted to see a button dedicated to switch characters. Would have made things a lot smoother in terms of using that feature. \n[*] Some of the randomness of the weapon degradation can be annyoing, because you really don't know what some of your weapons conditions are. \n[*] The visual style just doesn't help the game out in the end. It's got a lot of customization and elements that would be taken to the next level if it had the visual elements behind it. \n[/list]\n", "timestamp_created": 1469545247, "timestamp_updated": 1469545247, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.576136", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24538150": {"recommendationid": "24538150", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989365367", "num_games_owned": 658, "num_reviews": 67, "playtime_forever": 2372, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504367010}, "language": "english", "review": "FTL meets Oregon Trail meets Nuclear Throne(ish?).

Pretty much every time I get to the last day I've been stopped by an overwhelmingly huge siege of zombies in a tiny room, and my team dies pretty quickly afterwards. Not sure if the final massive wave is a set event or if I'm just unlucky, since my sample size is admittedly pretty small.

Basically Oregon Trails with zombies and a healthy (And heavy) dose of humor that suddenly pops up in the strangest places. Just to give you an example of this seriously hard but enjoyable game, I'll just mention my best run yet. \nStart off with two of my own characters, quickly recruited two more, and raided multiple places including buttville's police department. \nThen a rather hard siege came. I lost one; an annoying woman who was always tlaking about getting swole who bore copper goggles and a pink mohawk. But she died. Then, we went and found some traders- it was actually just a talking, standing dog selling ammunition, very casually. After him, we went and raided a collapsed Y'all mart... and we lost two of our people in a vain attempt to loot sugar cakes and cans of nodescript meat. \nAnd eventually, after crashing a car over a fissure in the ground and stealing an exterminator's van (Complete with giant plastic ant on the roof), I met Horse. \nMajestic, fast, valiant... and completely fucking insane. Basically, he was a completely naked man who would just neigh, wore a horse mask, and ran twice as fast as other characters. And low and behold, he would become the hero of this story. \nThe last remaining survivor of my original group eventually diedin yet another siege, and for a long time, Horse marched on alone; charing through salvagable areas without even killing a single zombie because he could not swing a weapon. (For those are not arms, but his \"Forelegs\"!) But due to some loophole the devs missed, he could shoot a gun and he became wonderous with that shotgun of his. \nSoon, I went and rescued a big fluffy white dog that took to Horse, and for nearly five days it was those two, riding on in several more cars (One which Horse managed to fix), having highly intelligent conversations between their barks and neighs. \nEventually, the dog died in a sewer, trying to protect her equine partner. The dog and the horse- a partnership that wasn't destined to last! But Horse eventually found another companion, a bright purple haired woman with a big pistol that did much of the talking for those last few days. \nAnd then Canada, our last objective, came into view. Three sieges happened before, though... and good gods, fear those sieges. Especially when you're Horse. \nMy purple-haired companion perished halfway into the first one (Her pistol was big, but not big enough). Horse survived the second without barely a scratch, running in circles for two hours in game time to avoid the zombies. \nBut the final siege was twice as strong, and, two miles (I think) from his goal, Horse died as he had lived, running endlessly. \n\nThis is a wonderful, brilliant game that holds plenty of surprises.

The combat isn't revolutionary but it feels good and there is more than one way to come at the zombies and it allows you the player some flexibility in your choice, something rare for a \"indie zombie\" game which typically are just cash grabs. The game is also brutal. Like unbelievably unforgiving when it comes to mistakes and just plain old random encounters. You might get have a full health team and then get 3 \"lose health\" random events in a row and have everyone die. It's not frustrating at least for me as the game is definitely designed for multiple play throughs and constant restarting. Though I would definitely not suggest this game to anyone who isn't of the mindset of \"losing is fun\".\n\nThere is a lot of great humor in the game as well as tons of easter eggs and pop culture references.  The events will probably begin to get repetitive at some point, but I certainly haven\u2019t reached that point yet. You are also given extensive customization of your character as well as the ability to have a \"folder\" of custom characters you can meet throughout the game in addition to the ones already in.\n\nThe music is hilariously (in a good way) out of place, but it's still very well made and catchy. And even though I say it\u2019s out of place it's by no way \"awkward\" it's just not what you would expect, but it still works. The pixel art is beautifully retro and the game also has a old western movie film grain over it (which you can disable if you'd like).\n\nFor things I didn't like, the controls felt atrocious for me, I just couldn't play with them. You are allowed to rebind and there is controller support, which is what I found was the best way to play. The options menu is also pretty barebones, only allowing you to change from full screen and windowed (which was stuck at one resolution) and adjusting the volume levels. I also found myself trying to move in certain locations only to find it was blocked by an invisible wall, but that was minor and probably a result of the \"top down\" view. \n\nOverall though, definitely a worthy purchase for only $15. A cute little indie zombie game with a great sense of humor, a hefty amount of content and a clear amount of love in the mix as well.", "timestamp_created": 1469471332, "timestamp_updated": 1469471332, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24522844": {"recommendationid": "24522844", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071272028", "num_games_owned": 161, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 497, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497826058}, "language": "english", "review": "- got my custom guy\n- gone solo\n-went to wall mart \n- killed 70 zombies and found lots if supplies \n- found a dog \n- dog is now my best friend \n- spent the road trip laughing and telling scary stories to my dog and loved each other\n- suddenly a bear came and killed my dog :(\n- my guy was really sad \n- out of the sky came thors gf and joins me \n- looted some stores \n- set up camp \n- bear came again and killed thors gf \n- in rage Of all I lost I went into an abandoned warehouse and thought through 100s and 100s of zombies with my trusty shotgun\n- got cornered about 50 zombies closing into me\n-I had several flash backs of my dog and thors gf\n- I accepted my fate as I ran out of ammo \n- I died and lived a sad but wonderful life \n- 10/10 made me cry :( rip dog and thors gf.", "timestamp_created": 1469470808, "timestamp_updated": 1469470808, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497203", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24522537": {"recommendationid": "24522537", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053978071", "num_games_owned": 56, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 440, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504676261}, "language": "spanish", "review": "gran juego indie, una propuesta arriesgada , juego dificil , con buena dificultad, apenas llevo 90 minutos y he muerto varias veces  con la situaciones mas idiotas posibles.\nsi buscas un juego para pasar el rato, con increibles carcajadas(imagina un chihuaha disparando con una shotgun)\n", "timestamp_created": 1469469640, "timestamp_updated": 1469469640, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.578947", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24519580": {"recommendationid": "24519580", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991517566", "num_games_owned": 387, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 958, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498256115}, "language": "english", "review": "A few gameplays under my belt and I start up with a pshyco and a rugged army guy who's a \"Mechanic\".

This is more of a frenzied sprint rather than The Organ Trail's marathon - instead of distance, you have 15 days of driving from Florida to Canada. You need gas, food, and whatever you can get your hands on. Good luck, godspeed, try not to die.\n\nExploring points of interest makes up a majority of the gameplay and is very action oriented. You can choose who goes out, and then the scavenging party goes of to a randomly generated SNES style action map level, very distinct from OT's EGA emulation. \n\nShooting zombies was the main defense in OT. While that's an option here, there's a huge emphasis on melee, knocking down enemies, and mobility - running past zombies RE style is usually your best option when scavenging. You and your buddies can die out there, you do not immediately get sent back to safety OT style after zombie contact. It actually takes being cornered or prolonged zombie contact to die, though, hence the mobility emphasis.\n\nThe only real complaint I have is that some mechanics may be initially obtuse, though you will probably be okay with this if you are a fan of rogue-likes that do similar things. For example, stats are hidden until you use them, which can be quite frustrating if you make assumptions or are gambling wildly on skills. I can't really say it's a negative as it does become more apparent over time who is good at what, or if you just make custom characters, but beware if it's your first time out!\n\nIn summary: good gameplay that's more active and engaging. Lots of game modes, easy to get in and out of, quite funny, great music, and gives me an odd River City Ransom vibe when scavenging, especially with some ai partners or better yet a second local player along.\n\nFinal note:\nFor the love of god, if you find a man dressed as Garfield, DO NOT TAKE HIM ALONG.

I played local co-op with my wife and we both had a lot of fun! Very humorous [i]Oregon Trail[/i] style game blended with some hack-n-slash action, with a bit of randomness thrown in for good measure.\n\n[i]Essentially, you are managing a group as they try to go from Florida to Canada.[/i] You manage supplies such as fuel, food, and different melee weapons and guns. There are choose-your-own-path events that pop up frequently. You sometimes will die VERY quickly from a random event, but its all good. The storyline is created as you go, and seems really great with each run.\n\nDefinately one of the highlights in this game is the ability to create custom characters, and save them so they pop up on future runs. I play myself, and my wife plays her in-game self. We put our friends in there. We choose their skill sets and how they look. It really makes the 'story' aspect so much more great.\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n+Great blend of [i]Oregon Trail[/i] and hack-n-slash gameplay\n+Controller support makes this great to play from the couch\n+The humor is spot-on and makes for really funny storylines that definately feel very unique each time you play\n+The ability to create and save custom characters is [i]awesome[/i]\n+RPG-esque leveling up of skills really adds a layer of strategy\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n-The music is pretty good, but is a bit 'lite' or 'wonky' for the game (this is hard to describe)\n-I don't know if its just us, but the controller is a bit awkward in the menus (not during gameplay, though) - it feels like it is cutting out, but it is definately not a battery thing or connection since I checked\n-You will have a few random deaths that feel cheap, but really its all fun and gave us good laughs\n\n[b]Definately an outstanding local co-op game.[/b] It is still fun single-player, but shines when playing with a friend.

It's an absolutely fantastic game, and the devs have made it memorable and replayable.\n\nMusic and visuals are top-notch and the game has a lot of humour and personality. It seems simple at first with it's pixel art but the art itself has a charm of its own, especially when you see the varied characters you can meet (including some famous dudes). It's also super fun adding your own characters to it too. The music is both calming and exciting and never boring to listen to, and I absolutely recommend the soundtrack.\n\nThe game is a mix between choose your own adventure (CYOA) and a scavenging game. Each day it takes to get to Canada, you're given the ability to pick where you want to rest/loot and to choose what happens in a written scenario. The written scenarios are what makes this game shine more, because they are absolutely RIDICULOUS. They are so ridiculous it's hilarious, and I had fun every single time I attempted my trip to Canada. Furthermore, being able to control what you pick up in terms of loot is a nice touch, making it more interactive and up to players rather than up to RNG. However, that doesn't mean RNG isn't a factor, as towns and cities are randomly generated, as well as what you can pick up in town.\n\nIn the time I've played this game, I experienced no crashes, or any bugs or glitches to speak about. The devs are very on top of this game as well, releasing new DLC content with big updates named after anatomical parts (which I'm a big fan of). On top of fine tuning and polishing the game, each DLC update they release is FREE. That's pretty great coming from indie devs.\n\nThis game is one of the games I enjoyed playing in 2016, and into 2017. It's one of the games I remember fully enjoying then and now.

First off ive been playing this game for about 7 years now and every playthrough ive had of it was exellent. There is alot of variety when it comes to builds. There is the obvious Light/Dark or Grey option for the game but there is also Force user builds, Ranged builds, Pure combat focused guardian, etc. I find the combat to be enjoyable (In my opinion) since its tactical and you can really plan attacks and things of that sort. Take DA:0 for example. Its pretty much the same system. You can start with 3 beginning classes: Guardian (Combat focused), Sentinel (Better skill progression), and Consular (Force powers). You then later in the game get different set of prestige classes depending on your allignment. Now, lets get to the writing of the game. This game has one of the best stories I have ever seen. You'll see once you play it for yourself. The reason I prefer this game slightly over the first is just because I prefer the darker, philosophical, grey aspects of the atmosphere and story a bit better (Kotor 1 is also one of my favorite games). Anyways, this game presents the idea that Dark is not necessarily evil and Light isnt nessesary good and you really get to see the Flaws of both sides. For example, you play as the Jedi Exile, who was exiled from the Jedi order for rusing to war to protect innocents. The Jedi were lazy and waited to \"evaluate the threat\". The dialouge and voice acting in this game is absolutely fantastic (Especially Kreia). For this game, you dont even need to be a fan of Star Wars. A non Star Wars fan would look at this game and just play an RPG. However a Star Wars fan would look at this and play an amazing Star Wars RPG. The reason for this is because the game is set in an era wayyy before the Movies. One flaw however, would be the cut content presented this game. Obsidian (The developers) were rushed to release this game by lucasarts, resulting in them needing to cut out content for the game. Luckily, a group of community modders managed to get into the games files and restore alot of the content that was cut. You can find the mod on the steam workshop. Anyways, hurry up and buy the game!

Tired of those endless drudges through gore and misery only to wind up going from day to day rooting out tins of cold baked beans? Sick and tired of having to scavenge hundreds of planks to make fences for your little survivor camp? Hacked off at seeing the same identikit survivors which stories which all blend into each other and just make you reach for the booze?\n\n[b]Fret no longer, for I present the Happiest Zombie Apocalypse in America[/b]\n\nDeath Road to Canada is possibly one of the most lighthearted zombie murder games I've run into in a long while, ostensibly taking it's inspiration from the Organ Trail, and FTL, you're put in charge of two survivors, and a car. Your job, should you choose to accept it, is to drive to Canada, or to die trying. Hint, you're going to die a fair few times before you get there, but that's all part of the learning experience. You can either take some random survivors in a default game setting, or you can create your own survivors, be they friends or people you want to see turned into zombie chow, and set off with your own choice of team, with the intent of picking up more friends along the way.\n\nCombat is a little bit loose, but that's intended by design, you are after all, survivors, not trained soldiers, so you tend to waff your melee weapons in the general direction of whatever is closest to you, said weapons ranging from spatulas (no, no joke) right the way through to sledgehammers, hockeysticks, nailboards, and baseball bats. Then you've the proper shootybang stuff with revolvers, pistols, shotguns and so on. The stats of your survivor play a significant part in how many swings they'll get in before they become \"winded\", or in the case of firearms, just how accurate they're prone to be (shotguns you can get away with giving to anyone, other guns you'll want to be a bit more careful with).\n\n[H1]DRtC has strong DNA, with a lot of content and a strong level of depth involved[/H1]\n\nFor what could have been a fairly simple pick up and play game, there's a lot of statistical complexity under the hood, with weapons having their own \"drain\" on player stamina, weapons having their own fire rate, accuracy and spread, and vehicles having their own consumption rate, and durability. Characters too have their own personality traits and benefits, meaning that it's unlikely you'll run across two survivors that are exactly the same in a given playthrough, as a direct result, DRtC becomes a far stronger game than the Organ Trail and actually elevates itself up to the company of games like Death Skid Marks, which shares the same kind of irreverant humour and sense of fun about it.\n\nThis doesn't even touch on the fact there's pets you can bring into the team (Dogs and Cats, though as yet I've not been successful at grabbing either), there's choose your own adventure style events, though these are more simplistic than say, FTL, they are stat based in terms of the choices you get with differing chances of success, and depending on your survivors, you may get presented with different options from one playthrough to the next.\n\n[H1]Closing thoughts[/H1]\n\nDeath Road to Canada -could- have been a throwaway title, or something that would have been fun for a pick up and play but ultimately not something that would stand up to repeated scrutiny. I'm glad to report that this definitely is not the case, there's real longevity here, and there's a definite gem of a game here.

As is normal for any review I do, I do \"due dilligence\" on all games that go through Kickstarter, and I highlight such things because in the interests of being thorough, that's my job. \n\nOne of the reward tiers ($50) provided backers with a specific game unlock, allowing them to have the option of a kitten or puppy as a \"morale booster\" who would grow into a full team member over time, at the cost of an additional food drain. This would be something in the -longer term- I'd like to see added as purchasable DLC of some sort, as it would be nice to have the full game made \"content complete\", however, as I state above, because this game is predominantly a singleplayer experience, this isn't something that will affect players beyond their personal preference.\n\nThis element will be removed or revised as more information is made available.", "timestamp_created": 1469241989, "timestamp_updated": 1469242110, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502952", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24470140": {"recommendationid": "24470140", "author": {"steamid": "76561198130820070", "num_games_owned": 60, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1722, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489640287}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a sexy ass game, no more comments, just buy it !", "timestamp_created": 1469235198, "timestamp_updated": 1469235198, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.467874", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24469230": {"recommendationid": "24469230", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051617731", "num_games_owned": 87, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 277, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495214759}, "language": "english", "review": "Very fun game, amazing humor and a quirky style.

You like funny things? Buy this, yo.\"\n\nI've already spent several hours in the game, and am still far from getting bored with the game, there's so much to love.\n\n[b]The Story:[/b]\n\nVery Straightforward, your goal is to get from Canada, from the US (I want to say you start in Florida). However, like many things in life, the story's more about the journey, than the destination. You'll be creating your own story along the way, from choosing how to handle a roadside robbery, to kick certain members out of the group when they complain about the ride too much, to wether or not to give that seemingly pretty friendly dog a knife. \n\n[b]Gameplay:[/b]\n\nThe gameplay is fairly straightforward in Death Road. The game is perma-death, meaning once you lose a character, until you start another run they're gone for good.\n\nThere are a set of skills in the game that are rolled mostly randomly for all characters, from being able to repair your car to how you handle certain weapons. These stats come into play in a variety of different way throughout the game. \n\n Your character(s) have two three major types of weapons they can use. \n1) Melee weapons. Almost all melee weapons will make you tired after repeated use, which takes a few moments before you can really start swinging at the undead spooks again. Most Melee weapons will also break after a certain period of time.\n2) Guns. Totally rad. Guns are awesome in every way. Except they take from a preeeeeeeeetty limited supply of bullets. Some runs you're going to have next to no bullets, sometimes you'll have...no bullets. Later on you'll be gathering enough to reliably use them, but conserve ammo wisely.\n3) Throwables, from grenades to Molotovs, these help clear a massive wave of zombies. They can also hurt your friends. Found that out the hard way. \n\nYou're charged with fighting horde after horde of the Zombie menace, scavenging for much needed food, fuel, weapons, and ammo. Each character can only take 3 bites from a zombie before they turn into some new lunch meat, so zombies can fairly consistantly pose a large threat in big enough numbers. Getting swarmed and surrounded from all sides will mean almost certain death,\n\n[b]Music:[/b]\n\nAaaahhhhhhh the music is great in this game. It's an awesome contrast from the pretty bleak situation your characters find themselves in, and its actually really enjoyable to listen to while managing your inventory, and making important choices like who should get the first bite of that candy bar. \n\n[b]Extra Things Worth Mentioning:[/b]\n\nTwo major things stand out to me that I think are worth bringing up, the Humor and the Character Creator.\n\nThe Humor in Death Road is phenominal. Several moments in the game had me actually laughing out loud, atracting the unwanted attention of curious family members. One of my favorite examples of this is:\n\nOne of the events your party can experence is stopping by a campsite, and telling ghost stories to one another. However, in one of my runs, only a single character remained, but I saw the \"Tell ghost stories\" option was still there. Assuming it would act like I had more than one party memeber, I clicked it, and was pleasantly supprised by the special dialouge, where half-way through my character discovered he was telling his story to ghosts the entire time. \n\nThe Charactor Creator is also a huge pro in my book. You can create and save up to (roughly) 16 charactes. You can customize several things about these characters, from their looks, to their outlook on life. You can choose to take One or Two of these characters with you at the begining of the game, or instead chose to randomize your starting cast. You will rarely run into your characters you created when you encounter random people throughout the course of the game, making it a very special treat to run into that weird 12th grade teacher you chose to spend 15 minutes creating in a video game. \n\n\nAll in all I really, really loved the game, and highly suggest it to anyone interested in rougelikes, zombies, or even just fun in general. The game oozes quality, from the random times you'll find yourself bartering with dogs with guns to when you choose to end an argument by driving a car into a tree.", "timestamp_created": 1469202901,

Canada is Oregon Trail. That's all it is. It's a weird simplified Oregon Trail-esque game with modern comedy writing and wacky events in lieu of normal strategic planning and \"realistic\" events like injuries and diseases. Now, you may be thinking, \"Isn't this just Organ Trail? Why do we need multiple games for this one extremely niche market?\" First of all, why don't we need multiple games, second of all, what we've got here is a pretty solid game.\n\nThere are two phases to the game: traveling and the choices you make on the road, and scavenging for supplies on the open road. Traveling works the way any similar random game works, be it Oregon Trail or FTL or Convoy or whatever. You will find rest places or bandits or teammates on the open road, and decide who to barter with, what to trust, who to tell to COOL IT (from personal experience, there's basically never a reason to tell anyone to COOL IT, which is a shame). The scavenging, in my opinion, is where the real heart of the game lies. Here you are in full control, weaving past hordes of the undead and rummaging through any house you can find in search of food, gas, health, ammo, and the occasional weapon. Combat is a last resort, as ammo is limited and all weapons have a chance of breaking (the AI apparently did not get this memo, as it will move to smack any zombie that comes within smacking distance, even if all they have at their disposal is an old umbrella or a femur). House maps are generated from random rooms, whose floor plans defy the laws of known physics with rooms that overlap each other and lead to god knows where. It's silly. It takes getting used to.\n\nOf course, any game following in the old footsteps of good old \"terrible death is educational\" will stumble onto the same problems as its predecessors: everything is left to the whims of the RNG, and the RNG hates your stupid surviving face. If your team has high morale, whoops, here's an event that drops everyone's morale. Got a surplus of food? Be a shame if some bandits were to get in your way. What's that? You have a car with gas? What do you think this is, Daytona USA? Sometimes while you're driving, characters will just argue with each other and lower their morale. Having an RNG that doesn't basically cheat certainly isn't easy, but typically there's some kind of middle ground. Super Amazing Wagon Adventure erred on the side of \"too easy\", though primarily that was due to gameplay being more based on skill than luck. In Death Road To Canada, the skill-based sections are enjoyable, but the luck-based ones are just a reminder to properly lubricate before making your decision.\n\nI do have to give this game props where it's due: for a zombie game, it does a good job at making a proper zombie atmosphere. The zombies are many and travel in hordes, and there's a thick VHS film grain that covers the screen giving it a classic Romero graphic look. (And yes, it can be turned off.) The one real surprising outlier is the music, which for whatever reason is some arcadey honky-tonk that adds to the game's \"quirkiness\", and if that's the kinda word that makes your stomach crawl up your esophagus, you might as well look elsewhere. The whole game's about being quirky, from constant references to being \"swole\" to the ability to play as a car-driving dog. This here is the silly version of Organ Trail, that's the name it's made for itself and that's how I enjoy it. (I mean, enjoying is sort of a relative term. I enjoy it as long as the game allows me to enjoy it before throwing me into a ditch and stealing my shit.)\n\n\nBottom line: this game is a game of Russian Roulette at some twisted carnival with the biggest teddy bear if you last five rounds. It's a twelve inch novelty dildo, and it's made of cubes because this game has a quirky pixel art style. And if you're the kind of masochistic thrill seeker who's into that stuff, then this is a fine way to spend your evening.", "timestamp_created": 1469199824, "timestamp_updated": 1469199878, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503289", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24460072": {"recommendationid": "24460072", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000402623", "num_games_owned": 373, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 2425, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511624544}, "language": "english", "review": "Earthbound meets Double Dragon meets Oregon Trail.\nWonderfully hilarious.\n\n+Humor\n+Great soundtrack\n+Replayability\n+The combat\n\n-The combat\n\nI'll jump straight to the main point...\nYou spend a lot of time fighting in this game so the combat system is gonna make or break the game for you...

I've been waiting to play this game for a really long time, and so far it has lived up to my expectations. The gameplay is simple to pick up, but there is some strategy involved. The player has to strike a careful balance between avoiding zombies and looting quickly, but also killing enough zombies in a previous room so that the player doesn't get boxed into the next room. \n\nThe environments, story and characters are all randomized, so every playthrough is different, although you will visit the same locations a lot. There is enough variety in the story to keep things fresh. Replayability 10/10\n\nThe graphics are retro-style and well done. Like the rest of the game, the artwork has personality. No crazy over-the-top effects, but also not generic. It really feels like a game from 1989, not a game from 2016 pretending to be a game from 1989. Graphics 8/10\n\nThe story is randomly generated, and often surprised me with its off-beat humour. There are many, many story events that can occur, and your choices can have very dire circumstances. As much as you might want to pick the 'cool' or 'funny' or 'interesting' choice, it might be best to pick the 'safe' choice, or else your trip to Canada will be cut short! Story 8/10\n\nThe music is great! Very catchy retro-chiptune kind of stuff, mixed in with some nifty guitars. Very off-beat and full of personality. The music is light-hearted, and not moody. In some cases it doesn't seem to fit the theme of the game, but I kind of prefer that the music is so light-hearted for a game about the zombie apocalypse. Music 9/10\n\nOverall, this game is probably the only game I'm going to play for a long time. I have almost 70 games in my Steam library, and I feel like this is the best $15 I've ever spent. Overall 9/10\n\nPros: \n- VERY replayable. Every time you die, you want to start over again, and it doesn't feel that repetitive.\n- Fun, laid back game, but with a lot of hectic gameplay moments\n- Good balance of difficulty, good balance of loot\n- Lots of modes to unlock\n\nCons: \n- None", "timestamp_created": 1469185839, "timestamp_updated": 1469296250, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.464427", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24457295": {"recommendationid": "24457295", "author": {"steamid": "76561198151777533", "num_games_owned": 126, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 3744, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513016291}, "language": "english", "review": "It's amazing!", "timestamp_created": 1469183762, "timestamp_updated": 1469183762, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.407958", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24457199": {"recommendationid": "24457199", "author": {"steamid": "76561198126636269", "num_games_owned": 805, "num_reviews": 101, "playtime_forever": 419, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492292816}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6e38\u620f\u867d\u5c0f\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u5f88\u597d\u73a9\n\u8bb2\u8ff0\u7684\u662f\u672b\u65e5\u4e2d\u4f60\u542c\u95fb\u52a0\u62ff\u5927\u662f\u4e2a\u5341\u5206\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u5730\u65b9\uff0c\u4e8e\u662f\u51b3\u5b9a\u4e00\u8def\u524d\u5f80\u52a0\u62ff\u5927\u907f\u96be\uff01\n\u4eba\u7269\u53ef\u4ee5\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u5c5e\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u7a0d\u5fae\u7684\u634f\u4e00\u634f\u221a\n\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u6709\u8bb8\u591a\u7ec6\u5fae\u7684\u7ec6\u8282\u221a\n\u6e38\u620f\u4f34\u968f\u7740\u4e00\u5b9a\u7684\u968f\u673a\u6027\u221a\n\u975e\u6d32\u4eba\u7684\u6211\u4e3a\u5565\u5c31\u662f\u6ca1\u6709\u8d44\u6e90\u00d7\n\u6e38\u620f\u53ef\u73a9\u6027\u76f8\u5bf9\u6ee1\u610f\u221a\n\u64cd\u4f5c\u624b\u611f\u4e0d\u4f1a\u611f\u5230\u96be\u53d7\u221a\n\u6ca1\u6709\u53ca\u65f6\u5b58\u6863\u00d7\n\u6e38\u620f\u6709\u4e9b\u6bd4\u8f83\u6709\u610f\u601d\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u7ec6\u8282\u221a\n\u8bc4\u5206 9.5/10 \u4ee4\u4eba\u773c\u524d\u4e00\u4eae\u7684\u5c0f\u6e38\u620f\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1469183290, "timestamp_updated": 1469183290, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 33, "votes_funny": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.776276", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24456927": {"recommendationid": "24456927", "author": {"steamid": "76561198138629111", "num_games_owned": 14, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 9127, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510238305}, "language": "english", "review": "Reach Canada, or die a lot trying to.\n\nLike the description says, this is a zombie road trip simulator with random events thrown as you go along your trip.

The repetitive nature is also...not really present, since there'll always be a selection of missions of varying difficulty for you to choose from and if you do feel the game is repetitive, take something above your paygrade (suffer a bit) and you'll be back to having fun in no time.  \n\n\"Hows the price to game length ratio looking?\"\n\nTrust me you're good in that department, this game will entertain you for a countless amount of hours, i can already tell. \n\n\"Any game breaking bugs?

If that's not enough, let me tell you a story\n\nI was not sold on this game until i attempted an extraction on a huge ship, horribly under geared for the mission. But there was a time limit on it, and i knew i'd never get another chance at it. Finding specific moments to use my teleporter gadget, and waiting for the opportune time to use one of my 3 grenades was exhilirating in it of itself, but i had rescued my target. The whole ship was on alert and multiple guards were chasing me. I was completely out of supplies, and only had ineffectual handguns in my inventory. There were far too many guards and not enough hiding spots between me and my escape pod, so i contemplated for a solid 20 minutes when i realized i could shoot out the glass on the ship. i equipped my handgun and shot the glass, hurling both me and my target into space. I remote controlled my escape pod and collected both of us, narrowly avoiding a passing space station in the midst of collecting the target.

That's basically Heat Signature.\n\nThanks to all the mechanics (weapons, teleporters, enemies, other gadgets and so on) this game is really skillful. I'm still figuring out more and more interactions and clever uses of already known mechanics and it's really satisfying. There's different weapons, teleporters and various gadgets all with their advantages and drawbacks. All of that going into different ship layouts, enemies and mission types. An argument I've seen from other reviewers is how the game is repetitive, but the core loop is good and there's enough of variety that I didn't find that as a problem.\n\nAs far as difficulty goes, game is quite easy. Progression keeps going forward no matter what. Character dies? Pick another. At worst you fail every mission and stagnate, in which case, the game happily throws an overpowered character at you so you can hopefully progress. The game is easy in other ways as well: guards are predictable and slow at reacting to you, loot is plentiful and powerful and some missions are just straight up easy (liberations especially). I mentioned previously how skillful the game is, that's still true, but you can definitely progress and beat the game either way. It feels like the game is trying to appease players of any skill level.\n\nThis brings me to my last point: speedrunning. This is one of the few games that got me interested into speedrunning it. Suddenly, being skillfull matters a lot more. Although it might also involve abusing certain items (looking at you, stealth shield), it's still really fun and I'm having fun attempting a record. Do join in! Leaderboard are not exactly populated as of this review.\n\nIn conclusion: I recommend the game, althought I warn that if you're looking for something especially difficult, this isn't it.

Over all, it is a very fun game that ultimately has a few shortcomings; mainly in difficulty and variety, but it will pull you in nonetheless. Once you hit a certain level of progression and/or skill, death becomes a fantasy. Oh no! 5 guards with guns have noticed you! Sidewinder, no longer in lign of sight. Stealth shield, no longer in line of sight. Slipstream, easily incapacitate all guards. Swapper, make the guards shoot them self. Double wrench, knock into one guard, throw the wrench you just used at another, knock into another guard, throw that wrench, pick up the first wrench you threw, and throw it at the final guard. The difficulty largely is based on shields and/or armor, which is merely beaten by having the right items to deal with, or more guards. The game, however, is still engaging. You rush through liberations, taking bigger and bigger missions until you can get a new liberation in 2 missions, and then do the admittedly extremely fun defector missions, if ultimately useless. You gain all the good items until almost nothing can beat you, or if it can, offworld angel angels you from death,  and then you retire, selling all your hard earned crap to try to get a self-charging item to retire with, letting one of your later characters obtain the admittedly OP self-charging items.

And even still, the first scenario shown in the trailer isn't as badass as it gets. 5 guys standing right in the entrance of the ship? No problem. Go inside, cope with the fact that everyone in that room has spotted you and wants you dead, bash the first guy you see with the wrench in your right hand, bash the second guy with your left-hand wrench, throw a wrench at the third guy, throw your other wrench at the fourth guy, pick up one of their guns, and use it to shoot the fifth guy. Did someone just waltz to the same room in the time it took that to transpire? No problem, if your gun's still reloading, you can throw that at him to knock him unconscious, too.\n\nIf I had to describe the two \"focus points\" of the game, it's about feeling (and looking) like a badass, and finding solutions to tricky problems.\n\nDoes the guy you want dead have a shield that prevents you from shooting him? You know that Subverter thing from the trailer, that lets you hack enemy turrets to shoot the ship's crew instead of you? It works on shields, too. Invert it so that instead of letting bullets out but not in, it lets bullets in but not out. And before you know it, the guy's bullet just bounced off his own shield, and killed him for you.\n\nDid EVERYONE on the 50-something crew ship just hear you? Well... Figure it out on your own, you're gonna have to make the best of what you've got to get out of that one. That's actually happened, though. I had to knock 50 people out, and the mission required me to leave no witnesses, so I gathered all of their bodies in one of the engine rooms, shot the fuel tank, and sent all of them into space. That was fun.\n\nAs you play more, liberating stations and breaking into harder ships, you unlock new toys to solve new kinds of problems. Like armored enemies. So... You're saying it's like a shotgun, but instead of bullets, it fires acid, which dissolves the enemy's armor, followed by their flesh, followed by their skeletons and vital organs? Sign me up!\n\nThis game really is a sandbox where you can feel badass any time you want. I'd definitely recommend this to anyone and everyone.

Normally that combination puts me off, because of what feels to me like a high risk of losing a character (and the time spent honing their skills and/or equipment)  for little specific benefit to the game overall.

I finished the game and had good fun the first 4-5 hours playing this and I'm perfectly ok with that. However, this brings me to my first problem with the game:\n\nThe difficulty curve. At the start of the game, there's a lot going on and you're trying to make sense of the different weapons and gadgets as well as the flow of the game. This is fun. However, once you get 4-5 hours in, you have gotten the flow of the game down and realize that you actually only need a couple of gadgets to defeat a mission of any difficulty. Coupled with the fact that you get better and better starting equipment the longer you progress in the game, this makes the game too easy at this point. So, the latter half of the game is pretty much an excercise in grinding liberations as quick as possible in order to get to the stronghold missions.\n\nWhich is my second gripe. The stronghold missions are also way too easy. Clone keys, slow down time, run to captain, done. Or approach it however you want. As long as you have some key items, you'll have no problems with them. This brings me to my third point:\n\nThe incoporation of randomness in the ships layout is not a good choice for a game of this type. The ships play out too similarly, which adds to the repetitive feeling during the latter half of the game. I feel that you need level design in order to make it interesting during the whole game. A good example here would be Hotline Miami, which makes better use of ramping difficulty because of level design.\n\nAs far as positive notes go, I did enjoy the flow of the game and the chaining of orders overall. It's very fun to execute orders and watch your character dismember the opposition with swords. I also really appreciated the way the game generate stories for you to elaborate. For example, the time I got sucked out a window with my captured person and managed to pick up both of us with a second to spare. I found that pretty cool, and there's a lot of that stuff happening.\n\nAll in all, it's an ok game, but I didn't find it that enjoyable all together. If you're interested in this game I would recommend Hotline Miami, Invisible Inc., or FTL instead.

His Youtube videos are inspiring and simple to follow. I noticed that he started putting out videos of Heat Signature while it was in its early devleopment stages and looked fun. It really is. Controls are simple and intuitive. Combat can be a bit overly simplistic but that can be taken as a positive aspect. If Tom was going for simple, fun, quick, and easy to pick up, he nailed it. However simple the game may be, if you look at all the creative ways to hijack an enemy ship, you'll see that the simplicity of the game is actually a facade. You can do some really fun stuff and execute enemies in the most creative, brutal and efficient fashion. The price is right and the music is pretty good at setting the mood. I don't always review games but I had to say a few words regarding this title. If you're on the fence about this game, just check out the many Youtube vidoes Tom (the developer) published over the years to report on the progress of the title.

It would have been way better, if they had kind of an climax leading towards them, and not just pay 200 Credits and probably need an armour-piercieng weapon. I think especially with the station-liberating missions, there are some great opportunities wasted, you just have to capture a siege ship and ram the station??? so you destroy the station, then they like you, then you get the station??? why not sneak onto a transport ship which is navigating to the station and then have several levels/areas there, were you are killed, when you fail? The way it is, it feels kind of unsatisfying\n-(minor spoiler!!!) I think, when you are captured and rescue your character, the rescued person should lose all his equipment not stashed, sure, it's nice, not to lose your good stuff, but it's really illogical to simply keep it.\n- no coop-mode, which would be really nice\n- after some time it becomes kind of easy, also because most of the time, you have to fear no consequences, just catch yourself with your pod, redock, maybe hurry up and kill the captain, and you're fine. It would be great, if another crew member started flying the ship, after they saw that the captain is uncapable of doing so.\n\nEven though some things about this game bother me, it's still really fun to play, but more as a game in between.

Whether it's due to the Fair Points update or not, you can essentially make a character that can ghost 9/10 of the hardest missions you see. While it makes it fun to speedrun, it's quite easy to do succeed at almost anything if you're even a little bit cautious. Slipstream, stealth field, and most particularly, key cloner helps in that regard. It also seems that it's the equipment that make the player, and nothing else. You're only distinct visually otherwise.\n\nMy suggestions: \n\nJammers, can't use equipment such as key cloners/teleporters etc. in radius/on ship. Perhaps also prevent self-charging. This would be good for difficulty.\n\nCompetent Enemies: Shout intruder if they see a glimpse of you when you're literally right beside them (so to avoid just using stealth field all the time, going right past them.) Shouts intruder if you swap with them. If you peek around the corner, they'll go in a group, not by themselves, to investigate. They're able to switch weapons like you, and use grenades effectively around corners, shouting as to prevent friendly fire. Being able to lunge against the player with appropiate melee weapons would be also cool, giving priority to who wins by who lunges first.\n\nGrapple Hooks: Chain an enemy temporarily to a location, also making them aggressive, but unable to chase. Targetting yourself prevents you from being shot out into space.\n\nNo rechargable 5/5 stealth fields or 5/5 key cloners. Those things should be unique, not on sale for 20 at the store.\n\nSlipstream should make you 1.5x faster while slowing down time 2x. At 5x speed, you go so fast that enemies can't react to anything you do, whether rushing it, grabbing the key, and getting out, or simply using it as improv stealth field. It's a freebie. If you get the 5/5 slipstream, it's 5 freebies.\n\nUnlimited item teleporting once the ship is secure, no cooldown.\n\nMake it so that the option to grab the body of the pilot vs. getting into the pilot's seat is distinct. They seem to overlap too much in the same space to select on or the other.\n\nUnique missions: Mistake missions in which the objective is stealing a unique item for yourself.

There is always a set way you can take on an objective, usually just taking out anyone in your path and performing the goal of the mission, but that's not what makes this game fun. You can play a character however you wish, with 4 playable characters at any given time. As the player, you are capable of choosing what to do with a character, whether it's one who doesn't believe in killing, using only concussive guns (Which, surprisingly does not mean you don't have to take assasination missions, you can deliver a target much like a rescue mission target, and it even nets an achievement) or one that is the exact opposite, going in with two shotguns and clearing rooms like there is no tomorrow, and anything in-between.\n\n    The game has one singular goal, and that is to essentially eliminate all the other factions by liberating all faction strongholds (There are 4 factions, one which uses \"non-lethal\" weapons against you, one which I think relates to teleporters, one which uses ballistic weapons, and one which uses swords.) and then the game essentially \"ends.\" but much like the missions the game has, the way to achieve this is very open-ended. You can either go straight to eliminating each faction, and finish it in the quickest way allowed, or go and liberate every single space-station (For that sweet-sweet achievement) before liberating the last strongholds. Otherwise the other objective is to retire your characters. Each character has a \"Personal Mission\" to perform before they are retired, it costs quite a bit to unlock the mission, and it is quite difficult to perform, often requiring cheesing the system or pure luck/skill, but when you do you get the option to retire the character and pass on one of their items to be able to be used by another character, provided you find it in a loot box. This can be done with every character you play as and is quite helpful, especially if you can find multiple of these items as a later character.\n\n    Among the other features, this game allows the player character to do plenty of amazing feats with it's pause feature, allowing you to pause the action, take a look at your options, and decide how you'll be playing the next few moments out in order to avoid being injured. Pausing is available at any time during gameplay, so as long as you don't forget it exists you can pull off pretty much any feat to eliminate as many enemies as possible and possibly survive.\n\n    Other notable things about this game include a really nice soundtrack, I enjoy listening to it while I play the game, as well as an interesting lore and different features for each mission you perform, enemies will constantly be changing kit based on which faction's ship you'll be boarding and the difficulty of the level. The lore exists through ex-members of each faction, located in space-stations liberated from those factions. The game is also frequently updated, which does help since bugs get patched incredibly quickly and the developers are constantly looking at issues in the game and balancing them. Also, the game isn't multiplayer, but does have some interaction with steam friends where you can rescue characters a friend might have had captured and be able to use it with all it's equipment or find the item of a steam-friend's retired character.\n\n    I purchased this game at launch, and the only issue I really have with it, and the only reason i'm currently on hiatus with not many hours played on it is that it does get repetitive. I found myself getting bored because the missions have very little variety, indeed there are different missions, but once you've played the same on on the same ship 10 times it does get slightly aggravating, to the point where when steam randomly decided the game wasn't installed and I had to reinstall I just wasn't willing to go through all I went through over again, although that's not to say I won't go back.\n\n    Overall, on my completely subjective and arbitrary rating scale, this game is a solid 8/10 in it's category, and it is one that I would honestly recommend to anyone I know, especially those that like either strategy, or shooters in the vein of Hotline Miami.", "timestamp_created": 1511752289, "timestamp_updated": 1511752328, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37739774": {"recommendationid": "37739774", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993819978", "num_games_owned": 892, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1822, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 516, "last_played": 1514311248}, "language": "english", "review": "Best roguelike I've played.

I was out of Subverter and Crash ammunition, had exhausted my Sidewinder teleporter and Stealth Shield, and had only a gun useless against shields and a Slipstream personal accelerator.

Then, the enemies nearby (there were still over 10 in the room while I did this) shot me and threw me out the window I'd shot out earlier.

Also, instead of pausing in and pausing out, how about an option for \"holding\" the key (or button/trigger if gamepad can be added) and then let go to get back into the action. There's the additional, disorienting effect of having the pause menu but also having a slowed-down framerate whenever I come freshly out of combat. Maybe this is just me. This was executed beautifully in DOOM with the weapon wheel.\n\n\nWhy are there cooldown timers? Just require a reload key'button from outside the pause menu to remind me that I'm empty. I forget about the cooldown and since they are different for every weapon I stutter over my tactics everytime I change weapons. Why have a primary and a secondary? You can only fire/use one weapon at a time, and you can change to ANY weapon at ANY time from the pause menu. Make weapon selection mouse wheel scroll or pad/bumper selection from the gamepad.\n\nSwitching between mouse controls for the pod and WASD for interior shop/station control also clunky and kills immersion. Again, with gamepad it could be done seamlessly between two joysticks so I never have to go from a nice smooth mouse to a Cherry MX mechanical key slap.\n\nI think the reason for this review is that I don't want to write this game off, I think it has a LOT of potential and I'd like to see it progress, but for now I's just too unplayable for me, and I can't recommend it.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1511711210, "timestamp_updated": 1511711210, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.481729", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37683484": {"recommendationid": "37683484", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043795443", "num_games_owned": 657, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1279, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511710223}, "language": "russian", "review": "[b][i]10 \u0431\u0435\u0441\u0441\u043e\u0437\u043d\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0442\u043e\u0432 \u0432 \u043a\u043e\u0441\u043c\u043e\u0441\u0435 \u0438\u0437 10[/i][/b]\n\n\u0421\u043f\u0430\u0441\u0438\u0431\u043e", "timestamp_created": 1511710547, "timestamp_updated": 1511710547, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516129", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37682612": {"recommendationid": "37682612", "author": {"steamid": "76561198150584637", "num_games_owned": 74, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 537, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 20, "last_played": 1513440886}, "language": "english", "review": "I enjoy this game immensely.

The latest update has also made a lot of improvements to the game to speed up progression and eliminate risk of a character dying (if that's a problem for you).", "timestamp_created": 1511634618, "timestamp_updated": 1511634618, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37563222": {"recommendationid": "37563222", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006522521", "num_games_owned": 307, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1673, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512311873}, "language": "english", "review": "All the goofy fun of Gunpoint but in space.", "timestamp_created": 1511633332, "timestamp_updated": 1511633332, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37559077": {"recommendationid": "37559077", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003014717", "num_games_owned": 319, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1049, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 34, "last_played": 1514342329}, "language": "english", "review": "First Game I ever took the time to review. \n\nPlays super smooth, real fun. \n\nMechanics are enjoyable, fluid, and  not glitchy at all. \n\nGame has suprisng depth. \n\nI have put a lot more hours in this, than most triple A studio games I pick up from steam.", "timestamp_created": 1511631406, "timestamp_updated": 1511631406, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37552487": {"recommendationid": "37552487", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086703322", "num_games_owned": 65, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 681, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511734370}, "language": "english", "review": "Hotline Miami meets FTL.\n\nYou do what you have to do to complete your mission.\nThere is never a lot of story to get into, you can play it as long or short as you have time for.\n\nHave you ever wanted to just do whatever it takes to complete your mission, not mattter how ridiculous your plan might be?\nGo for it, there is nothing more fun than just performing some crazy stunts, only to kill one person.\n\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1511628494, "timestamp_updated": 1511628494, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37550906": {"recommendationid": "37550906", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035677837", "num_games_owned": 61, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 556, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 93, "last_played": 1513816801}, "language": "english", "review": "Makes me feel like a ninja, a ninja that dies many times, but a ninja.", "timestamp_created": 1511627809, "timestamp_updated": 1511627809, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37547043": {"recommendationid": "37547043", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057149138", "num_games_owned": 134, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1726, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 727, "last_played": 1514255341}, "language": "english", "review": "Heat Signature combines puzzling, sci-fi, and badassery in a tight, replayable package. The regular missions provide excellent variety, real danger, and great sense of accomplishment. The 'Liberator' missions stand out, as they are so tough that they make me fully explore each and every mechanic in the game, however you can replay them endlessly until you get it right. Can you knock out a room with 4 guards in before they sound the alarm, with just a blade and a short range teleporter? You will find out how, and once you've learned, you take those skills into the real world missions. Rarely have I played a game that teaches it's core mechanics in such an ingenius way. 10/10. \nSee story-time below.\n\nI choose to accept a rescue mission. The mission is labeled a 'Mistake' and has the 'Ghost' clause: No deaths, no incapacitations, don't be seen. Just snag a guy and ghost the place. I pick my loadout, optimize it for stealth and throw in a few key cloners, as well as my trusty self-charging EMP gun, to deactivate any electronics that could detect me. I hop into my pod, and zip off in pursuit of my target. It's a ship belonging to the Offworld Security faction, so it's going to be close quarters. \nI dock my pod with their airlock. They don't know I'm here. I sneak my way into a hallway. Ahead is corrdidor with 5 guards, one of them carrying a key. First I deactivate their shields and infrared detector fields. Then I use the key cloner to snag the key. That was the easy part, now it's time to get up close and personal. My stealth shield only has a 5 second charge, only works across 180 degree angle, and the approaching hallway is long. I don't know if this will work. It's go time: I activate my shield, and immediately start to move. I enter the corridor with 3 seconds to spare. Sneaking past two guards no problem. The  guard blocking the other entrance of the corridor is closer to the wall than I would like. I hold my breath as I squeeze past. He doesn't notice. \nI use the stealth shield once more to sneak past an easier group of guards, and make it to the prisoner. Shit, I can't carry the prisoner and use the stealth shield at the same time. I physically throw the stealth field generator down a hallway, the noise catches the attention of the group of guards. There's my chance: I pick up the prisoner, and dash past them. I run to a control room with viewing deck, which I passed earlier. There's no time for finesse, the guards are on their way back. I pull out my silenced shotgun and blast the plasteel glass window. It explodes outward, in a shower of glass and air escaping into space: We're out of here. I feel like a badass. Even as the vacuum pulls us through this newly created door, I start remote controlling my pod. First it picks up the prisoner, then myself. The package is secure, and I'm on my way home.

I've found three types, and every time i get one, duplicate or not, it adds so much crazy fun to the game (I didn't read the patch notes so the new one caught me by surprise). Also, I really like the ability to go flying into space, but I think it would be really awesome if you could do it the other way around without having to find airlocks. I want some kind of magnetic boot or personal propulsion mechanism to fly you around a ship and smash through some window somewhere. Anyway, just a few things I'd love to see come to this already incredible game.

Einmal war der Pilot des Schiffs sehr nah an meinem Einstieg, wenn man den umbringt, dann fliegt das Schiff nicht zur n\u00e4chsten Station, wenn es angegriffen oder man als Eindringling erkannt wird. Also hab ich ihn get\u00f6tet und musste noch jemanden retten, der ziemlich weit am anderen ende lag. Es waren viel zu starke Gegner auf dem Weg dahin, also habe ich ein kleineres Schiff gekapert und das andere Schiff zu Klump geschossen.

Fortunately I was still on the section that had my objective in it. Unfortunately there was a locked door in my way with the only key still on board the other chunk of ship spinning through space. So naturally I flew to the other part to retrieve the key of course! after docking with the lost piece of the ship, killing the guards inside and then catching back up to the other part of the ship, I had a total of 32 seconds left to complete my mission before being caught. I hauled ass through the ship to grab the item I was asked to steal where I then paused the game and looked at a bright read number 5 at the top of my screen. I managed to just barely turn the corner of the next room fast enough to shoot the captain from 4 rooms away and with only 1 second left before being captured.\n\nA game that emphasizes thinking, that's what this is. Not just one type of thinking either. You can sit and plan out your mission from the very start with the information provided at the job listings board and even scout the ship completely as soon as you dock with it. You can alternatively just run in without any planning and figure things out as you go.

It's a fantastic game. Basically, you fly about in a little pod, board enemy spaceships, take out everyone aboard, and return to your base. Really, there are different sorts of missions available, such as \"steal the thing\", \"assassinate the dude\", or \"steal the ship\", but effectively it usually comes down to, \"go about and take everyone out, then do the thing\" as the most expedient method. Sometimes you can't kill anyone, but that's mostly just a gear check, requiring a wrench instead of a sword or a concussive gun instead of a lethal one. The tactics don't change much. They do change some, though, and deny you the use of cool things like traps that teleport enemies into space, as they'll suffocate. It actually reminds me a lot of how a non-lethal Dishonored run made you unable to use many of the cool gadgets. It's similarly a bit sad, but as in this it's on a ship by ship basis, it can be a nice change of pace. Unless you have a bunch of cool lethal weapons you're itching to use and instead have to go about knocking people out with a wrench like a lamebutt.\n\nAnd if you're like me, you must get past its graphics. They're quite ugly, to my eyes. Less subjectively, it can often be very difficult to tell what objects in a level are passable set dressing, and which block movement and line of sight. I got shot a few times due to this, expecting enemies to not see me and instead being shot as I tried furiously to backpedal. However, characters are immenently replaceable, so even the one I lost due to this I didn't mind too much.\n\nI have other gripes - many, in fact. The AI's patrol routines are far too exploitable, which can make missions meant to be hard (or even \"audacious\" or \"mistake\") too easy, but slow and boring. Forcing you to play suboptimally to make the game fun. Never a good thing to the force the player to do.\n\nAnd the enemies could use some variety. They're all humans, with a handful of pieces of equipment available to them - mostly just shields, teleportation, armour, and explosives that go off if they die violently (though if you knock them out and THEN kill them, for some reason they don't explode - perhaps you're disarming them? I dunno.).\n\nThere are also only two types of enemy per level. The mooks have one combination of gear, the \"bosses\" have another, usually one that makes them a little trikier to deal with. But not remotely deserving of the title \"boss.\"\n\nThe changing combinations of gear in each ship do provide a good deal of variety. Hours worth of it, even. And combine this with the changing gear you have as you retire characters and start new ones, and your playstyle will change often, keeping things fresh a lot longer.\n\nThe ship layouts are also quite boring. Mostly square rooms, the occasional bigger rectangular room, connected by straight hallways. It gets old.\n\nIf they put out a DLC with more enemy types and fights on planet surfaces or something - anything with more open, chaotic environments that made you think harder about each new level - I'd jump on it so fast.

The gameplay is fun and unique, without being too gimicky. It scratches same itch that Hotline Miami does, with fast paced, top-down combat, and encouraging multiple ways to get through a level. The game world feel conquerable and populated but without losing the vast emptyness of space. Outside of this initial experience with the game, I won't list every pro and con; there are many other reviews and blogs that have that covered. I have played many more hours of Heat Signature than my 10ish hours on Steam would indicate (I bought the DRM-free version from Humble Store).\n\nWith the most recent update, several features have been added, seemingly to make the game easier. One of my major gripes with this game is how easy it becomes after liberating a few stations. Unlock just a few decent weapons and tools and you'll be good to go on any new character. Several of these changes simply modify in game textures to make certain types of npcs and bits of terrain easier to distinguish, and that's fine. In fact, all of these changes were fine, even the 'cheat' to turn off permadeath. All these features appeal to at least some of the player base. \n\nWhat I would have liked to have seen in addition to these changes, would be some options for increasing the difficulty and challenge level. In my main save file, even losing my most geared up character isn't a huge deal, because after a few missions I can afford the same 'rare' gear that I've unlocked from liberating stations. Retiring a character, and being able to leave a custom named heirloom behind for other characters, while a very cool idea, doesn't really work in the context of the game. The drop rates are too low to be likely to find one before you unlock the exact same weapon in the shop.\n\nOne thing that I find very concerning, is a line from the changlog of the most recent update (at the time of posting).\n\"This update is a one-off, we don\u2019t plan to do updates like this on a regular basis. We might add items from time to time, but only buy the game if you want the game as it stands \u2013 we don\u2019t make promises about future content.\"\nThis game as it is currently, is lacking content. Adding a new gun every once and a while will not provide enough new and exciting action to support, what is already a game that is too repetitive. I would like to see at least one major content update (even as a dlc expansion), or support for modifications. \n\nI very rarely find a game that makes me excited to wake up the next day in order to resume playing it. I can honestly say that Heat Signature was one of those games. Considering the most recent update addressed many 'fair points' brought up by the community, I have faith that the developers are listening and willing to make changes where it's deemed necessary. As the game is now, I cannot recommend it, at least not at the current price, with the knowledge that major content updates are not guarenteed, or even in the works.

If I'm being honest, I had probably discovered most if not all of the weapons and items by the time I had liberated my first outpost.  That said, there are a decent number of modifiers to be discovered which add a bit more content to it, but overall there isn't that much weapon-wise.  Most of this game's content lies within the randomly generated(I assume, otherwise props to the devs for hand-crafting just about infinity ships) ships and extensive missions, as well as the permadeath randomly generated(again, if the characters aren't randomly created, props to the devs) characters.  Each and every mission is different, and you have to think and use the charges of your weapons carefully each time.  You will always end up getting new characters, however, as there are just so many features in the game that *suggest*(assertively) that you make new characters.  So, if you are looking for a ton of cool weapons to use to kill people in space, this might not be for you, but I still recommend you try it because I have had a lot of fun just from the extensiveness of the ships and characters.

Up until that point, she had been the most successful galactic renaissance leader we'd ever seen, ruthlessly hijacking any ship she deemed fit weilding concussion hammers, traveling so quickly no one person ever saw her for a mere second before flying down the corridor, ribs shattered from the impact. Up until the last mission at least. She miscalculated, didn't have enough time. Didn't have the key, or the tools, to get through the door to get to the pilot before they arrived at the station, and was caught.\n\nThis is where Pavo Starspelt came in. Eden Phase's father. He heard that his daughter was abducted and threw his life away to hunt down the Offworld Security ship that had Eden, and swore to bring her to safety. He armed himself with anything he could find, including a silenced shotgun, a self-charging visitor, a concussive grenade launcher, a subverter, a long-range extreme capacity key cloner, and a personal shield amoung other things.\n\nHe finally hunted down the ship with Eden inside and went to infiltrate. Eight layers of security. He didn't have enough memory on the key cloner to get through quietly. He managed to sneak past the first four layers of security without much hastle, stealing a key from one of the guards while he wasn't looking and getting into the fifth to kill off the pilot. They weren't going anywhere any time soon. He managed to sneak past a group of five guards and hack one of the panels, unlocking level 6. This is where he started to run out of utility. \n\nThere were turrets around every other corner at this point, and hordes of police that would swarm him if any of them went off. He had to time his movements perfectly to get past everything without being seen and sneak up behind them, which he managed. He got to level 7 security - and that's where he messed up. \n\nThere was a turret on the other side he hadn't seen that immediately went to shoot him. In a split second he managed to pop the security shield that absorbed the rounds and teleport away with the visitor to kill every guard within range of the sound with the silenced shotgun, trying to wipe any form of alert from the ship. But it was too late. He had to fight his way through. He killed everyone that came towards him, coming inches from getting shot on multiple occasions. Always on the move, eventually getting close enough to the turret to subvert it, turning it to his side. He was lucky enough that the guy with the key card turned the corner and was shot by the same turret, grabbed the key card, and sprinted through the security 8 door. \n\nThis is the area Eden was in, but he had used almost all of his utility to get to this point, and there were still guards in the first 4 levels of security he had bypassed, so he couldn't go back to his ship, not directly at least. He popped a shield and ran directly for Eden, the single room surrounded by at least 12 guards. At this point, he had no more ammo, and no more grenades. The key cloner was useless, and the visitor would only bring him back to where he was after a second and leave Eden behind if he were carrying her, so he couldn't use it for getaways. That left the two charges he had left on the personal shield.\n\nHe managed to make it to Eden, using his shield again to protect her as he ran away. One charge remaining. There were too many guards to make it out the same way he came in, so he had to find another way. The glass. He ran past a corridor with one of the police looking for him. He had a personal shield as well. Running back towards the way he came, careful not to round any corners before the enemy could see him, luring him back to the Security 7 zone, and past the turret he had subverted. The only problem is the round would bounce right off his shield.\n\nHe rounded the corner to the hallway the turret protected as it turned to face his direction, the Offworld Security Officer followed, and was nearly instantly barraged with a burst of ammo from the turret. The rounds passed Pavo, inches away, and slammed into the Offworld Security Officer's shield, bouncing back towards him. He threw Eden behind him and popped the last charge of his shield, and the ammo bounced off of him. It went flying straight though the massive observatory window, shattering it and sucking all of them; Officer, Pavo, and Eden, into the depths of space.\n\nPavo knew he had to exhale in order to get all the air he could out of his lungs. Otherwise, they'd expand inside him and kill him. He looked around for Eden, having been ripped from his Offworld Security ship as the glass broke, thrown out into the vacuum of space. She was floating away from him. He went for the remote control band on his arm and undocked his ship, hurriedly flying it past the wreckage he had just been through and towards Eden, trying desperately to catch her first incase he suffocated there in space, at least knowing she would be safe. He managed to catch her as he was starting to black out, and throttled the ship towards himself as he started to lose his own vision, managing by some sliver of a hair to catch himself in the depths of space before passing out on the floor of his ship, drifting deeper into space.\n\nThey eventually woke up and flew back to their home system, where Pavo retired. And rightfully so. He had \"Eden's Protection\" engraved on the side of the silenced shotgun he had used, and gave it to Eden. He would have used the personal shield, but it had been though so much it wouldn't work any more. Since then, Eden has been the most successful Legend, liberating over 7 star systems single-handedly with the help of her father's shotgun.

Two self-charging Visitors completely break the game.\n\nAs you progress through the overworld you get more guaranteed access to this powerful gear, having it available in the shop rather than needing to loot it from fallen enemies or chests. This is great for letting you try out insane combos, but also gives you the ability to just buy insane gear and eliminate all challenge from the game. The mechanics of retirement and completing the \"campaign\" and resetting your world do a great job of letting you have all that power, but giving you reasons to choose to start fresh.

To the game, I mean. This review too. But the game mostly. It added some new content, which is totally appreciated. I'll spend some more hours in-game and adjust my review then.[/i]\n\nFantastic and unique core gameplay, expanded on using roguelike elements, but limited by a lack of long-term consequences, variety, and narrative, plus confusing graphics and UI. If you're like me, I'd recommend it on the basis of being interestingly innovative alone, but you'll also get a ~12 hour playthrough if you only play the enjoyable parts. A 100% completion run isn't worth it, though you'll probably keep popping in during lunch break.\n\nI wouldn't ask you to believe me without verification, so let's go over some specific examples (without spoilers):\n\n[b]CORE GAMEPLAY![/b] Real-time-with-pause top-down 2D shooter with one-hit-kills/knockouts. WASD to move, mouse to aim, click to fire, all controls rebindable. Missions rarely last more than five minutes, and you can speed through most in under thirty seconds. However, you have infinite slo-mo (automatically applies while in sight of an enemy, but can also be bound to a key), and can pause, adjust your aim, and fire. Thrown in the mix is a simple stealth system; there's no fog of war on the player's end, but stay in a guard's cone of vision and an alarm sounds, causing a doom timer to start (game time; pausing and slo-mo stop and slow the timer, respectively). Expect to ask yourself \"If I pop out of cover, can I shoot everyone in the room before they raise the alarm/shoot back?\", and \"Can I use a gadget to lure people out of the room, sneak by, or give myself extra time to shoot?\" The quick time to kill makes combat visceral, ala twitch shooters, but adjustable pacing prioritizes thinking over reflexes and marksmanship, ala tactical shooters. It's beautiful.\n\n[b]ROGUELIKE ELEMENTS![/b] \"Soft\" permadeath: death wipes your cash and inventory, but campaign progress remains. Also noteworthy: getting hit knocks you out even with weapons that kill everyone else. However, taking hits reduces the likelihood you'll survive next time. The game randomly generates the player characters, mission layouts and objectives, guard positions and equipment, unlock trees, and shop inventories, but tempers this with player choice; get a mission or character you don't like and you can choose another from a small list. There's little overarching story besides \"end the war\", but there is some short, structures, and surprisingly philosophical and funny conversations to unlock (When is it right to kill? What constitutes a person? What drives corporations? Why does the training machine have a \"MORE VIOLENCE\" button?).\n\n[b]LACK OF CONSEQUENCES![/b] We've gone over how bullets treat you special. There's stat tracking for kills, knockouts, alarms, and living witnesses, but these oddly don't matter outside the occasional bonus objective. Kill with impunity and guards never think to ditch stun guns. Cause alarms and no one steps up security. Leave witnesses and no one comes after you. It's a fantastic foundation for a reputation system, and nothing's utilized. The absolute worst setback the game throws at you is death, but you only lose your cash and inventory (replaceable with a half hour's play at most, and you'll still progress the campaign during that time). There's never any meaningfully risky missions, which means you're never too worried about consequences, which robs the game of meaningful long-term choices, which limits long-term replay value.\n\n[b]LACK OF VARIETY![/b] The positions of rooms themselves vary, but you'll recognize room every layout within an hour. You'll have seen most of the gear in six, minus a few rare variants you'll never get to keep anyways. Not helping matters are the defector missions; optional challenges that give you limited but interesting gear restrictions in an effort to make you aware of new playstyles. Unfortunately, this spoils a lot of mechanics while giving no progress whatsoever, thus making the rest of the game a retread. Even the guards follow predictable patterns, never looking for missing comrades or leaving their designated section unprovoked. There's missed opportunities for variety everywhere; every bullet flies the same speed, room layouts never combine into larger rooms, guards use only a handful of available weapons, the game's set in space but never uses aliens, and so on.\n\n[b]LACK OF NARRATIVE![/b] Am I the good guy? Who am I working for? What am I working for? Supposedly the region's at war, but who does that affect? What's at stake? There's the extremely well-written conversations that flesh out the faction's beliefs and government, but there's not much payoff besides a few laughs and some interesting ideological discussion. The characters you're talking to never do anything, the factions function mostly the same gameplay-wise (good idea making the police faction use non-lethal weapons, but the illusion was broken when they put missile launchers on their ships). I have very little reason to suspend disbelief, which makes caring about the story or messaging near impossible. I mean, I guess there's some anarchist theming? You're fighting for the region's independence, and that corporate faction's pretty bad, so I guess it's better than those guys. But there's three other factions with roughly the same influence, and there's no obvious ideological reason they can't get along. You got an engineer faction, a police faction, and a nomad faction, with no known history between them. Not exactly Sunnis and Shias. Why are we fighting again? Oh, right, it's a videogame.\n\n[b]CONFUSING GRAPHICS AND UI![/b] This is better served with screenshots. Best of times [url=https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/857236050649859360/CCDD59000B124F0BFA70A3853D354A3E7AB57ABD/]here[/url], worst of times [url=https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/857236050652732362/DAE80188BE8D238B5BD6FB2B2A9B427B794B2283/]here[/url]. They should speak for themselves.\n\n[b]ALSO THE MUSIC'S FUNCTIONAL BUT FORGETABLE![/b] It's all instrumental tracks and they're typical sci-fi-esque. Mysterious electronic theme while flying through space, neutral electronic theme while at a friendly station, slightly more intense electronic theme while on enemy spaceships, you get the drill. Not that it's phoned in; the beeps and boops have just the right amount of polish to convey the tone. Unfortunately, that tone is too generic to convey anything interesting. I blame the narrative; without anything interesting to say, the composer doesn't have anything to reinforce. Maybe if the factions had individual themes? The mechanic faction could mix in industrial, the corporate faction could mix in pop chords and beats, the police faction could mix in academy-style drums, the nomad faction could mix in classical strings. Right now, the music just...exists.\n\n[u]Final Verdict:[/u] Buy it, the core gameplay's just that good. Avoid the defector missions that aren't labeled \"special\". Hunt achievements, they're decent enough excuses to play. I'd love to see some tweaks, and I'd pay money for an expansion, maybe something a little more narrative focused or with long-term consequences. Regardless, it's enjoyable as is.

I can't pick them off one by one, because they're always in view of each other\n2. this was the first room. There are no other docking areas. I have to open the airlock and 2-3 would spot me, and I'd have to cross the 3 blocks of rooms to get to them.\n\nBut I've got a rechargeable sidewinder, silenced rapid fire shotgun, and rechangeable slipstream. I sidewindered to the group, popped slipstream, and proceeded to shotgun and throw wrench at all of them before any of them knew what happened. This ended up being so much easier/faster than my previous method of waiting for them 1 by 1 I started doing it all the time, now abusing wrench dash instead of sidewinder, or killing those facing me first instead of slipstream. Awesome sauce.\n\nAnother time I accidentally set off an alarm on a very big ship from the first room. Some of the guards had explosives on them, so if I killed them the whole ship would hear and everyone would rush to them, THROUGH THE LOCKED DOORS. So whenever they'd rush to the sound and open a locked door, I'd pause and sidewinder past it. I sidewindered my ass to the commander and killed him in record time.

You have goals, but you don't have to do them if you don't want to.  You have missions, but you can accomplish them any way you want.  Even the character you play as doesn't have to complete his personal missions, sometimes things don't get done.  You instead are set loose into this world of spacestations and ships, and you learn to use the systems.  At first, its going to feel simple, then as you learn and can get to the harder missions, you will see the number of options given to you.  The best way to learn of each tools usefulness is by completing the little defector missions that appear. Besides that, just experiment or more than likely you will accidently stumble upon it and it will kill you.  This is a bite sized experience that you can seriously dig into.  One thing about it though is when you have unlocked the more advanced gadgets, its very easy to find a good combo, and never use anything else.  I wish the late game did more to force you too challenge yourself. \n\nSpecs\nCPU: i7-3930k\nGPU: GTX 1060\nRAM: 16gb\nSSD or HDD: SSD\nMonitor: 1920 x 1080", "timestamp_created": 1510529323, "timestamp_updated": 1510529323, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36474659": {"recommendationid": "36474659", "author": {"steamid": "76561198209045457", "num_games_owned": 72, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 950, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512677834}, "language": "english", "review": "fantastic game, its been great so far but id say by about 15 hours playtime it will start getting a bit repetitive.", "timestamp_created": 1510506367, "timestamp_updated": 1510506367, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36461980": {"recommendationid": "36461980", "author": {"steamid": "76561198287974862", "num_games_owned": 25, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1474, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510277277}, "language": "english", "review": "Heat Signature is a fun game for I'd say the first 5-10 hours. It gets very repetitive towards the endgame and only becomes fun for your average completionist, and even if you are the completionist, the achievements are quite easy.\n\nStory and Lore:\nThere are 4 Factions. Offworld, The Foundry, The Sovereign, and the Glitchers. Your goal is to liberate the different nodes in each of the faction's territory, ultimately liberating the stronghold of the faction. Liberating nodes is quite simple, really, do missions, gain enough progress to liberate the next node. Other than that as the main hook of the story, there isn't anything much else. Characters come with personal missions, steal this, rescue him, kill her, and that's really the only thing about the characters that is unique, aside from the randomized starter gear. You can find a few NPCs to talk to after liberating a stronghold that provide a background on the inner workings of the Faction, but not that much.\n\n5/10 Story.\n\nGameplay:\nHotline Miami, but with slow motion, and in space. You get a mission from the missions board varying in difficulty, and will pay more the harder it is so that you can purchase more gear for your character. Then, you get in your pod, fly to the ship, and lock on. \n\nOnce you're inside, you have to complete your mission. You can pause time and make whatever preparations you need to while paused. While learning it, it's very interesting, as the feeling of killing many enemies at once in one room using only a few wrenches is nice, but after playing the game for a bit, it again gets very repetitive. Pause, hit, move on.\n\nThere are various things to help you do your missions, teleporters that only work if there's an unblocked path from your character to your destination, teleporters that swap you with another person, and teleporters that bring you to your destination temporarily. There are things that make you invisible, make you 5x faster than everything else, give you a shield. There are only 3 types of guns, with a few characteristics making them unique. Basically, there's not a lot of gear yet in the game.\n\n7/10 Gameplay.\n\nSummary:\nSorry, I suck at writing reviews.\n\nBut as I said in the start, it's fun for a while, but get's very repetitive, not much else to do aside from the same old missions on the same 4 faction ships varying in size. I would only recommend getting this if you aren't limited to a small budget, like me. It's a nice quick fun experience but I have a very limited budget for steam, so if you have like, 5 bucks or something, save it up instead of getting this.\n\nOverall: 6.7/10\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1510468282, "timestamp_updated": 1510468282, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 58, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.625901", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36458647": {"recommendationid": "36458647", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068923869", "num_games_owned": 21, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 15547, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3785, "last_played": 1513610696}, "language": "english", "review": "game is great for short burst play when you only have 20 minutes to screw around.

Some people might not like the core gameplay loop, but I did, I never got bored of it. \n\nAlso, when you liberate the Glitchers stronghold, the girl you talk to has some really neat flavor text.\nYou also might even feel a bit bad for murdering Offworld Security given their philosophy on non-lethal combat and anytime you take a mission for them, you bring a non-lethal weapon.\n\nMy only big complaint is. . around an hour of gameplay or so, without fail, the game begins to drop from 60FPS to 30, then 20, then lower. Not sure what is up with that. . but. A simple restart fixes it. . and since the game just drops you in. . it's only a mild annoyance -- but should be fixed.\n\nI'd love to see more variation in ship design and maybe even space stations for some additional variation, rather than just constantly attacking ships.\n\nIt's also hard to tell which environmental objects may give you cover (which you figure out eventaully ). . but some sort of lighting system would help that.\n\nI was also a bit surprised that bumping into a target ship doesn't trigger any alarms. That'd make that aspect a bit more engage. Maybe some ships would and some wouldn't, etc\n\nI could talk further about the gameplay (there are probably loads of reviews for that) but there are some other reviews for that, this were the small things that stuck out to me.", "timestamp_created": 1510133152, "timestamp_updated": 1510388598, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36352243": {"recommendationid": "36352243", "author": {"steamid": "76561198211347772", "num_games_owned": 124, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1622, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510656502}, "language": "english", "review": "game is fun, lots of ways to take down ur enemies, heck yea", "timestamp_created": 1510089107, "timestamp_updated": 1510089166, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36333970": {"recommendationid": "36333970", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001653289", "num_games_owned": 457, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 4135, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 175, "last_played": 1514304005}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm not sure that I can recommend Heat Signature quite enough. \n\nGet it.

In that game, when you die, you INSTANTLY get to try again. No loading screens, no fuss, nothing. In Heat Signature, if you screw up in a mission you get knocked unconscious (and thrown out an airlock if someone finds you in time) a process so slow that the developers gave you a fast-forward button to make up for it. Something very similar applies if you succeed in a mission -- you either have to fly the captured ship home (which can be done on autopilot, but still takes time) or manually pilot your pod home (which takes time and attention towards the end since you have to decelerate to dock.)\n\nI suppose it's possible that when you get much deeper into the game than I am now there might be some purpose to this downtime -- maybe people come and attack you while you're in transit.

To sum it up quickly for you this game will get boring if you don't like to experiment. This game is really just a sandbox that you should experience by experimenting with weapons and tools to try and figure out how you want your objectives completed. I believe there's 4 ship styles which is pretty cool but I hope that Tom will continue to support his game with new content. So far he's put out a good image by adding the small halloween update so hopefully he keeps supporting this game and trys new things. The music isn't bad by any means but there's not enough tracks and a couple of the tracks just aren't that inspiring and feel like they're missing soul and creativity, though there still are good tracks. Gameplay, obviously the important one, is good. The item system is nice and the only thing that differentiates an experienced character with a newer one is what items you have. Perhaps more RPG elements would help this game? I am not sure. The story is basically a sandbox as well since you choose who you want to play as, funnily enough if one of your guys gets captured while trying to save his sister you can end up playing as the former's partner and try to rescue your partner that way he can rescue his sister. \n\nOverall this game is doing something new which regardless, deserves recognition for. The gameplay is satisfying and you really need to experiment to truly experience this game. The visuals are nice and the characters breathe and act human if you pay attention closely enough. The music can be improved and I hope more content is added in the future for the longevity. $15 is a little steep IMO for this game so I'm hoping that Tom continues to support this game so players will be inclined to keep this game or purchase it for the first time. As of now I'll give it a 3/5, It's definitely above average especially for an indie game and it sets itself out with awesome gameplay and good ideas, but it just needs more content from the dev.

Don't get too atached to your player characters, you are expected to retire them after they have a bunch of missions under their belt (and lots of cash for superior gear).

A google search and some tinkering resolved that, though. (If you are having slowdown problems that go away after restarting the game, this worked for me, set the SleepMargin value to 15: https://steamcommunity.com/app/268130/discussions/0/1496741765123664804/ )\n\n\nMy only complaint is that there really isn't much depth to this game - you see everything it has to offer in the first few hours (every enemy type, every item type, etc) and the procedurally created environments seem like a bit of a shortcut around the developers creating thoroughly thought out maps. I think at least for the defector missions they should have created static layouts that challenge the player. If you get a layout in a defector mission that is particulary difficult, you can just restart endlessly until you get an easier layout. \n\nBut anywho, this is quite a brilliant game. The developers dump you into this world of violent space piracy with only minimal training, kit and cash, and thats the brilliance of it. I'm almost 40 hours in (and nearing completion) and I'm still learning new and creative ways of dealing with the obstacles put before me with the equipment that I have on hand. As you go on you get much better at doing more with less, and coming out victorious from an enemy ship with a loadout that you couldn't imagine taking on this sort of a challenge with before is rewarding and fun.

A couple of guards in a nearby huddle start to raise their heads to look at the blur of motion they can see but Amber will be long gone by the time they get over to the airlock to find nothing amiss.\n\nRounding a corner Amber has just enough time to see the automated turret before slamming on her trusty stealth shield, cloaking her in shadows rendering her all but invisible from the front. A second group of guards are standing by the turret, both equally oblivious as she hugs the walls, snatching a key card off one of their belts before slipping backwards through the door they were guarding. \n\nHer onboard HUD flashes up a local map interfaced with the ship internals - there's some valuable loot in a crate guarded by more turrets and guards up ahead, with no-one inside. If only she could walk through this bulkhead she'd have it made - and so she activates her Visitor teleporter, appearing in the room and quickly opening up the cargo container to grab a key cloner - this could come in handy. She only has a second to appreciate the find before the Visitor abruptly yanks her back to her previous position.\n\nEnough with the side objectives - the target is in a room up ahead with three innocent guards and a turret. Amber swallows and readies all her gadgets - this is going to be tricky. Activating the slipstream and stealth shield, Amber fires up her Visitor and appears behind the target, almost directly on top of him. She slams a prepared glitch trap set to outside the ship and backs up, trusting to the Visitor and Shield to keep herself safe as she directly interfaces with her breaching pod remotely, detaching it from the ship. A couple of seconds of intense piloting later and Sojourn is unconscious, secure inside the pod and restrained by the catching mechanism.\n\nRight. Now how do I get out of here?\n\n-------\n\nHeat Signature is an amazingly addictive little space roguelite game where you get to, with ample use of the pause function, act like a ninja obsessed with futuristic toys or a gun toting lunatic breacher who leaves a trail of bodies in his wake.

I've sunk hundreds of hours into the flash version of Binding of Issac, and then I sank hundreds of hours into Binding of Issac: Rebirth as well. Once upon a time I had a 10% ascension rate on nethack.alt.org which is not record breaking, but not too shabby either. I either really, really love games, or drop them after a couple of hours, and whereas I used to think how much I like a game was based on it being hard or action based one of the things I value above all else is how consistent the rules are and if I have the tools to bend them so I can succeed.\n\nWith that said, I can say (with my very particularly tastes and my very particular expectations of a game) Heat Signature is absolutely a hands down great game. The title looks at first like Hotline Miami, a top down twitch shooter, but the pause mechanic in Heat Sig allows you to do arbitrarily complex actions from the pause screen. Given the opportunity to deliberate, choose a course of action, and carefully execute it without the stress of live action makes the game play almost like a puzzler when the shit hits the fan- which happens on almost every mission.\n\nIt reminds me a [i]lot[/i] of Nethack where you're thinking between turns in the face of assured death- however Heat Sig seems as though the entire game was made to be built [i]around[/i] moments of assured death and trying to escape them, rather than games like Nethack that just [i]have[/i] plenty of moments of assured death where the lucky, brave, and exceptionally knowledgable can sometimes can eek their way through.\n\nThe creator has described this game in the genre of \"Things Going Wrong\", and I've also heard him describe the ideal situation in a game as a \"Salvageable Catastrophe\". Nothing plays with your emotions more than being completely screwed and seconds from capture or death, only to end up making it out alive by hook or by crook. And sometimes \"crook\" means accidentally blowing a spacecraft in half so you only have to deal with the smaller, more manageable half. Or hell, intentionally doing it, it worked out fine last time and your hands are sort of tied.\n\nI also called out the original Binding of Issac because the original flash BoI had a very restrictive set of rules that governed it, but an expert in these rules could play them off each other and achieve almost any goal by manipulating them directly. My go-to example of an expert tearing that game apart is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGhjlGPzT0k, where the game world's opportunities are wide open and careful deliberation allows him to tear the game apart to his advantage. There's the [i]game[/i] of shooting enemies and getting powerups, then there's the [i]metagame[/i] of maximizing your ability to get power ups and items.\n\nIn Heat Sig the metagame isn't quite this intense (if the game relies on hidden rulesets for item pools, then I don't know it), but the game mechanics allow for [i]exceptionally[/i] creative problem solving to circumvent enemies or problems on their face through a careful manipulation of the game world. The [i]game[/i] is about shooting enemies and capturing bad guys, but the [i]metagame[/i] is about warping the game world to make this easy. This includes a variety of things I've done on purpose (assassinating the pilot so the ship I'm on can't dock at an enemy base and capture me along with it) to and endless number of things I've stumbled on by accident (the aforementioned tearing a ship in half mid-fight, the remaining enemies flew off into the distance and I could pilot the smaller half back to a friendly base as there was no one left to fight on it). The game rewards creativity exceptionally well, and only a few times have I thought \"maybe this will work\" and been disappointed, and I was usually disappointed because the off the wall tactic worked too well and obliterated the guy I was trying to capture or send my rescue-ee off into deep space too fast for me to go and catch him.\n\nIn short, I am really taken with Heat Signature and advertise it to anyone who will listen. There are a bunch of other great mechanics that are worth investigating on their own for how they work just so well (the permadeath mechanic, timed levels, the limited inventory space vs the variety of enemy types, and the tradeoffs between teleporter mechanics), but suffice to say I just powered through my first galaxy and will be back to play a second galaxy. I seriously hope an expansion is a planned or in the works, because the game feels like it scratches the surface of what a well realized set of game mechanics can be used for.\n\n\nAddendum:\n\nI forgot to mention the cons to the game, which any good review would give. The first and biggest drawback is that some of the space ships you find yourself on have amazingly busy tilesets visually, and that makes it very hard to identify what is going on and where enemies are. My first sit down with the game I actually had to take a break because my eyes started hurting trying to parse the glitcher ship tilesets- I may be a wimp about this with my ageing eyes but this should probably be looked at.\n\nAnother notable issue is that there is a memory leak somewhere, and the game will slow to a crawl after hours of play. It's a testament to the game that despite individual levels being 10 minute spaceship hijacking vignettes, a memory leak that shows up after hours of play is kind of a big problem. Closing the game and re-opening clears it, but seriously. This isn't amateur hour, this detracts from an otherwise stellar game. The game stutters when you return back to an asteroid, so I'm guessing the interior never gets cleared from memory collectly but re-loaded on each return.\n\nThe last element is that the larger main story and the \"Galaxy\" itself feels like it needs a better narrative. The small procedurally generated storylines of missions don't hook into at the larger scope of the \"Galaxy\" much at all, and the disconnect is disappointing when you sink 30 hours over 2 weeks into the game (cough).\n\nTo add a final note to the matter of the main storyline, [spoiler]the game ending is very disappointing. It ends with a sort of \"but you did all that work for nothing\" twist that is clever, but it also is akin to a disappointing ending you shouldget get on easy mode with better endings available once you've completed the game on Hard. The game offers no evidence that this is the case. I'll probably go through the process of trying again, freeing all the asteroids, and then actually following through and completing all the defector missions. I hope by that time, if completionism isn't rewarded at present, that some sort of better ending is patched into the game by then[/spoiler].", "timestamp_created": 1508703732, "timestamp_updated": 1508703732, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497512", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35930568": {"recommendationid": "35930568", "author": {"steamid": "76561198133984504", "num_games_owned": 61, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 250, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508551515}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is super fun and makes you feel like a total badass.

Over the course of the game, the player controls several different mercenaries for hire, who are working for an independent client, trying to liberate space stations from the control of the factions, with the ultimate goal of ending the war. Each of your characters also has a personal mission, which could be getting revenge on someone who hurt a family member, or stealing a valuable item to pay off a debt.\n\nAfter accepting a contract from the mission board of a friendly space station, you\u2019ll pilot a small shuttle through space, and dock with a larger spaceship. You then control your character from an overhead perspective, as you wander around the spaceship interior towards your objective, fighting or evading enemy guards along the way. Each ship has a unique, procedurally generated layout. Action is real time, but you can pause to assess the situation and make a plan.\n\nContract objectives include killing or capturing a specific target, rescuing a prisoner, stealing a piece of technology, or hijacking the ship (which requires you to kill or knock out every guard on board). Some contracts are given a further twist with clauses, including bloodless (don\u2019t kill anybody), silent (don\u2019t set off an alarm) or enigma (don\u2019t leave any living witnesses). Failing a clause doesn\u2019t prevent you from completing the mission, but it reduces the amount of money you earn.\n\nIf guards see or hear you they will raise the alarm, which triggers the pilot to return to base. If you're still on board when they get there, you'll be captured, but you can kill or knock out the pilot to stop the journey, giving you time to complete the mission. Some ships have turrets that can kill you, but guards will just knock you out and throw you out the airlock. You\u2019ll then have a few seconds whilst floating in space, to remote control your shuttle and catch yourself before you die of suffocation.\n\nIf your character is killed or captured, you start a new character with no progress lost in the overall campaign. Your new character\u2019s personal mission might be to rescue your old character, and if successful, you can play as the old character again. You can have four characters active that you can switch between at a friendly space station.\n\nThe really enjoyable part of the game comes from the variety of gadgets available for use on missions. You can either buy them from a friendly space station, or find them in cargo holds aboard spaceships. This review would probably be a mile long if I tried to list all the cool stuff you can do, but here are a few of my favourites.\n-\tUse a crashbeam to deactivate a turret, or a subverter to make it shoot your enemies.\n-\tSome guards have energy shields protecting them from all types of damage. Deactivate it with the crashbeam, or use the subverter to cause their own bullets to bounce back at them.\n-\tThe slipstream slows time, allowing you to attack multiple guards before they can react.\n-\tUse the sidewinder to teleport past a group of guards, or teleport directly behind one for an easy attack.\n-\tThe swapper lets you switch places with a guard. Swap with one who just fired at you, to kill them with their own bullet.\n-\tMost spaceships have several internal doors that are locked, requiring you to collect keycards, held by guards. Or, you could just use the keycard cloner to make a copy from a safe range, even if there\u2019s a wall between you and the guard.\n-\tGlitch traps are mines that let you set a teleport destination for any guard who steps on it. Set the destination outside the ship, so they suffocate to death.\n\nSome guards also have special equipment, including strong armour that can only be penetrated by special weapons, and heat sensors which alert them to your presence even if you're behind them or in another room. Some can teleport to the location of suspicious sounds and some have bombs linked to their heartbeat which instantly detonate if you kill them. There\u2019s a strong tactical, almost puzzle like, element to the game, figuring out the best way to use your gadgets to bypass each ship\u2019s security.\n\nSome of the funniest moments are when your plans go wrong, and you have to quickly adapt. One time I used a crashhammer (powerful non-lethal melee weapon) to knock out my target, who I had to capture alive. The problem is, this weapon hits with so much force, my target flew down a corridor and smashed through an exterior window, sucking us both out into space. I only just managed to catch us both with my shuttle, before we died. I had a similar experience with a glitch trap, which doesn\u2019t teleport your character, but apparently it does teleport people that you\u2019re trying to rescue.\n \nOf course, no game is perfect. Enemy AI has a few flaws. Often the best tactic to use against groups of enemies, is to ambush them one by one on their patrol routes. However, it feels strange that the other guards don\u2019t think \u201chmm, that guy has been gone for a while, maybe something is wrong?\u201d. And whilst guards will react if they see corpses, they don\u2019t seem to react to blood stains or weapons lying on the floor. Its also unbelievable that each ship seems to only have one pilot. Once you\u2019ve dealt with him, you have infinite time to complete the mission. You can even leave the ship, head back to a space station, buy some new gear, go back to the ship, and no other guards will have taken over flying the ship while you were away.\n\nAnd although it took me 18 hours to finish the campaign, I think I\u2019d seen everything by the halfway point. Once you\u2019re powerful enough to eliminate one of the factions, the rest of the game is basically just repeating the same mission types over and over again until you liberate enough space stations to take out the remaining factions. Whilst those missions are still fun, I was kind of hoping for a new type of mission or a new piece of late game tech to freshen things up again.\n\nOverall, Heat Signature is one of the best games I\u2019ve played this year, and I strongly recommend everyone to check it out.

Lots of fun, Kinda bland, Kinda fun. \nLet's go over pros and cons.\n\nPros:\nGameplay -> This game feels great when you're good at it. Killing everyone who stands in your path, or stealing something on a huge ship without being seen by anyone. But that Is what can bore you. If you play to win, it becomes less and less fun (This applied to me with the last hour or two). If you play to lose however, the game becomes so much better. Doing the hardest mission with just a wrench may be difficult (almost impossible) but if you are insanely lucky you might complete the mission, just.\n \nMusic -> I'm not that much of a music lover. But the music doesn't make me want to kill myself, sooo, it will pass for me.\n\nGraphics -> It can run on my shit PC and still looks fairly polished. So I guess this will pass as well.\n\nTension -> You know when you get to a hyped up final boss in an RPG or loads of people are counting on you for something? Well I felt that way several times (especially early game) during my time playing Heat signature so far. Few games do this for me, I guess that's a plus.\n\nAchievements -> This is the first (and most likely only) game I have got all the achievements for (I spent 4 hours getting \"one careful owner). The achievements gave me a bit of a drive to play more of the game and gave me a few ideas to have some extra fun. They are quite plentiful (46 in total) and they aren't stupidly difficult (apart from one careful owner)\n\nCons:\nGlitches -> Many glitches; Many fixes. Not sure where to stand on this one but hey. I played through the game without losing my save, or getting trapped, so I don't particularly care.\n\nNo workshop -> Grrr. If there was workshop I could easily get another 30 hours out of this game. It will most likely come in the future, but it stays as a con for now. [This could get rid of the boredom after many hours]\n\nBoredom -> I already spoke about this earlier. If you try too much, or you play the game carefully. You will get bored (eventually). Luckily everything is here for you to have the fun you really want.\n\nPrice -> Not so sure on this one. I definitely got my money's worth but a lot of people haven't. If you can see yourself playing this game for 10+ hours go for it. If not wait for a sale or something.\n\n\nWell that shall do for now.

I was a big fan of the developer's previous game \"Gunpoint,\" and although there are some highlights in Heat Signature, it missed the mark for me even though this is essentially my favorite type of game (rogue-like space strategy).\n\nStory:\nThe galaxy is at war, and your goal is to end the war by... killing a lot of people.  But don't worry, as you slowly take over the entire galaxy, no one does anything to stop you or get back at you for murdering all those people.  Or even lock the front doors on their space ships.\n\nThe personal missions of each character were a nice touch, especially if you've lost a character, since their parent/partner/etc can train up to get them back.  But ultimately, and for no apparent reason, every station is filled with cloned wrench-wielding super-spy assassins. \n\nThe ending was interesting, and added more than I expected, but frankly it only took away from the achievement of uniting the galaxy and did not leave a good final impression.\n\nThe dialogue was good, and I particularly enjoyed the conversation with Geneva Stonelock, but in general there wasn't much use of dialogue or character development.\n\nGameplay:\nIt was fun to figure out for the first couple of hours, since the game doesn't spoon feed you the mechanics, but ultimately once I figured it out, I could beat an \"audacious\" mission without trouble using a brand new character.  If a character ever dies, it's no big deal, because there's no \"punishment\" for losing a character, and every character is destined to be \"retired\" anyway, and they are only unique in the items they carry.  I ended up keeping one character in reserve for the final two faction liberations, but by the second one, the deadly, teleporting, armored guards looked more like stooges trying to keep up.\n\nYou spend a lot of your time flying around meaninglessly in a small ship going between your base and target ships.  It would have been much more fun if there were any weight to this time, but the only mildly engaging element, docking, could easily be avoided with a cheap ship that auto-docks.  If there had been more docking choices, such as a second dock that was advantageous but you had to fly through ship defenses, maybe that would have been fun.  Or fuel. Or ships hunting you.  But as the game stands, you can take your time and bounce off the side of a ship 15 times and no one cares.  No one fires at you, no one sounds an alarm, nothing. \n\nThere's no sense of urgency and you can probably finish the whole game by taking easy missions, and then doing the 4 samey hijackings to finally eliminate each faction.  I didn't go that route, because the game is actually pretty easy after the first couple hours, and then it's just a grind because you have to retire your well-equipped characters and then start all over from scratch 12-18 times I'm guessing.\n\nThe time spent in battle is quite trivial once you've unlocked the hammer.  Seriously, why are the two most powerful weapons a wrench and a hammer?  You can walk up to a group of 4 guards with guns (maybe more) and hammer all of them unconscious before they can even get a shot off.  Your hammer has an 8 meter range! \n\nYou can also knock out a few guards and then pick up all of their guns.  Since the cooldown time applies to each gun, you can just fire gun 1, switch to gun 2, fire that one, and just keep switching as you mow down a grouping of bad guys as though you have an auto-aiming machine gun.\n\nThere are several types of missions, but the gameplay is almost always the same, regardless. Kill the captain first to stop the alarm, then do whatever.  In fact, I basically killed the captain first then took over the ship 90% of the time, because the enemy ship can automatically set a course for your base, but your ship can't for some reason, and it allowed me to skip the \"now fly home slowly\" mini-game.\n\nI liked the \"damaged pod\" minigame, but since you can pause to see what quicktime events you need to perform, it was also trivial.\n\nLack of Polish:\nThere are lots of little oversights, especially in the UI.  I'm playing in 4k so some of that usually pops up, but these seemed like general issues, such as labels covering up objectives, or buttons overlapping each other (so for example pressing \"back\" may take you into a mission because there was another button under the back button and the game didn't shut off collisions on the hidden button). \n\nIn the mission select screen, I would choose missions based on the gear I had, and the pause button is what's used to brings up your gear, but if you pause in the mission select screen it just overlays your gear on top of the missions and you get an ugly pile of unrelated text.\n\nYou can also teleport items to yourself while you're unconscious, sometimes ships collide and sometimes they don't, etc.\n\nConclusion:\nCertainly, there are things to enjoy here, and I'm glad people seem to like it and the dev is (hopefully) making good money.  I look forward to their next game.  I just wish Heat Signature had come out 6 months later, with better combat balance, a more polished UI, a sense of urgency (like FTL's encroaching fleet), some character variation (maybe \"quirks\" like in Rogue Legacy or Darkest Dungeon), a better tie in for the liberation missions (where you play with an assigned set of limited gear), and a sense that anything matters.  Killing lots of people doesn't matter, skipping missions that seem to easy or hard doesn't matter, ramming your ship into another ship generally doesn't matter, getting \"spaced\" doesn't matter, getting captured doesn't matter, even dying doesn't really matter.  This could have been a great game, but I can't really think of a reason to recommend it other than that other people seem to really like it. \n\nIt's my hope that the developer sees this and uses it to improve Heat Signature or a future game, although I'm clearly in the minority so maybe I'm just wrong ; p\n", "timestamp_created": 1508552986, "timestamp_updated": 1508552986, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 27, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.668360", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35877931": {"recommendationid": "35877931", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067007103", "num_games_owned": 101, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 819, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511629060}, "language": "english", "review": "Heat signature Where do I start with this game?\n\nI found this game in the \"backyard of steam\" and I found a treasure.\n\nThis game is made by the studio that developed GUNPOINT and the studio has delivered to my expctations with the promise of a \"space smuggler/Han Solo-sim\".\n\nThe game is heavily inspired by their previous project gunpoint and hotline miami, adding to the mix some roguelite elements such as randomly generated galaxies, ships, missions, and the weapons/explosives/trinkets.\n\nYou play as a series of different free-agents for a rebel organization whose purpose is to eliminate  4 diferent factions, however every agent has also their own personal mission which promotes replayability and gives some meaning to the run saving a captured friend/stealing a secret weapon/complete their vendetta against someone that killed a loved one for you.\n\nThe game is played on a eagle view perspective like hotline miami and combines the madness and puzzle like rooms of such game with the tactic and slow-mo mode of gunpoint.\n\n+Pros:\n\nHuge replayability\n\nEasy to learn hard to master\n\nBeautifull music and good lore\n\n- Cons:\n\nCan be repetitive when you start with a fresh agent (collecting funds/weapons/trinkets for your run)\n\nYou need a mouse to play this game no excuses about it.\n\nNo trading cards/level editor =(  (at the time I have wrote this review 21/10/2017)\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1508549333, "timestamp_updated": 1508549333, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35877868": {"recommendationid": "35877868", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971115155", "num_games_owned": 550, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 931, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 35, "last_played": 1513209930}, "language": "english", "review": "If the objective doesn't require my son to be stealthy, then he either kills or maims everyone on board and steals the ship.

For example, if you have a 'leave no witnesses' mission, and you've left behind a few guards you can't kill, you can blink up to a capture target, activate a stealth shield and toggle vision to bait the nearby guards and your capture target to a room. Then you can throw a wrench at the window to suck all of you into space, and with your remote control pod you can scoop up yourself and the capture target. This kind of creative problem solving is very fun, and is the soul and spirit of the game. The generated worlds and missions leads to emergent story telling keeps the game fresh longer, but at times can seem grindy. The flavor text on weapons and items is humerous and refreshing. \n\nCons: AI seems a bit wonky at times. Guards on alert won't alert nearby guards, for example. The pause and swap items mechanic is intended, but leads to an 'infinite hands' syndrome, where the player can blink in, pause, subvert one guard's shields, pause, fire his gun at a target, pause, throw his gun at a target, pause, switch to longblade, pause, dash and kill with longblade, dash and kill with shortblade, pause, throw longblade, pause, and blink away all in about 0.2 seconds of game time.

You pick from one of four characters who happen to be sitting at a bar in space, and take them from humble beginnings with a wrench and one other unique item to being one of the most well-equipped thieves/assassins/hijackers in the galaxy.  The game serves you up a large array of missions of varying difficulties, some with special optional objectives that increase your pay, so there's almost always something for players of every stripe, be they stealthy or aggressive.\n\nThere are some small problems, though.  While liberating stations via the galaxy map adds an element of persistence to the game, it really only affects what you can buy from shops.  You have a stash you can send spare items to, but once your character dies, so does the stash.  This is further complicated by the fact that your character can only sustain so many injuries before your survival time drops to zero, and there is no way to heal yourself between missions.  One minor mistake takes 6 seconds off your character's initial 30-second survival clock, until you hit 0 seconds and the next hit kills you.\n\nThis implementation of permadeath is quite frustrating.  The game doesn't throw so much top-tier loot at you that it would be unbalanced to be able to stash some items for your next character - in fact, it would add a sense of choice between taking your best gear with you and risking its loss, or keeping it safe for someone else in case the next heist is your last.  The other option would be adding the ability to recover your survival clock for a hefty fee.  You couldn't do it every time you got hit, and you'd have to choose between health and buying new gear, but it would ease the sting of permadeath.  Having to start a new character and farm Easy and Medium missions (there is a notable gap between Medium and Hard) just to get some decent equipment is just busy work.\n\nPerhaps most counter-intuitive of all is that the game drastically slows your progression towards your next liberation if you play one character too much.  It seems to think that people are more interested in playing as part of a cast of geared-up characters rather than just one - but this option would only really be attractive if you could somehow swap items between characters. I'd happily build one guy for stealth, one for offense, etc., but I'm not allowed, so I might as well just hoard all my stuff on one mercenary - or at least I would, if doing so didn't literally decrease my progression speed by a massive 95% with no way to remedy this.\n\nHeatSig is best when you're rolling with a fully-geared character, using a mix of teleportation, stealth, and melee weapons to carve up your enemies.  There's a handy pause feature as well that allows you to stop time whenever you like to consider your next move, or group of moves.  There's nothing like planning a sequence in your head in the pause screen and then carrying it out exactly as you like it - and I don't think I'll ever get tired of sucking myself into space by shooting out a window as soon as I've completed my mission.\n\nThere's also the option to complete a personal mission for each of your procedurally-generated characters.  A nice touch, and definitely something to look forward to as you progress.\n\nLiberating space stations also unlocks Defector missions, which are played with a character other than your own who always starts with the same weapon set.  It's a little slice of Hotline Miami tucked into HeatSig, though the layout of the ship you're invading changes every time you restart, so you can somewhat cheese the Defector missions into giving you a favorable spread, though the number of enemies and their gear remains mostly the same.  Still, it's a good, consequence-free way to take a break, and more effective practice than the built-in practice mode.\n\nAll told, there's a huge diversity of gameplay stuffed into what is actually a very tight, refined gameplay loop.  It's a game you can play for ten minutes or several hours at a time and have fun for the entirety of your time.  There's no penalty for simply failing missions either, so you're really encouraged to experiment and see what tactics work for you.

And what is this game all about?\n\nI've read some comparisons - FTL meets Hotline Miami, for instance, which admittedly feels wrong to me, but honestly, I liked both games and I love this one, so if you, too, like both the more tactical/strategic FTL and the more rythmic, frantic Hotline Miami, maybe you'll be happy with this, too. To me, it's more like Ronin or Gunpoint meets The Masterplan with FTLs aesthetics (and a suitable space scenario). \n\nIt's essentially a top-down shooter made for Mouse and Keyboard, with puzzle elements, random loot and heavy roguelite elements. I won't spoil the start of the story, but at some point you'll be playing as one of a number of more-or-less randomly generated characters, trying to fulfill missions to sow chaos and liberate space stations while also trying to earn money to get intel on a (also generated, character-related) personal story mission.\n\nYou do that by flying around in a pod (having a mission is optional, but makes sense) and dock that pod to the ship containing your mission objective (or other, random ships that appear around you) and then walking through the rooms of the ship, using melee weapons and guns to stun or kill members of the crew, hack or break sentry guns, unlock doors with keycards and applying a wide range of interesting gadgets, such as projectile-reflecting or stealth shields, time-manipulating devices and various kinds of teleporters to get to your objective.\n\nYou can always Pause the game and do a few things from there, such as change your equipment, check ranges and strategize, and even if unpaused the game will significantly slow down for critical moments (such as being spotted or while taking aim). Also, anything lying around (in opened crates or from downed enemies) can be instantly teleported to you for direct use. Convenient!\n\nThe controls are simple, intuitive and the pacing and feel is really great, enabling the kind of crazy antics that you read about in most reviews (and while not necessarily \"easy\" to pull off, they get astonishingly doable with some practice). While the game is very simple upfront, it is built relatively complex and allows for a lot of the things you'd expect (and some you probably don't!): Turning opponents shields on themselves, turning sentry guns, using airlocks or breakable windows to have people sucked into space - it's even possible to board another ship and control that and start shooting at the ship your mission target is in! And if you find yourself sucked into space - you can remote control your pod and catch yourself (and your target, if need be).\n\nEquipment can be found on opponents and in cargo containers, as well as bought at a shop (which will gain additional stock as you liberate stations). You can only carry a set amount of equipment pieces (but you have a character-based, unlimited stash), but aren't restricted by type (so you could go all guns, or no weapons, or anything like that...). Equipment can come in various forms: Melee weapons are unlimited, normal guns use common ammo (which is tracked separately) and most other stuff has charges, either one-time charges (once spent, they're spent, and if the item reaches zero, it's gone for good), rechargeable (limited charges per mission, but refills automatically when you land on your station) or even auto-recharging (recharges during the mission). Items also have attributes such as concussive (non-lethal, required to capture people, if need be), armor-piercing, silent or some such, and modifiers such as long-range or high-capacity for some of the gadgets.\n\nAll of that, and money, is character-bound, meaning: Character dies, everything is gone - money, equipped stuff, anything in the stash. Only liberated stations remain. If you don't want to continue a character right now, you can switch between characters (but they will only have access to their own stash and inventory). You can switch back later.\nOnce your character has completed their personal mission and/or liberated some stations, they become too famous and less apt at liberating stations. You can then retire those characters, permanently removing them from your roster of playable characters. They get a nice plaque with their name and detailling everything this living legend accomplished (stations liberated, personal story fulfilled) and you get to pick one of their items, and a name for it, and that item (with that name, and a reference to your player name in the item text) can from there on out be found by any of your or your steam friends characters. A nice legacy.\n\nIn the end, it's a game about planning, and failing plans, and improvisation, and using all the tools at your disposal. It can be stressful, but incredibly awesome as well. It's a game of daring, audacious acts and epic wins, a game where I found myself gleefully hacking a sentry gun to kill some enemy guards, but one of them surviving and sounding the alarm (which starts a timer), then using a slipstream (time-manipulating device) and a sidewinder (teleporter that needs a clear route, however convoluted it may be) to get to the ships captain to knock him out (cancelling the alarm timer) - but alerting too many guards in the process, so now I was stuck in some corner of the ship, with some weapons and a visitor (a teleporter that can teleport through walls, but teleports you back after two seconds). So I did what any reasonable person would do: Used the visitor to teleport into a room with a window, fire one shot against a wall. Get returned to the original location, while guards swarm the room to investigate the noise. Use another charge of the visitor to teleport to just outside the room, in the hallway - I think one or two of the guards still saw me as I took aim to blow the window out. Boom. Half a dozen guards sucked into space. The mission suddenly got a whole lot easier.", "timestamp_created": 1508190365, "timestamp_updated": 1508535421, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35781300": {"recommendationid": "35781300", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024504515", "num_games_owned": 85, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 846, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509202553}, "language": "english", "review": "Fast paced yet deeply strategic.

The first game or two I did not know what to make of it, it was all sinking in... that said:\n\nThis game is brilliant.  I've been playing games since 1984 and I can count on one hand the amount of times I've been inspired this much by a single game.  1) Xcom UFO Defense (the old microprose version), 2) The first Metal Gear game 3) Final Fantasy for the NES 4) Faster Than Light (FTL) 5) Heat Signature.   \n\nYou play a bandit/hero/terrorist/villian/assasin/person trying to get by/um... it's complicated... who boards ships, does horrible things to the crew under seemingly impossible conditions, and somehow makes it out alive.  It is all under the umbrella of you trying to \"free\" space stations but really who cares about that. The story takes a waaaaaaaaay back seat to the game play here. \n\nThe gameplay: (an example)\n1) take the mission, you gotta kill some dude on some ship, with very little time to do it. Oh by the way he has a shield, and you don't have anything yet to penetrate a shield.\n2) fly out to the ship as fast as you can, the clock is ticking on this mission (not all missions have timers)\n3) you meet and board the ship undetected, lucky for you there is a skeleton crew, but time is running out because you fail at piloting your little pod. \n4) You don't have time for keys, so you get past a keyed door by using your swapper which literally swaps you with your target. \n5) You drop two guards with your wrench and pistol, the gunshot has alerted your target who comes running at you, shield lit up. \n6) you turn with your pistol and blow out the window behind you as your target enters the room, sucking you both out into the vacuum of space. \n7) you remote pilot your pod to pick you up before you die, your target is not so lucky. \n\nSee there are a million ways to complete a mission, you can be a door-kicker and come in like a typhoon, or you can be a sneaky little ninja who drags the bodies of his victims back to the pod leaving no trace he was ever there. \n\nLoot in the game is fantastic, and say you want to jump aboard a random ship that happens to be bumbling past you on the way to your mission, just to check out its cargo???

For example:\n\nYou have taken a rescue mission. You get onto the ship and use your teleporters to get to the target. You pick up the target. You walk out of the room, screw up and get spotted. There are now ~ 7 guards with armor chasing after you with guns, and you don't have any weapons that are armor piercing. You see a window nearby. when examining the achievements, you noticed that there was an achievement for chucking a rescue target out of a window. You run to the window and proceed to throw your target out of the window, and are sucked out into space. (Along with your target, and any guards who were close to you.) You remote control your ship, and catch yourself, and the target, and proceed to your home base. \n\nI hope that Heat Signature gets the award.", "timestamp_created": 1507983897, "timestamp_updated": 1511660002, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35714632": {"recommendationid": "35714632", "author": {"steamid": "76561198135085530", "num_games_owned": 2980, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 1579, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507977467}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041e\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430. \u042d\u0442\u043e \u0435\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u0431\u044b \u043c\u0430\u043d\u044c\u044f\u043d\u0438 \u0438\u0437 \u041c\u0430\u044f\u043c\u0438 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u043a\u043e\u0441\u043c\u043e\u043f\u0438\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0430\u043c\u0438 ^_^", "timestamp_created": 1507977620, "timestamp_updated": 1507977620, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35713565": {"recommendationid": "35713565", "author": {"steamid": "76561198386470374", "num_games_owned": 3, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 724, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510063045}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041a\u0440\u0443\u0442\u0430\n", "timestamp_created": 1507974410, "timestamp_updated": 1507974410, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35703344": {"recommendationid": "35703344", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032868512", "num_games_owned": 1221, "num_reviews": 148, "playtime_forever": 186, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508429114}, "language": "english", "review": "Hotline Miami meets FTL!

I enjoyed all of the 32 hours I spent liberating 2 galaxies in order to get all the achievements. This is because the game gives you plenty of different ways to pull off impossible-cool stunts during your missions. The tools, opponents and systems enable a ton of fun creative options for you, and if you learn to use them all you'll have a great time. The writing is also witty. I especially like how the in game practice mode tells you \u201chow to be cool\u201d - that's exactly how you'll feel after neutralizing a room full of alerted guards through creative use of teleporting and abusing item cooldowns.\n\n\tThat's the good, now for the bad. While the game does have more than enough variety, it still suffers a little from small variety related problems that if fixed, would make it much better, and get me playing the game some more.\n\n\tFor example, once you've done one stronghold liberation mission, there are 3 more you need to do that are exactly the same level of difficulty even if the load-out of the enemies are different. It would be nice if the difficulty of these missions ramped up somehow, or otherwise changed. It makes me feel like I'm just doing the same thing 4 times at the end of the game. I've already done a lot of hijack missions anyway, so letting me bail out without neutralizing the entire crew actually makes them easier.\n\n\tMore difference in guard kit would also be appreciated. What equipment guards can use feels really limited compared to what the player can use and the lack of variety does make the game feel a little more monotonous then it should. Where are the guards with grenades, front facing shields, EVA suits, machine-guns, heat signature masks, etc?\n\n\tI'd also like to see different responses for alerts. Right now when you alert a crew the ship just flies back to base, but there are other things ships could do, like call for reinforcements or rescue. It doesn't really seem that interesting or balanced that you can just disable a ships engines and get infinite time to do your mission (after which the ship and crew just drift, forever). The guards should be able to call for a ship to rescue them. If you hijack a ship, the faction should probably send another ship to figure out what happened to it.\n\n\tThe map feels really static. Allegedly these factions are at war with one another, but you'll never see a station change hands except when you capture one yourself. This might be one of the reasons why some players feel the game is grindy.\n\n\tEvery faction uses the same system of escalating security levels between the airlock and objective which just feels really weird and makes every ship feel alike after a while.\n\n\tWhile the game has some neat interacting system mechanics, there are a few things obviously missing. For example, you can't enter a ship by throwing yourself through a broken window, you can't shoot out a window from space, you can't use breech grenades to enter a ship from space, and you can't cross a breech from one internal section of a ship to another.\n\n\tThe interface could be better. The layout is weird, with bits of important information placed on sides and in corners, where it's least visible. \n\n\tThe layout also moves things around when it really should be fix them in place.\n\n\tIt seems like sometimes pressing f does the same thing pressing e does, and I'm still not sure exactly why or when.\n\n\tGraphically, the background tiles could make guards pop out a bit more. Ships are very obviously tile based and there just aren't that many tiles, leading to ships that feel really similar to each-other, even between two different factions. \n\n\tIt doesn't help that every faction shares the exact same functional parts, even if the overall shape and internal space is different. Offworld security ships could have holding cells, Foundry ships could have functioning and dangerous refinery/factory areas, and other stuff for the other factions. But nope, it's just airlocks, engines, empty space, terminals, weapons rooms, cargo rooms, alcoves and bridges for everyone.\n\n\tDon't let my list of criticisms stop you from buying the game. As long as you're creative you'll play it for at least 20 hours before getting the least bit board. It's only after that that you'll start to hope the game gets some improvements in the areas I've listed here.", "timestamp_created": 1507756939, "timestamp_updated": 1507757746, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.671745", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35645936": {"recommendationid": "35645936", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971763000", "num_games_owned": 524, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1233, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506752544}, "language": "english", "review": "Pure genius. It's like Hotline Miami and Gunpoint had a baby (which makes sense, this being the developer of Gunpoint.) The rogue-lite mechanics work briliantly, and while there are a few items and strategies that are noticably more effective than others, almost every tool and tactic at your disposal is viable on its own if you use it right. But it's when you combine them that Heat Signature really shines. When you start coming up with clever ways to combine gadgets in ways that make them exponentially more powerful, massive 7-key ships that would have taken you ten minutes to tackle (assuming you survived) become your playthings as you find and learn to combine more powerful weapons, teleporters, hacking tools, bullet-time powerups and shields (as well as collect versions of those gadgets that give you more uses per mission). Learning these combinations is absolutely essential for the tougher missions that require you to do things like go totally undetected in a ship swarming with guards, or steal something from a ship full of explosives where the guards all wear explosives that go off if you kill them.\n\nThe gameplay itself is like a thinking man's Hotline, where you can pause at any time and plan your attack or try to work your way out of the sticky situation that follows when your plan goes sideways. Sometimes you paint yourself into a corner you can't get out of though, and that's another thing Heat Signature really gets right. Instead of the frustration of YASD (Yet Another Stupid Death) that's so common in roguelites, taking a hit downs you but doesn't kill you. Instead, the guards throw you out of the airlock and depending on whether you're stunned or wounded you have a short or a shorter timer to remote control your pod and snatch yourself out of space. Each time you're wounded and retrieve yourself the timer gets shorter, making for increasingly tense rescues as your survival time dwindles while your character's gear level grows. You'll probably wind up with a few characters dying on you, but far more often you'll be incapacitated on the ship while the alarm goes off and they fly to the nearest station, capturing you. But if you're captured, you get to rescue yourself as another character and get another chance to retire as a living legend.\n\nAnother brilliant bit of the game is the \"defector\" missions, which are infinitely repeatable, puzzle-like challenges that unlock when you capture a new station. Some of them are relatively easy (take over a ship with an infinite use teleporter and an armor piercing knife) and some of them are mind-bendingly hard (teleporter and armor piercing knife, but the armored guards are rigged with the aforementioned explosives and no one else has an armor piercing gun for you to steal.) They're totally optional though, which makes the difficulty fun rather than a barrier to progression.\n\nI could write volumes about Heat Signature, but I've said enough for a Steam review. If the words \"roguelite action-strategy\" or \"defenestrate yourself into space\" sound at all appealing, you will have a good time with Heat Signature.

For the second, think of yourself as playing a movement, not playing a characher. I've had characters last 2 missions before getting captured. I've had characters that fail over and over but don't get captured (because i'm trying to play beyond my equipment, or got impatient). and after I complete a personal mission they get retired.

Take a look at the mission - just my luck - huge ship with lots of guards (around 50 or so) and everyone has a shield, making them immune to any weapons unless you disable the shield with crashers or subverters. I only have 1 rechargable crasher with 3 charges - definitely not enough to clear the ship of guards. \n\nWith progressive clearing of the ship from opposition out of question I resort to stealthy approach: using 2 high capacity rechargable stealth shields and 1 self charging slip stream which I just won from a mysery crate I carefully maneuver around the guards, pickpocketing keycards right in plain view of their teammates. Managed to walk all the way to the middle of the ship without alerting anyone and got next to the pilot. I'm thinking: hey if I knock this guy out there will be no alarm response and thus no risk of getting captured or ship getting away. The only weapon I have at this moment however is a very loud automatic stun gun. Failing to realize that I'm about to alert half of the ship guards I disable the pilot's shield and shoot him off his chair. \n\nGuards come converging at me from all directions having their shiny shields I can't disable and about to hand my ass over to me on a platter. Using stealth shield and splitstream I manage to sneak my way out of the charging guards only to realize that one of them, standing in the middle of the resulting clusterfk has the keycard I need to progress further. Coming back to him is suicide - other guards won't let me near him to pickpocket. \n\nThat was the end of a quiet approach. In order to progress further I would need guards from other side of the locked door to open it for me. And so I took out my trusty fully automatic stun gun and made some noise. Guards came charging through the locked door keeping it open just long enough for me to slipstream through under cover of my stealth shield, and using the pause to defly grab the so much needed keycard from the guard at the back of group. \n\nThat was the end of it - my target was just behind the door I had keycard for, so I grabbed it, and fired one last shot of the stun gun - trough the window.

And that's pretty much the main \"goal\" of the game. However, that's not what it's all about. It's really all about the stories you make during your gameplay. Using the active pause function, you can plan out every move you could want to make second by second (or go all Hotline Miami and never pause once) and systematically rip rooms apart as (in)efficiently as possible. For example, say you were spotted by several teleporting armored guards equipped with energy shields and OH NO! You don't have any AP weapons or ammo, and you JUST ran out of shield subverter charges! Not to worry, THROW A FUGGIN WRENCH THROUGH THE SHIP WINDOW AND SUCK THOSE MOFO'S INTO THE VACUUM OF SPACE!

You have stealth shields and your own emergecy energy shields, breach grenades and EVEN MORE slowmotion. Difficulty isn't the problem, for me at least. Even without the proper tools you can still push the kitted guards around, or knock them in to the void, or blow up the room they are in. It's not easy, but you can always overcome the obstacle. Here, have a list.\n\nTimelimit-Kill the pilot, or destroy the engines\nShields- disable them, knock them into space, sneak by using a gadget, or just steal the keycard without killing them\nArmor-Armor piercing weapons, and everything mentioned straight above\nGUARDS EVERYWHERE- Stealth shields or whatever they're called, energy shields, or being a pure badass and using all of your weapons at once, seriously, switching weapons takes no time and you can throw almost anything\n\nAs for just general fun shit, I REALLY like the concussion hammers, and slipstreams (Basically even more OP slowmo)\nThe hammers will either knock the enemy out, or knock them really far back. The slipstreams are really good for taking out an entire spaceship worth of guards all running at you, best paired with a super shotgun.\n\nI think the game's pretty fucking good. It drops down in fun level after the first 5 or so hours, but it's still really fun, and contrary to many of the negative reviews, it's not actually hard if you unlock some of Sovereign's Tools and gear before you decide to go and throw yourself at a \"Mistake\" level mission. (remember, stores are a thing in each station. The more you play, the more stuff available)\n\nOk, now I'll share some stories!\nI was performing a characters personal mission. I had to go through a giant sovereign ship filled with guards, to avenge a fallen loved one. ALL Enemies had energy shields, so I brought 3 crashbeams to take out shields. 2 had 3 uses, and the other only had two. I used them wisely, sneaking throught the ship, usually lining up guards and taking out two shields at a time. I made sure to only kill the guards that NEEDED to be killed, so I could maximise my distance with only 8 crashbeams, taking out the occasional group in a flurry of silenced shots and blade strikes. After a while, I realised I COULDN'T make it. I didn't have enough crashbeam uses left to get there. I pressed on though, with hope that I could make it, I HAD to try. I took out another group of people, but one shouted INTRUDER! and shot me. My time was now cut in half. I was out of crashbeam uses, and being carried towards the airlock unconcious. They threw me out, in to space. I had 12 seconds to catch myself with my pod, (Via remote control) or bleed out and suffocate in space. I cought myself with 6 seconds left, which meant next time I was thrown out the airlock I'd only have six. Back in my pod, I rushed towards the airlock, to try and reboard the ship just so I could take out it's engines and disable it to give me as much time as I needed. Before I re-docked however, I flew too close to the ships window. A guard saw my pod. They knew I was out there. The guard manning the missiles, also knew I was out there now. My pod got shot, but I repaired it. Of course, my pod was still damaged, and even running on limited emergency fuel, but flyable. I redocked, using as little fuel as possible. Then, I used my silenced shotgun to take out all of the fuel tanks, located in the back of the ship, right next to where I docked. The guards heard this so about 4 were sent to kill me. I did not have 4 crashbeam uses left. I had 0. But, by the time they got to me, one tank was still left, and I shot it as they walked into the room. the next 3 seconds lasted an eternity. the entire room was going to blow, and the only way out was threw the guards. That didn't matter though, because even if the room blew up with me in it, as long as I wasn't shot, I'd have about 30 seconds of oxygen to catch myself again with my pod. If I was shot though, I'd only have 6 seconds of blood before I passed out and died in the void. Ok, now just a tiny break from dramatic story telling: I was writing this part thinking I ended up dead, THEN, I remembered, that was from another story. So, in this one, it doesn't kill me. I was remembering ANOTHER, similar, but different missiong I played. So I DIDN'T get shot, and had thirty seconds of Oxygen to catch myself. Yes, I was caught in a fuel tank explosion and am somehow not bleeding, but SHHHHHHHHHHHH, don't tell tom francis it doesn't make sense, it saved me. So, I caught myself, once again using limited emergency fuel. The main ship no longer had any fuel too though, so I no longer had a time limit. It would just drift in space, as long as it took me to win or die. Because of my unlimited time, I went away and recharged my crashbeams at a friendly station. Whcih was still terrifying, since I had to get there on limited fuel. I made it though, repaired my pod, refueled back to unlimited fuel, (until shot again) and then flew back to the disabled ship that my target was drifting on. I walked back to where I was right before I got shot and thrown to space the first time, and continued my murder spree. I killed a few more people, but then got stuck in an unfavorable situation. A room of 4 guards, plus me, and another guard down the hall that also saw me. I took out the four close ones, took down the 4th ones shield, and then lunged at them with my longblade. In the split second between lunge and hitting the guard, he fired. He fired a shotgun. Right in to me. Ok, calm down. I only have 6 seconds before I bleed out in space this time, but I can do it.\n\nI could not do it.\n\nThat was it. The end. I should've hijacked another spaceship and used it's missile system to blow up the one my target was on, after I disabled it and got rid of my time limit.\n\nThe other story which I almost mixed up with this one at times, didn't have energy shields on most guards, only a 5th, My pod wasn't damaged in that one, I DID get shot when blowing up the engines, but still survibed it. I got back on, killed some more guards, and then used a visitor teleportor to bypass the last 10 guards, teleport in to the room with the object I was stealing, as opposed to the person I was supposed to kill on ths story I told first, stole it, and got the fuck outta there. It was a succes! but, like I said, the first one was not. It was an angering defeat.\n\nThat's all.

At the time of writing I\u2019ve put 13 hours into Heat Signature, which is a lot for me; the game has grabbed my attention like no other has for a long time. \n\nThe game is built around an entertaining core with its ship-heist mechanics; the sheer quantity of gadgets and weapons means that there are tons of unexpected ways to succeed, and fail. It just feels great in the hands.\n\nI also find myself drawn to the role-playing aspects, which is not something I expected. With no scripted narrative to follow, the game becomes about the individual stories of the procedurally-generated characters you take charge of, each with their own look, ship, starting gadgets, and personal missions (a bit like the ambitions in Sunless Sea). All this is wrapped up in a procedurally-generated galaxy unique to you, which your characters are collectively working to liberate, one space station at a time. You see, hijacking a ship and completing its mission (assassinate, rescue, steal, etc.) fills up the \u201cliberation\u201d gauge, which upon filling allows you to annex an adjacent station belonging to one of the galaxy\u2019s factions, into your independent empire. I presume \u201ccompletion\u201d of the galaxy comes once all these stations are independent, at which time the galaxy could be regenerated via the menu option; but completion really isn\u2019t the point here I don\u2019t think.\n\nIt\u2019s all about the stories that emerge from your antics role-playing the many characters - one wants to rescue their husband, another wants revenge on the person that killed their sister; all characters have some form of motivation like this. So the game for me is a roguelike RPG, with stories emerging from the delightful mix of mechanics and procedurally-generated scenarios - the ultimate achievement for videogame narrative in my eyes. It reminds me of Sunless Sea in many favourable ways, but with less authored content and more gameplay mechanics; and like that game, all your characters have an affinity with one another. \n\nThe game has an addictive \u201cone more go\u201d quality, meaning you always want to do just one more ship before you turn it off, because it is just so fun to play.\n\nThe ambient soundtrack is hypnotic, and I happily whiled away an afternoon playing this on my laptop with the speakers on while my wife read on the sofa, such is the pleasantness of the music and sound effects. Coupled with the beautifully simplistic and minimalist art, the game is a pleasure to interact with and spend time in.\n\nAs with Gunpoint, the developers\u2019 previous big game, the developer seems to have thought of everything - the interface, though busy, is clear and always has the information I need to hand. The game is robust and polished throughout, with great attention to detail, as in the artistic variations between stations and ships of different factions. It seems very well engineered, and was even solidly playable on a below-min-spec laptop.\n\nIn a nutshell for me, Heat Signature is an immersive sci-fi story generator, and its content seems infinite. \n\nAs a final note, I\u2019ve been following its main creator, Tom Francis, for some time on social media and his personal blog. I\u2019ve never met him, but Tom seems to be an incredibly nice, sound and honest guy, and a talented developer and writer to boot! He not only makes games but gives a lot back to the industry, such as with his GameMaker tutorial video series (and indeed if you\u2019re interested in making games, I recommend the Supporter\u2019s Edition, which contains early playable prototypes and documentary videos - not to mention the mesmerising soundtrack).

It needs an content update that expands the games core mechanics.\n\nGive me a wider selection of firearms, that do different things, the everything gun is amazing but why not give me a gun that shoots web that catches bullets as it flies through the air, or a thunder gun that emp's everything around it and can hit enemies through their shields, or mini black holes that destroy entire rooms, or just a flame thrower. different mission, instead of hijacking one ship, have an entire fleet flying together with my objectie on one of them, add more story to the mission, and give me a purpose to steal something or save someone, something that was in gunpoint thats not in Heat Signature is the clever script writing. Newer and cooler ways to indirectly dispose of my enemies and get to my goal. Why not let me hack the ship from the captian seat and jetisons certian groups of enemies that are near airlocks or something. Different alien races with new 'plasma' themed weapons that disintergrate bodies. Different pods for me to fly around, maybe a pod emp's the ship when it docks. All it needs is some more variety in the weapons, gadgets, enemies, and ships. \n\nThe game is great and is worth the price for what i got out of it. But it needs a bit more content to it to play it any longer.\n\nWill happily come back to the game if it gets updated in the future.\n", "timestamp_created": 1507466170, "timestamp_updated": 1507466170, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499679", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35571368": {"recommendationid": "35571368", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010925173", "num_games_owned": 408, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 721, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 7, "last_played": 1514060356}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a fun game and I think it is very well designed.

A little like VATS in fallout, without the miss chance. \n\nThere is a subtle layer of humour in the game, which are nice but don't detract from the overall experience. \n\nThe rogue-like elements of the game give a sense of over arching progression, but you also feel a harsh loss if a character dies in the vacuum of space, without fulfilling their destiny (and you lose their cool rare gadgets). Yet, there is a sense of closure, when your 30 mission veteran is bloodied and battle scarred to the point where you can retire them, and giving them legendary status. \n\nThe game swings between almost impossible, requiring split second (in game) precision, and no margin for error, proper planning and execution to quick smash and grabs, which in the late game give you an almost god-like sense of steamrolling an entire ship in 10 in game seconds. It depends on your mood which you choose to complete, whether it's to farm gear on a medium range ship, do some little ships for the money, or take on a large stacked ship for the challenge. There's a definite 'one more mission' addictive feel to this game. \n\nI don't believe the game is ever unfair in its difficulty, the mission briefs outline the risk, and the rewards are commensurate to that. One exception being armour piercing weaponry is a nightmare to find, and many personal missions require it. (let alone armour piercing non-lethal weaponry!) \n\nOn the downside, I wish there was a little more enemy variation, and I don't know if there will be any kind of updates, DLC or expansions, so I can't say this is a complete negative. The game has not long been out, but I'd enjoy more mission objective variety, clause variety, maybe a new faction, new gadgets and guard gear. This is not really a negative, it's the sign of a great game that it leaves you wanting more. \n\nController compatibility would be a huge plus, as I think it would lend itself to the strategic style in a couch gaming fashion, I find that mapping buttons with xpadder doesn't have the right feel to it, but maybe I just need to keep tweaking it. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1507445244, "timestamp_updated": 1507445244, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35563819": {"recommendationid": "35563819", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015513850", "num_games_owned": 12, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 121, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507447161}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is rad. Tom Francis is rad. Do you like sneaking around? You can do that. Do you like blasting into a room and smashing six guards unconscious with a wrench, and the last one flies out a window of the spaceship you're on, and you and that guard get sucked out into space, so you have to maneuver your own little ship to your drifting body to pick yourself up and re-dock with the big ship to get back to sneaking around and killing the hell out of guards and taking their stuff? You can do that, man. That's something you can do a lot of the time, actually. Plus, if you do it wrong and die, you've got a roster of plenty of other cool generated characters to choose from. If your character gets captured instead of dying, you might even get a chance to rescue your old character. If a Steam friend's character gets captured, you could even get the chance to rescue that character and rob them of the opportunity, like a true space pirate.\n\nThe galaxy is your oyster, so smash that thing open with a Concussion Hammer or use a gadget to ... well, the galaxy is already in space, but you could use a gadget to teleport it out into space if it were an enemy instead of the actual galaxy. Anyway, this game is very good. It has the \"just one more mission\" appeal that marks a quality quick-fire kind of game that you could pick up for just a mission, and take maybe a few minutes, or suddenly find your mouth dry, your stomach growling, your eyes red, your butt numb, and your family pleading for you to just stop playing the game already, man, it's a beautiful day outside, but you're like, \"Nuh-uh, man, I want to break into more spaceships.

You've basically seen everything at that point.\n\nThe AI is awful. The guards huddle up in 1 room, then if you wait a bit one of them will leave to go work in a different room. You kill that guy, wait, and then another guy will leave the huddle. Rinse and repeat.  Simply standing in a room next to the huddle and wait is ALL YOU HAVE TO DO, for almost EVERY mission. I have NEVER seen any instance where 2 guys go wander around at the same time. \n\nThe game itself is easy. As soon as you're spotted, time slows to a crawl. It gives you more time to plan your next attack, but it's a silly mechanic because you can pause the action at any time anyways.  There isn't an option to turn off time slowing down, so this makes the game laughably easy.  You have to kill the guard who sees you before he yells \"INTRUDER\" and alerts the ship, but when time is SLOW you can easily kill him before that happens. I wish him spotting you played out in real time - it would force me to use pause more and plan things out better.  \n\nThe \"hard\" missions are only hard because they add in shielded or armored guards. All you need to do is grind to find an armor piercing weapon or a weapon to disable the shields and boom, then that mission becomes as easy as all the others.\n\nI wish Steam had a \"mixed\" review, because this game is sooo close to being great... Fair price, fun concept, but seeing all the other Positive reviews with 10+ hours in the game seems misleading to me.

Not without its flaws, but they hardly manage to compromise the fun you'll be having.\n\nVisuals are good, controls are simple but solid and you'll rarely find yourself doing the wrong thing despite some degree of contextual controls(which is hard to accomplish! Props to the Heat Sig dev), and the music/sound design is simple but ideal(not cluttered with too many SFX, just a solid backing track and sound effects only when you need to know something's going on).\n\nThe good is that the game has a LOT of variety to toss at you, and a lot of fun challenges. \n\nThe only bad is that it takes a bit to start unlocking some of the variety, and it feels like adding a bit more variety to ship interiors and AI behavior would've helped make the game more interesting and a bit less predictable. Sometimes it's just a bit too easy to take advantage of the same AI behavior multiple times in a row, and until the variables start piling up, or unless you willingly challenge yourself, some of the missions are just a bit too formulaic.\n\nWhere the game really shines, honestly, is in the Defector missions, where you're given some of the game's more fun tools... but a selective variety of them, forcing you to employ some tools you normally never would(like Swappers, I mean, seriously, in most missions they barely have a point), more stealth and less violence.\n\nThe main game is mostly a stealth sim ala Dishonored or Thief, while the Defector missions are closer to puzzle missions, and they're REALLY strong.\n\nIf there's something the game lacks, it's a toolkit to develop your own pre-set defector missions and hostile ship layouts, and then to share these with others. Because there's a REALLY strong backbone for making cool missions(especially if you could alter NPC behavior while doing so), but the randomized nature of 90% of the game sabotages the potential a bit.\n\nSo, tl;dr it's a 4 out of 5 game, and I really hope the devs plan to patch in that last 1, because it feels like it's just so very close within reach.

There is an awesome game packed behind many things that annoyed me.\n\nFor reference, I'm really not a fan of roguelike games which some of my frustration just comes from that design. But that's not interesting here. I do think that even if you don't really like roguelike games, there is fun to be had here.\n\nThe first major annoyance is the game is pretty bad at teaching you things or actually explaining the rules. A few frustrations:\n - The game doesn't actually tell you all of the buttons for everything. I found out about using 't' to throw a weapon and 'shift' on the pause screen to pan the camera from internet comments.\n - Timers. The mission timers starting from when you accept the mission and not when you arrive is frustrating (since travel can take 20s) and doesn't particularly make sense. So just skip the missions\n - Alarms can be stopped up to the instant they expire by killing the pilot. But leaving the ship (by your choice or getting thrown out) does not reset them. But you can re-enter the ship without any notification or visual difference that you might instantly lose your character\n - You can use melee weapons to dash at enemies, but you cannot dash away. This sometimes leads to times when you pause and see a bullet coming but cannot do anything about it.\n\nBut these area all small in the end. The fun of teleporting around, swapping with others, and just putting your tools to the test is super fun. The game feels a lot like Metal Gear Solid 5 when taking over a base. There's a lot of approaches and none has to be best, but succeeding even when things start to go wrong feels great.\n\nFor me, the best part is actually the practice area (which clicking \"restart mission actually generates a new one... which is annoying for practicing against a specific mechanic...). Here, you don't have to bother with the boring and pointless travel between areas. Failure doesn't matter, just try again. Experimentation and fun is encouraged everywhere. And there's still tons of stuff to play with.\n\nSo there's fun here, but for people like me, the end of the game isn't the goal. Just playing in the practice area is super fun. I just kinda wish the rest of the game was a bit more streamlined and there were fewer annoyances to make that feel worth while to me.", "timestamp_created": 1507389285, "timestamp_updated": 1507389285, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35532027": {"recommendationid": "35532027", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071267763", "num_games_owned": 78, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 670, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508118529}, "language": "english", "review": "One of my characters killed over 200 people and layed waste to an entire faction alone.

It looked to me like a blend of Monaco and an easy-to-learn-hard-to-master puzzle game, which are both my jam.\n\nBut I didn't last a full hour before ragequitting for good, so, in the interest of helping anyone else with my druthers, here's why.  \n\nI like figuring out how things work, trying different ways to tackle a mission or solve a puzzle, understanding how things work, learning how the logic of the game world works, and trying again.  It looked like this game would work that way, but:\n\n1) Getting TO each mission was a giant pain in the keister.  The missions themselves let you pause, let you control the behavior of your character precisely and elegantly with a few clicks, and the game carries out difficult tasks like a headshot or an 8-meter dash-and-bash all by itself -- but to GET to that part of the game, you have to control a ship careening through space at a billion miles an hour, on your own, with zero automation, with nothing but aiming your mouse, left button thrusts, right button brakes.  It is the opposite of the careful planning and meticulous execution that's waiting for you -- it's like playing bumper cars with a blindfold on.  I routinely spent longer trying to REACH my target than carry out my mission, and I hated every second of it.  It felt like a completely different game with the opposite design philosophy of the game I'd watched all this footage of.  If there were a mode that let me skip this part of the game, I probably wouldn't have returned it for a refund.\n\n2) It is really, really hard to tell which of the tiny indistinct humans on the screen is your character.  The camera doesn't auto-center on you -- which is good, because camera control is good in games that need stealth -- but especially when you're still figuring out how to play, it means you spend way, way too much time trying to figure out which of the dudes in the little room is you ... and by the time you have, they've hurled you out into space.  Sure, you can pause at any second, but the little men are SO hard to tell apart that that doesn't help as much as you'd think.\n\n3) You get hurled out into space.  That ... is ... well, I've played puzzle games and I've played roguelikes, and I've enjoyed both, but here's the thing.  It takes me more than literally one use of a mechanic to figure out how to physically, mechanically do it, and then I have to realize I need to.  The tutorial hurls you out into space once, so, okay, sure, the game has technically shown you how to do it.  But suddenly my character is running out of oxygen, and I need to figure out how to do something about it.  And then it turns out what I have to do about it is .... steer my pod again.  My pod.  That I just finished complaining that it was so hard to steer.  So basically your punishment for not even having started to master the precisely controlled, meticulously planned part of the game yet, is that you have to do more of the hard-to-control, chaotic, high-speed, can't-pause-to-control-this part of the game.  At this point I would just give up and let my character die because controlling my pod is very difficult.  I am not physically well-coordinated, and what drew me to this game watching LPs of it was how you could very very precisely control what happened without needing to have great reflexes.  Very frustrating.\n\n4) THERE IS NO QUICKSAVE.  Cat just came in with a rat in his mouth?  Computer crashing?  Toddler screaming in the next room?  House on fire?  Any of the other million reasons you might need to quit this game right this very second?  Tough.  If you try to quit the game during a mission, instead of letting you restart where you left off, the game tells you helpfully, \"Hey, if you quit right now, this character will die!  That okay?\"  No, game, it is not.  Even when I'm playing a roguelike, and I expect I might lose all my progress at any time, a game will generally let me save and resume later in case, say, the stock pot is boiling over and I need to turn off this software for a while.  This is very basic modern game design, guys.  If I'm spending $$ on something, I need to be able to turn it off when Real Life happens and come back later without the game punishing me for it with a character death.", "timestamp_created": 1507340255, "timestamp_updated": 1507340255, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497512", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35530964": {"recommendationid": "35530964", "author": {"steamid": "76561197963998753", "num_games_owned": 842, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2239, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511725983}, "language": "english", "review": "More fun than my momma's Braciola on Sunday dinner!", "timestamp_created": 1507338625, "timestamp_updated": 1507338625, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35529777": {"recommendationid": "35529777", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040483408", "num_games_owned": 96, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 66, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506208454}, "language": "english", "review": "Think Hotline Miami turned into an RPG and slowed the fuck down.\nAnd i mean, completely remove any fast-paced gameplay by default.\nIt didn't turn out to be something i liked but if it strikes your fancy, it's something you should try.", "timestamp_created": 1507332554, "timestamp_updated": 1507332554, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502054", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35528925": {"recommendationid": "35528925", "author": {"steamid": "76561197965158099", "num_games_owned": 816, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 521, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506785917}, "language": "english", "review": "+Multiple characters to choose from at any time with randomized loadouts.\n+Many choices on how to handle each mission with varying gadgets and weapons.\n+You can punch people out of a spaceship window and then pick them up before they suffocate.\n=Defector missions are fun and force you to use potentially unusual loadouts. but have no impact on the game,\n-Visuals are a bit too minimalist, rooms look extremely similar and it's hard to determine what is cover or not without using the collision detection ability.\n-Dishonored syndrome - You become far too powerful too quickly.

My capture target was surrounded by guards, all protected by shields. I had one charge left on my shield deactivator. I managed to make my target vulnerable, then knocked him out with my concussive gun. The other guards charged me but I retreated into my pod and detached. I then docked somewhere else, fired a gun to draw attention, and then as all the guards ran over to me I got back in my pod and flew back to the first area. My target was now abandoned, and I picked him up and flew away.\n\nHeat Signature is all about boarding and raiding ships, with various goals ranging from \"kill this guy\" or \"steal this item\" to more complex things like \"hijack the ship by neutralizing everyone on board\" or special missions like \"rescue a hostage without being seen.\" There are a lot of things to help you on the way, from standard weapons to things like crashbeams (which short out all electronics they hit) several different kinds of teleporter, and much more.\n\nThere are many ways to approach any situation. Say you need an item behind a locked door protected by three guards. You could a) use a shotgun to take them all out at once, b) use a stealth shield to get past them and pickpocket the keycard, c) play the role of the horror movie monster and pick off the guards one by one as they leave to do other things, d) teleport into the room, or e) destroy the room with a breach grenade, then dock your pod to the convenient hole in the ship.\n\nHeat Signature revolves around an at-will \"bullet time\" effect. At any time, you can press spacebar to pause the game. This allows you to do things like view your inventory, teleport dropped items on the ship to you, swap equipped items, and time your attacks more effectively. The game also slows down when a guard spots you or when you aim a weapon. This setup allows you to do crazy things like clear a whole room without needing lightning reflexes or a time-slowing powerup. Even if you stumble into a guard\u2019s line of sight, you have a few seconds before he identifies you and then a few more seconds before he raises the alarm, triggering a capture timer as the ship you\u2019re on flees. This countdown can be stopped by killing the pilot, or otherwise removing them from their seat. And if you don't like any of your missions you can go out and raid some ships just because!\n\nThe characters you can choose from have different personal missions, and have different starting gear. Each time you retire or get a character killed or captured, you choose a new character with a fresh inventory. Items do NOT carry over. Think of each character as a different save file in the same world. However, you can find \"heirloom\" items --special items you name when you retire a character after completing their personal mission-- in ship crates or shops. You can even find your friends heirloom items! You can also rescue captured characters and rescue your friends\u2019 characters. Combine that with randomized galaxies to get a true never-ending experience.\n\nThis game also loves to be funny. With item tooltips like \"What if grenades, but faster?\" (rapid grenade launcher), to \"Few guards, not skeleton guards\" (skeleton crew), to \"this weapon causes people to die. usually forever\" (lethal weapon) and other things that will make you laugh..\n\nThis game is surprisingly solid. The only bug I have found is when you try to \"jump\" from one opening to another, your character spazzes out and gets placed in the airlock.\n\nA typical mission starts in the station, where you have 4 or 5 missions to choose from. You can see each missions\u2019 main objective, pay, and any special conditions the mission might have. By selecting a mission, you can see the guards\u2019 loadouts and get general info about the ship, such as alarm response time, guard quantity, and any special things the ship or guards might have. After choosing a mission, you go to your boarding pod and leave the station. You have an objective marker showing which direction the target ship is. After flying out to the ship, you then must maneuver to the airlock, avoiding the ships spotlights. Once docked, the camera zooms in and you can see the entire interior of the ship. Then you must make your way to the objective. This typically consists of killing guards and taking their keycards, then going to the next group and repeating the process, however you can also pickpocket the keycard or just use a subverter on the door. Afterwards you make your way back to the pod and head back to a station. You can also smash a window for a quicker exit, or hijack the ship and fly back in style.\n\nIn conclusion, Heat Signature is a good play and a great game for completionists. It is complex enough to be fun while simple enough to still be understandable.

Hotline Miami-esque gameplay with a more indepth field of strategy thanks to how pausing works and how every decision you make has to be final. The game has you controlling one character at a time during missions, however over the course of the game you will be responsible for many characters rather than one, each of whom will obtain their own gear and currency, which is where the grind starts to kick in, and where problems arise with the loot and sense of progression.\n\nLuckily enough once you get into the flow of the game this can be quickly overcome due to how quick and easy it is to start up a new character. But my main issue lies with the unfulfilling nature of each character's progression. Obtaining rare and really useful loot is a bittersweet affair, as that character will soon be retired, and then you start a fresh new character. You can't stash items in a pool for all characters to use, you can simply leave behind ONE item that then becomes available as a rare find throughout your playthrough. This is where the game kicks you in the balls regarding any sense of achievement and just makes each new character seem like a slog.\n\nThe actual gameplay is very fun and variable, with many ingenius ways to approach succeeding in a mission. There are, however, a few issues with balance. Enemy AI for the most part is pretty stupid. The game may throw some really difficult situations at you, but the penalty for failure is relatively low. Even if you get shot on the ship, you are merely thrown out, just to be rescued via your pod with very little difficulty, until you have reached the blood loss limit where after a half dozen or so times of being shot, you straight up die, which never happened to me during an entire playthrough.\n\nSome items, especially melee ones, are massively overpowered given the dual wielding aspect. Guns for the most part are an underpowered last resort, that are only ever useful if you wish to waive Pacifist bonuses, and don't care about raising alarms. Not to mention ammo cannot be bought, making Armour Piercing guns kinda pointless up against the more readily available restockable nade launchers and Melee alternatives. After a while, it becomes pretty obvious which loadouts are superior, and which items you should unlock for your shop. There's no real reason to not bring alone a Key Cloner, a Sidewinder and Subverters. The game may have made more sense if they had created character skill trees limiting what you could use, making the game infinitely more interesting. As it stands, you have an entire arsenal of gear come the mid game just ready to be bought, making all missions far too easy.\n\nAll said, if you like the sound of the action in Heat Signature and aren't put off by the mistakes made with the rpg-lite progression of the campaign, there is a good 15 hours to be had here.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1507296435, "timestamp_updated": 1507296435, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497512", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35516272": {"recommendationid": "35516272", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000815042", "num_games_owned": 253, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 5457, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 219, "last_played": 1513445483}, "language": "english", "review": "Liked GUNPOINT, like this... more?

You throw your wrench against the wall so the guy behind a locked door opens it. Then you pause. Switch to your sidewinder teleporter to get through the now open door. Pause. Teleport your wrench back to you. Shoot your silenced concussive gun at the one guard down the hall then run up and slice up your target before they even know what happened. Then shoot the window and jump into space.\n\nMoments like that are the core to Heat Signature. They\u2019re tense and exhilarating. And, unfortunately, not super common. Most missions either you breeze through or fail. Failure in this game can be pretty brutal. Often one mistake means you\u2019ll have to abort the mission or can no longer play as that character. When you\u2019re just starting out and don\u2019t have access or know-how of certain equipment, this feels frustrating or too luck based. \u201cWait. Why\u2019d that happen?\u201d and \u201cOh\u2026 I don\u2019t actually have anything that can deal with this right now.\u201d Were phrases I muttered frequently until I better understood the game.\n\nThis is a game that some folks will undoubtedly love. It\u2019s has solid computable mechanics that utilize AI randomness well, fantastic but unintrusive writing, interesting emergent storytelling, and an endless amount of procedural content. However, I found the learning curve to be too steep and the game didn\u2019t really click with me until about 6+ hours with it. I wasn\u2019t really expecting or have time for another 20+ experience to actually complete it.\n\nMy chief criticism with Heat Signature is its structure. There are persistent upgrades that you unlock, but with each character you\u2019re constantly cycling through overly easy missions only to get to more difficult missions and probably die, or mess up and need to abort. You\u2019re constantly getting set back to much less interesting content.\n\nHowever when you can pull of those harder missions, it\u2019s amazing. Some of the best gaming moments of 2017. The highs are SO high that I wish I was more excited for the game as a whole. If only it were a compacted 5 to 10 hour game with more of a focus on the emergent story mechanics. As of now, it just feels a bit too grindy and long.\n\nThe game does have missions called \u201cdefector missions\u201d where you play a one-off character with specific gear. They are probably the best parts and are a great way to learn how the game wants you to play it. Example: I had one that started me outside of the target\u2019s ship with no pod and too guns with limited ammo. I had to shoot backwards to push myself to the ship, get on board, slaughter everyone, and steal the ship. It was rad. But the best thing about those missions is that you can restart them at any time. Failure in them is not much of a set back, other than the ship\u2019s layout being completely different.\n\nAs of writing this review I put about 9 hours into this game and liberated one of the four enemy strongholds. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be putting too much more time into this game. I like it, and it will likely have a fanatic community around it, but it\u2019s just not quite what I was looking for.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a good game to play with a podcast on, action-puzzle-like game, or something that you chip away at over months, then Heat Signature is a pretty solid choice. If you\u2019re looking for something more focused, then maybe look somewhere else. \n", "timestamp_created": 1507193949, "timestamp_updated": 1507193949, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35487546": {"recommendationid": "35487546", "author": {"steamid": "76561197968359421", "num_games_owned": 584, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 1477, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508552155}, "language": "english", "review": "What a good [i]good [b]good[/b][/i] game.

Having only dabbled in a few easy missions, I took my dagger assassin into a stray ship, that was seen on the way to my mission point. I entered this off to the side ship, and immediately saw several guards with guns. I was in a very wide open area, and saw some loot crates that I thought I could dash to.\n\nVaulting across the room, one guard saw me and sounded the alarm. No problem, I thought. I sneakily killed one guard who had a key, and jumped into the loot crate room to snag some goods. Now I just have to get off the ship.\n\nExcept about 8 guards were now surrounding the loot crate room, all armed with guns. No problem. I'll just switch places with one of them at the last possible second, and make a dash for my escape pod. I waiting for the first of the guards to open the door, and stepped to the side as he unloaded a shot gun blast. Whew. About 10 steps behind him, was a buddy guard. I used a time slow down gadget to run past the first guard, used the switch places gadget to instantly teleport that few extra spaces with the late guard, and made it to about the midway of the massive entry floor before the remainder of the guards surged into line of site and all opened fire. \n\nMy screen was covered in spread shot, from one side of the massve cabin to the other. Even with the slow down time in place, there simply wasn't enough room to outmanuever the shots. One caught me. Okay, just avoid the rest. About 6 feet away from my escape pod, I failed to realize my time slow down was about to expire, and the shotgun projectiles suddenly resumed their full speed, and several of them slammed into me at once. Ouch.\n\nLesson learned. Do not attempt to explore random ships with only a dagger thinking you're Assassin's Creed skills will somehow subdue the superior defenses onboard.\n\nMoving on, I quickly selected a new character and went back to dagger and longswording my way through several assassination type missions. Fun times. \n\nPros of this Game\n-Characters experience perma death, but can be retired to preserce their life time stats and achievements\n-Killing is fun, and is performed in a multitude of ways, ranging from weapon types to envirenmental assistance\n-Mission types are bite sized, meaning you do not have to dedicate large amounts of time to have some fun\n-Stats, I personally love stats, especially kill stats. Shallow think to like but too many games forgo this\n-AI is well fleshed out. I feel like I can outsmart and outmanuever any of them, but never feel safe enough as to think I can't be caught in return if I mess up\n\nCons of this Game\n-I can see where people may not like the finite mission generation system. A lot of it is cookie cutter and with a small pool of random factors. This can easily be fixed via future updates or mod support.\n-With the limited amount of overall loot and special items, it can be very easy to feel like you've seen it all after liberating a few of the stations over the first few hours of gameplay. This is not a negative, but will apply heavily to people who get bored quickly outside the game's base mechanics\n\nSome Suggestions\n-Adding some form of player rivalry\n I'd like to be able to take on a contract to beat another player to a mission of some sort that spawns in real time. First come, first serve. Or daily kill, knockout, loot, or mission complete charts that players attempt to stay at the top of to gain additional achievement listings for their characters prestige. \n-Definatly more weapons and loot. This is something that takes work, and can not be expected to be released asap, but at the moment even I can feel the innate lack of discoverable items. Not bad for me, but many others will feel distaste.\n-Add missions where living witnesses eventually come back and attack your station, or try to intercept you enroute to your next mission. Would let players intentionally draw more prey, or be punished by thinking that person they let live was a good idea.\n-More stats! You know we can take the knocked out bodies of our enemies onto our pod or with us when we fly their ship back to our station? That isn't reflected anywhere. My stats need to reflect I was merciful to a few, and imprisoned some as well, instead of just letting them slip back into space to continue their pirate ways.\n-Multi Part mission would be cool. Let me string together a succession of selecteable missions back to back before returning to station for reward. Better stats or reward for doing so, either or would be awesome.\n\nA great game overall! For people like me it is perfect, as I adore farming for kill stats, and always enjoy the randomly generated mission objectives, with an overall objective to reach in game.\n\nI love it.\n\n10/10 would shoot the glass out of the window and mistakenly be too close to it and be sucked out again", "timestamp_created": 1507161535, "timestamp_updated": 1507161535, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35482361": {"recommendationid": "35482361", "author": {"steamid": "76561198155258764", "num_games_owned": 116, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 66, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506903667}, "language": "english", "review": "tbh it reminds me of a coolmath game", "timestamp_created": 1507159250, "timestamp_updated": 1507159250, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.366249", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35482249": {"recommendationid": "35482249", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999220823", "num_games_owned": 154, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 481, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507757709}, "language": "english", "review": "Basically procedural/rogue-like Miami Hotline in space - takes up to 10 minutes at most to do a single mission which is very relaxing.

Don't get me wrong, this game is good, and really fun, but 95% positive is stretching it. When I buy a game like that, I expect an amazing experience, but there's so many small changes that could be made here, to make huge improvements. I feel like it could have used longer in development before being fully released.\n\nFirstly, the big assertion with this game is 'you get yourself into terrible situations, then figure out how to get yourself out of them'. But if you're like me, and play cautiously, that's not really how the game works. There's never a need to go out of your way to do anything you're not equipped for, you can progress through the game just fine by taking small risks for less credits.\n\nI don't really think you would have to think hard to find your way out of situations to begin with. It takes little more than a glance to see the details of a mission and if you're properly equipped for it or not. Guards patrol by themselves, down hallways and out of the sight of other guards. Even if you run into a room with two guards, two melee weapons makes you practically unstoppable against them. The quicker they strike, the more guards you can approach with ease. Even alert and time-limits, clearly added to give the game more difficulty, are completely negated for the rest of the mission by taking out the pilot of the ship\n\nThen, even when you do get caught and attacked, they just throw you out of their ship instead of killing you outright. You pick yourself back up, and either resume the mission or abandon it, with no real penalty. The core difficulty for this game just doesn't really exist in the way the developers assert, nor how a lot of players would like you to believe. It's more reliant on you not caring about your choices until they get you into trouble, and playing careless, or even getting yourself into bad situations on purpose.\n\nFor those reasons alone I would not recommend this to people who 'try-hard' at the games they play. It's just a massive decrease in enjoyment for people like that.\n\nAnd, realistically, there's not even a huge penalty for taking the easier missions, because there's no way of knowing what missions will hold the weapons and equipment that are actually worth picking up. The weapon and equipment system is completely RNG, but not really that varied. There's a couple of melee weapons, a few guns, and several gadgets, and most of the 'rogue-like' qualities for them is how quickly they fire, the range, and how loud they are. The good ones completely over-shadow the ones that are 'meh', and it leads to just doing several missions until you find weapons you can actually use on the tougher missions.\n\nAnd the problem of variety doesn't just stop at equipment, characters themselves basically all play exactly the same. The tiny variations in starting equipment rarely makes a difference in the long run, which means each run is more-so dictated by what you manage to pick up while you play as the characters you've selected. Only the final mission offers any real static difference between them, and of course, you can't see what the mission will require of you until after you've been playing as them and gotten enough credits to get intel on that mission.\n\nSo let's talk about the changes I feel should be made to make this game deserving of that 95% rating.\n\nFirst of all, increased equipment variety would make a huge change. Once there's a greater variation in equipment, they can stop handing out items that don't even feel like they were worth picking up in the first place. The goal should be, almost every find means you have a new way of approaching your situations, rather than 'I'll use this until I get a better one'.\n\nSecondly, I do believe they should leave the universe as-is for a 'normal' mode. It's clear that people do have fun here, and a lot of casual players aren't going to be interested in the variety and difficulty that would be offered in my recommendations for a 'hard' and 'very hard' universe.\n\nA hard universe needs to, first and foremost, stop pulling punches with the guards on a ship. There should be fewer single-patrol guards, and it would be ideal to replace them with multi-patrol guards. Each ship should have a number of back-up pilots that are detailed in the mission select screen, and each back-up pilot should go to the primary flight controls to take the helm once it's discovered that the pilot is missing. Perhaps adding some 'blood-hungry' guards that kill you on sight outright would also be a good idea, and this would also be listed in the mission briefing.\n\nNext, the characters should be offer more variations in gameplay. Have characters that walk slower or faster, refuse to use melee weapons or guns or certain equipment, or get 'nautious' after they kill or die faster in the vaccume of space. Give all of them one or two negative traits, and perhaps ocassionally a positive one, so that every character feels unique, and must be played in a unique way. \n\nHard mode should also not mention details on enemy equipment, other than including if you need armor piercing weapons in the basic mission details. Increased enemy variations for all modes would also be great, and add a lot more flavor to the aspect of this change. After a number of failed missions a character would be forced to retire, meaning that doing well would actually be a requirement to progress, and you could no longer fall back on just abandoning your goal if you think it's too hard.\n\nVery hard mode would offer MORE negative traits for characters, and NO mission details, other than the primary and side objectives for that mission. Credits offered would give you a general idea of the difficulty, but even the overall time limit would have to be discovered upon arriving at the ship. This would make every mission more tense, and really give a sense of accomplishment once you've done enough with your character to feel comfortable retiring them. Additionally, the back-up pilots would go to any available flight-control once there is an alert of an intruder on the ship.\n\nI know that just having a thumbs down is doing to net me a lot of 'not helpful' replies, but honestly, I write this review because I want to see this game be better. I love the foundation, I just think there's so many improvements that could be made to move it from 'good' to 'great', or even higher. \n\nIf you find yourself interested in spite of what this review mentions, I would say buy it when it's on sale.

Without several key features, Heat Signature could very well be quite similar to the aforementioned arcade shooter/beat-em-up/whatever. However, the game possesses several mechanics which drastically alter the feel of the game, when compared to Hotline Miami.\nThe first key feature is the permanence to actions taken in game. The game is perma-death, however progress is mostly saved, with the exception of losing the items you had on that character. This means that in every mission the option to bail is one which should be kept open at all times, because if you don't, you're likely to get captured and have to re-capture your guy again. This roguelike element means that every mission should be planned, extremely well. Which should be impossible if you know Hotline Miami, where the strange resurrection your character goes through is very much part of the game's tone and gameplay.\nAllowing finishing missions to be possible in the first place with perma-death on (noting that when you get shot, you don't die straight away. Instead, the guard tosses you out an airlock, where you have to figure out how to not die of oxygen deprivation) is allowed by the ability to pause the game and plan out your moves. The trailer doesn't lie people. Watching that will give you a good idea of how the game plays. This makes this game extremely strategic, especially in some of the timed missions where you have a limited amount of real-time to either disable the pilot or get out.\nThe third is the items. What can I say? When the enemies are too tough, your guns are too shit, and you are too lazy, you can enter a level with a plethora of shit and not-shit gadgets in the hope some of them will be useful. Instead of killing a man for the key, you might instead steal it right of his pants by slowing time and teleporting away. Or perhaps sprint to one of the terminals which allow you to manually unlock all doors of a certain security level. Much more likely is you'll use your key stealing gadgets, before realising it runs out of uses before you reach your goal, and have to teleport through a wall or use a reflector shield to get a man to kill themselves.\nAnyway, alls said and done, Hotline Miami and Heat Signature is a pretty retarded comparison. Heat Signature lets you rocket into a ships window using only your shotgun and sheer willpower to get you there. Hotline Miami is completely different. Honestly a feel like a bit of an idiot now. But, Heat Signature is full of planning, fuck-ups, un-fuck-ups, getting shot, having only 5 seconds to kill a man, hijacking another space trawler and using its missiles to assassinate a space-trawler, and wrenches.

The guards had shields and armour, rendering them impervious to attacks but this didn't matter, the mission had a ghost clause. Assasinate one man, and get out with out harming anyone alse or being spotted. \nI board the ship equipped with a high capacity slipstream, a concussive shotgun, and a shitton of various teleporters. Oh and of course, a keycard cloner.\nThe ship was huge, at least 100 rooms in it. I ran through it at an absurd speed, right into my first problem: the pilot. remember, I can't kill him, knock him out. I do the only thing I can to stop the time limit, and swap places with him, one moment he was quietly flying a ship, next he was in the hallway with a severe case of confusion. pilot taken care of, I now had to formulate a plan for... removing my target.\nI move to the room just adjacent to him. when I encounter my next dilemma. he has armour. so nothing I do will hurt him. Naturally my first response is to swap places with him, into a room full of his friends (great idea right?) I pause and activate my slipstream. which makes time flow 10x slower, and me 5x faster.\nI run out of the room so fast that the gaurds there don't even have the time to say \"INTRU\". They run after me but I've already vanished like the fucking ninja I am.\nNow the coast is clear and my target is alone but I still have to, you know, Kill him.\nI spot a window a few rooms away, and phase three begins. Pulling out, you guessed it, my swapper, I simultaneously speed up time and move this guy into the window room with several swaps. Finally as he is vomiting on the floor of the window room, Without a word I blow out the window with my concussive shotgun.\nAs the room depressurises my target and I are sucked in to the cold vacuum of space. I remotely pilot my pod to come pick me up as I have many times before. I watch from my own pods window as he asphyxiates, clutching at his pale neck. Finally his struggling stops and all is peaceful again. \nBuy this game.", "timestamp_created": 1507002672, "timestamp_updated": 1507002762, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35434645": {"recommendationid": "35434645", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049833677", "num_games_owned": 350, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 451, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509256125}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantastic game, not much outside of that to say, gameplay is fun and graphics are good.", "timestamp_created": 1507002414, "timestamp_updated": 1507002414, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35433647": {"recommendationid": "35433647", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073331097", "num_games_owned": 162, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 852, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512182768}, "language": "english", "review": "I punched the person I was supposed to capture out a window.

Throughout the game you complete missions, which in turn give you the ability to expand your rebellion, and take over new Bars which unlock more characters to join the shuffle of character choices, and unique story quests with set mission where if you complete it you get more items within the marketplace back at your Bars. \n\nThe action of the game itself involves accepting a range of different missions from Stealth extraction of a certain individual on the ship without being detected to making sure their are no witnesses while you murder everyone you come across on the randomly generated ships. After the acceptance of a mission you will be piloting your little one man ship, and zooming across space to find your target.

You get a mission, you complete that mission, then you get another. That's most of the game, no deep story, I find myself leaving out of boredom, but keep coming back because the missions are actually fun.\n\nThe other, is all the characters are very shallow, which could be considered \"not immersive\" but there is 0 customization outside of the weapons you buy. No stats, no special ships (When you capture a ship you basically just return it and get a shockingly low turn-in value for it 1/10th the value of a nice gun). Basically the only unique thing about each character is the 2 starter weapons, a 1 sentence explanation of why they are fighting which becomes your main objective, and their looks which cannot be altered.\n\nThe game is fun, and I do recommend if those arent a big issue for you. It's just sad to play this, and feel the entire time this could have been --Epic Greatness-- with a tiny bit more effort in development with immersion.

That was just the first room. Oh, and I only had 45 more seconds to get to the pilot or complete my objective. Solution? Teleported into the room with the item I needed to steal, then teleported back to my pod.\n\nNot every mission ends so well though. I've been sucked into space, suffocated, blown up, stunned, shot, and captured. Fortunately, that's not game over, because characters are replaced and some can be rescued. You can retire the characters that are truly heroic as well, and pass on some really good gear for future characters. There are other incentives to retire like not gaining as much progress because your character is literally so awesome it stops inspiring people.\n\nOverall, I recommend this game. The dark humor, clever gadgets, and ability to solve problems (that you probably created) can make every mission feel unique. I've taken to having each character specialize in a certain playstyle, so at any time I have 4 different gear sets to accomodate the mission accordingly.\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n[list]\n    [*]Freeform gameplay lets your approach every mission as you see fit.\n    [*]Surprising amount of depth.\n    [*]Clever gadgets used in weird combinations can result in some often hilarious kills.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n[list]\n    [*]Some mission parameters can be tough to complete if you don't have the right gadgets.

It's essentially a spaceship infiltration game. You take an agent on randomly generated missions to accomplish objectives on spaceships roaming around in space. The main objectives themselves are limited - Capture, Assassinate, Steal, Rescue, or Hijack. The distinction lies in the extra conditions added to the mission, such as no alarms, or no living witnesses, and in the various conditions of the mission that make it more difficult, such as turrets, extra guards, guards with special equipment, or a time limit. Each mission plays out like a puzzle. You have to look at the mission description to decide what equipment to take, and then figure out how to best use it to complete your objective. Failures happen often, but those failures just make the mission more interesting, as you try to salvage the mess that you made. Even if you completely hose it up and get captured, you just start over with a new character, and may even have the chance to rescue your imprisoned character later on.\n\nThere's no experience or levelling in the game. Character progression is made by obtaining new equipment, either by finding it on missions, or buying it in the store with money earned from those missions. Like with missions, there are a limited number of types of equipment, but modifiers to those equipment make a huge difference. For example, there are only a few basic gun types (gun, shotgun, rifle), but those guns can have modifiers like concussive, armor piercing, silent, and quick-firing. Gadgets are similarly modified. Each character has a high-difficulty personal mission to accomplish, so the character will spend a good bit of time amassing the gear needed to tackle that mission. But if they succeed, you can retire them and choose one of their items to make available for other characters to find later on. \n\nAs you accomplish missions, you will win enemy stations over to your side. This unlocks items for the shop, and also adds special defection missions, which are kind of like scenarios. In these you are given a particular agent with a certain set of items to accomplish a mission. These are great because they really teach you what you can do with a few pieces of high-level equipment. \n\nConcerning the combat, it's pausable real-time. Also, it automatically slows time when someone begins to notice you, or when bullets start flying. That suits this game well. It's not a game about twitch reflexes. It's about overcoming challenges through thought and planning, and making the best of bad situations. \n\nI highly recommend the game. I'm almost 20 hours in right now, and I still can't get enough of it. It's almost like a puzzle-game dressed up as an action game, in a rogue-like setting.

The last time I had done this things went smoothly enough and I ended up stealing the besieged ship and returning it home with barely a scratch on the paintwork. This time however my plans were to be foiled by the horribly beweaponed battlecruiser that would show up approximately ten seconds after I docked. I took out the first dozen or so guards easily enough thanks to my arsenal of massive shotguns and hammers but it seemed like every time I cleared a room of guards it exploded seconds after I left thanks to the enemy missiles mercilessly barraging the ship.\n\nSo I sped up my efforts, ignored the rest of the guards and made a dash for the prisoner. No sooner had I retrieved him and turned around to flee the ship than I discovered that the port I had docked at had exploded and my pod was nowhere to be found. I ran for the bridge of the ship hoping that perhaps if I took over I might be able to return fire and escape\u2026 only to arrive at the door of the bridge a second before it too exploded. It seemed that escape was no longer an option yet I continued to carry my prisoner and made my way to an empty room in the middle of the ship hoping (naively) that maybe the enemy would get tired of firing missiles at me once they had finished killing off all the crew and blowing up all essential systems. They didn\u2019t. Just as I decided that my best option would be to jump into space and abandon the rapidly exploding ship the enemy was kind enough to do it for me by firing on the room beside me and sucking me out in the void.\n\nAdrift in space and separated from my prisoner friend I used my remaining shotgun ammo to haphazardly propel myself to the airlock of the enemy ship trailing behind the exploding wreck. Just about making it before I ran out of oxygen and ammunition. Only as I entered the ship and paused to survey the situation did I discover that my pod was still in fact alive\u2026 albeit several kilometres away and spinning wildly. I remote piloted it back towards me, shot past the prisoner I was meant to be rescuing just in time to watch him die in the vacuum and docked at the same airlock I had entered. Where I was promptly sucked back into space for neglecting to actually exit the airlock before docking with it. As I picked myself up and returned to the ship for some hammer based vengeance on the crew I couldn\u2019t help but think that if only I had acted a little faster I could have saved that lonely man drifting out in the void.\n\n10/10 Would jump out an airlock with a shotgun again.\n\n----------\n\nIn short: It\u2019s a bit like Faster Than Light (with more forgiving roguelike elements) combined with any number of bullet hell shooters (with a more forgiving amount of bullets flying at you) combined with various stealth games (with, again, more forgiving stealth aspects). In shorter still: It\u2019s just excellent.\n\nI say forgiving because the guards don\u2019t actually kill you, they just knock you out and throw you out an airlock and provided this hasn\u2019t happened to you too many times before there\u2019s usually ample time to collect yourself with your shuttle and just return to try again. Killing the guards is usually more about strategy and a bit of planning than pure mindless chaos (though things can quickly descend into that) and since you can simply pause and take a second to plan things through at any time it never feels too panicky or hectic. The time limits before you get captured after being detected on all but the hardest missions usually do little more than add some urgency and desperation in your bid to capture the ship.\n\nWhere things get interesting is when everything inevitably goes wrong and you find yourself doing ridiculous things to try and make it home alive. Unlike Faster Than Light however barely scraping your way through one mission doesn\u2019t completely destroy the rest of your playthrough and you can get injured quite a lot before your character becomes too weak to face another spacing. The liberation missions are also so entertaining and challenging that it keeps you striving to unlock the next\u2026 like the one which starts you with two teleporters and no weapons on a ship full of shielded guards.\n\nYou can take easier missions and avoid the suicidal ones for casual play or just roam around the vastness of the galaxy looting random ships. This is what I did with my first character in hope of getting better equipped to deal with his personal mission but after a handful of poor choices his next spacing would be fatal so I ended up just stealing a smaller ship and \u2018assassinating\u2019 my target by blowing up his entire ship and watching him suffocate in space\u2026 which was satisfying.", "timestamp_created": 1506873371, "timestamp_updated": 1506873371, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35386592": {"recommendationid": "35386592", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995954497", "num_games_owned": 317, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 563, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506967528}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is an excellent mix of action and puzzles. You will need items to work the puzzles out, and the bullet time/pause mechanics let you do action movie stuff straight out of something like Guardians of the Galaxy. I could see some of the smarter players killing whole groups of enemies without even using a weapon themselves, just the gadgets. The game is easy to play, somewhat difficult to master, and rewards thinking out of the box as well as preparing yourself for each mission.\n\nAt the same time, it does have some problems. The environments are too detailed and colourful compared to how much you can actually interact with them. For the most part, you will feel like you are playing 2000s flash games from Newgrounds. Also, the random character creator is fun, but does not lend itself to great plot depth. In a sense, it is a more forgiving X-Com: you can make your characters quite deadly through your own skill and by building up a respectable inventory of weapons and gadgets, and you can grow attached to them when they have quirky names like \"Dorado Comfort\" or \"Angel Voidborn\". However, the characters are pretty much expendable and their personal narrative is just one mission, after which you can retire them. It is not something atrocious or game-breaking, but it does lend itself to accusations of shallowness.\n\nShould you buy this game?\n\nWell, do you want to play a Guardians of the Galaxy/Matrix/Max Payne-in-Space badass?", "timestamp_created": 1506872806, "timestamp_updated": 1506872806, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35385722": {"recommendationid": "35385722", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997342413", "num_games_owned": 313, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 344, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507162719}, "language": "english", "review": "Closer to Hotline Miami then FTL, great game.", "timestamp_created": 1506871994, "timestamp_updated": 1506871994, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35385329": {"recommendationid": "35385329", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014586586", "num_games_owned": 406, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 1329, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508315565}, "language": "english", "review": "Hands down one of the best games that came out in the past year.\nGameplay: 9/10\nGraphics and sound design: 8/10\nOptimization: 9.5/10\nStory: -\nReplayability: 10/10\nInnovation: 9/10\nOverall enjoyment: 9/10", "timestamp_created": 1506871326, "timestamp_updated": 1506871357, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35383127": {"recommendationid": "35383127", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042537457", "num_games_owned": 182, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 70, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506867134}, "language": "english", "review": "\nWhen i read reviews talking about how its similar to FTL i hoped i could take enemy ships apart by maybe setting fires , destroying the oxygen supply , the power generator or maybe atleast some lighting?

Every aspect of the game is built to generate those. It is a very awkward design space and will not be for everyone, but if it clicks for you, it is incredibly addictive.\n\nThe basic gameplay loop is you take a mission to break into a ship, you fly there, break in, and attempt to get from the entrance to your objective with as little fuss as possible. This might mean you slow-mo shoot as many guards as you can, or creep through beating them unconscious with a wrench, or teleporting through with a cloaking device to try to avoid getting seen, and so on and so forth. The options you have are limited to what the guards are resistant to crossed with what tools you have randomly found, with the bare minimum always being how full the ship is of exploding rooms and windows to space.\n\nThe randomness of your options is key to the game. Death doesn't mean much, nor does failure. You are only good for about five successful missions MAXIMUM with any character before it is time to retire, so the fun of the game is in working your way up from basic gear through luck. You eventually unlock top tier gear at your shop, but having a reliable loadout is the opposite of fun. Heat Signature is about using a wrench and five types of teleporters you randomly scrounged up to take down an elite ship and then throwing the wrench out the window to leap into space with your goods. It isn't about having infinite armor piercing ammo and an infinite shield disruptor to clean ships like you're a heavily armed Roger Wilco.\n\nThat's what Heat Signature asks: That you stop caring about making optimal plays, that you try to break into ships you know you can't handle because it's a lot more fun that way./", "timestamp_created": 1506820883, "timestamp_updated": 1506820883, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528509", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35359565": {"recommendationid": "35359565", "author": {"steamid": "76561197985904075", "num_games_owned": 398, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 560, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506752030}, "language": "english", "review": "Heat Signature is a fantastic game.\n\nFrom the creator of Gunpoint, it's an interesting mix of roguelike and hotline miami with a dash of persistent gameworld thrown in.\n\nThere are a lot of fun elements sprinkled in but the \"meat\" of the game is completing various jobs with a variety of objectives and conditions.\n\nEach character is generated with a personal mission that they work towards - upon death or capture you can pick up as another character within the world.\n\nThere's an interesting approach to persistence - you slowly liberate stations and unlock new weapons and mission types as you play in a given galaxy, which provides a drip feed of new mechanics to keep you on track.\n\nThe space physics are neat, and like in Gunpoint, there are a variety of interesting gadgets and gizmos to play with here. \nShooting a hole into space might suck a room full of guards into the cold abyss, but it could also be a last ditch escape in a time of need.\n\nThere are some \"friends list multiplayer\" mechanics reminiscient of the ones in Shadow of Mordor through steam integration including naming a weapon to dump into the world.

You start ou small, get better stuff, get bigger missions, all great. But as soon as you go above \"hard\" missions, they jump from \"medium\" (what hard really is) to \"what in the living f*ck is this, f*ck this game\".\n\nI think the main issue is that you have nothing that really works against shields. Shields are equipments many thoughter enemies have that reflect any kind of attack. They come in two variants: One is active as soon as they spotted you, which is fine, it just means if you have been spotted, you better run because forget fighting back, hide until they go back to neutral. The other variant is always on.\nNow, there ARE ways to kill shields. There are two types of tools against them, one just turns them off and one inverts them so their own shots get reflected inwards, which is pretty sweet. The problem lies in the numbers. Even \"high capacity\" variants of those tools come with just 5 uses, and the time when you actually encounter those enemies, they're on huge ships with many guards meaning those 5 uses are gone pretty quickly with still plenty of shielded enemies around. (there are a few other ways, like blowing out a window next to them, but they aren't really applicable most of the time and means you also lose everything the guard holds, like keys)\n\nThere are two types of enemies, common and boss. that just means the boss ones got slightly better equipment and are a fifth in number. mostly just those got shields, but for the highest level difficulty missions I've seen yet, there are many where every enemy type has shields (and proximity sensors and so on).\nCombine that with a pretty short time limit, armor (which you can only ever defeat once you unlocked armor piercing weapons, which is btw way too late, before that you have to just not do any of those missions), huge ships and plenty of guards and it's becoming pretty much impossible.\n\nSome tools are rechargeable, which means they get filled up when you visit a friendly station. The one time I finished off a ship full of shields, I had a high capacity rechargeable, and pretty much killed 5 enemies, went to the nearest station, came back, killed 5 more.. took tons of time and is not what I'd call fun)\n\nEither the game should make it easier to get self-recharging tools (which you only see very rarely, I think I only saw them in special \"deflector missions\" which are sepparate from the rest), vastly increase the limit of uses (high capacity should be 20 uses minimum) or give us weapons that can bypass shields. You could go the way plenty of scifi went and only make lower speed weapons penetrate, like melee or even just slow types of melee.\n\nAlso, the time limit should be expanded or at least being spotted should not reduce it even more so you could rambo through to the captain, because in 9/10 missions with time limit, I was either caught or had to abandon the mission incomplete.\n\nAnd before someone says to just not do such missions: you get 5 missions to chose from, maybe 6. if 3 of those have shields and/or time limits, you're stuck with some \"medium\" and \"hard\" ones that are actually a piece of cake and pretty easy. \n\nEach time you get spaced, which means enemies killed you and throw you out the airlock, which is a nice idea in and on itself because it's a middle way between permadeath and just restarting at a checkpoint, the amount of time you can survive outside decreases. Would be fine if it was just for that mission, but it's permanent and I know of no way to increase it again, which means by the time you got all the equipment to tackle harder ships, being spaced once or twice, which will happen far easier, means you're dead.\n\nRestarting at the start of the ship, maybe even through the menu, the way it is with deflector missions would be great. Some times you have really bad luck with the layout and, for example, a group of five enemies right in front of your entry point. Some times you manage to blow up part of a ship which makes it impossible for you to go further into it. Both cases mean you just have to abort the mission, which is no fun.\n\nGive a faster way to travel through the huge ships. maybe teleporters unlocked when you reach them. it's really frustrating having to wander through the whole ship again just because you forgot a guy or something.\n\nLast but not least, lower the difficulty of personal missions. with like 20 characters, I survived that maybe once.\n\nto recap, ways to improve the game:\n- weapons against shields or at least higher capacity or recharging for tools\n- more self-recharging tools, period. One deflector mission had just glitch trap and a swapping teleporter (teleports you to where the enemy was and the enemy where you were) and I had a blast, setting the trap, standing on it and swapping with an enemy. But with the limited number of tools you can take with you this is not possible to really use without self-recharging tools.\n- quicker way to get armor piercing\n- longer time limit or less missions that have one\n- a way to \"heal\" yourself to withstand space longer again\n- add teleporters\n- lower difficulty level for personal missions (if all of the above get implemented that may not be neccessary)\n- a way to restart a ship, reroll it's layout\n\nsome additional points:\n- fix the memory leak or whatever is responsible for the game getting sluggish after some time running. At several points it was nearly as slow as while targetting.\n- Add a cheap ship type, like $5 or so, that would be a dinghy to your normal ship with which you could ram through windows if you go at them at full spead, sacrificing it but being able to start the ship where you rammed in it. could maybe alert the ship to make it not too easy. [note, maybe there is such a ship, I haven't unlocked all yet]\n- add some more options for those wanting to ghost. like a hack tool that would hack access hatches to air ducts with shich you could bypass enemies. a way to lure enemies to your trap without causing alarm. light switches or fuses you could turn off so enemies would not see as far. always just cloaking or teleporting is boring and costs a shitton.\n- after the enemy spotted you, followed you and lost your trail, make them return to where they were. otherwise you some times get 8 enemies in a single spot you need to go through\n- with how much emphasis there is on teleporting, teleporting grenade launchers should be included.

The humor is still there, certainly, but Gunpoint had it much more featured in the main part of the game.\n[*]Guards are a little predictable in their behaviours. I would have loved to see a bit more put towards their neutral patrols on the ship before any alarms are raised.\n\n\nOverall, if you liked Gunpoint you'll enjoy this one. I've gotten about 11 hours out of this already, and I imagine it'll be a fun game to pick up and replay every so often.\nIf you're on the fence about Heat Signature, and haven't played Gunpoint, go check out Gunpoint first.

There are a multiple elements that give each randomly generated missions a different flavour, like hijack, capture, and assassinate. There are different conditions to missions like bloodless (kill no one) and enigma (no witnesses). The overarching goal is to complete these missions in order to influence nearby space stations to liberate.\n\n[h1]What this game does well[/h1]\n\nThere are a lot of great games out in the ether, that tend to flop because they don't know how to tie all the elements together; when the gameplay just becomes a mess. This game however sets out to do exactly what it intended on doing, and keeps things simple for the player. There is no long tutorial, no need to explain everything, they just tell you how to do the basics, and the rest is an open sandbox to your imagination.\n\nAlthough the game has typical indie graphics, they play with the colour scheme and art design well to keep it visually appealing. The art direction here is well done, giving you a true feeling that you are out in space, and keeping the action looking interesting. One thing I would criticize, however, is the icon for who is carrying a key is currently white and often gets lost in the flooring. There have been a few times where I have spent 5-10 minutes wondering if a key holder got sucked out into space when it was actually on the floor somewhere.\n\nWhere this game really shines is in it's gameplay. As I said earlier, it is simplistic, and only becomes complex with your imagination. The core of the mechanics are easy to use and feel natural. The game provides you with tools to complete missions and you use these tools to completely missions where the odds should crush you. When you first start out playing, you tend to stick around the easy and medium missions, maybe if you are feeling ballsy you may try an hard mission. As you continue playing, you figure out different ways to use the tools they provide... whether it be a subverter, a sidewinder or a glitch trap... You end up being able to take on \"Mistake\" missions, and really enjoy the challenge. It is during this time that the game feels more exhilarating... when you clear a room of enemies, teleport across the map, dodge a few bullets, kill a guard then take out the pilot with 1 second to spare, it is delicious.\n\n- Simple\n- Pretty\n- Fun gameplay\n- Skilled gameplay\n- Intense moments\n- Creative problem solving\n- The missions variety\n\n[h1]What this game does bad[/h1]\n\nThe biggest problem with this game currently by far is it's lack of variety in content. If my count is correct there is currently only 4 types of ships to board. (I haven't tried a liberation missions yet, I will add my thoughts on that here). There are really only 3 types of weapons, with 3 types of ammuniction. There are 7 gadgets in the game currently as well and 6 enemy variations. You can really see all there is to see within about an hour of gameplay. Now, I am not say that the lack of variety has made it not fun... but I feel like I am just waiting for the game to become repeatative, like it is an inevitable final destination. The developers really need to come up with more contents, and really more things to do in the game. Currently there are 3 things you can do, missions, defector missions and just flying around hijacking ships at will. The problem is none of these feels any different, it is the exact same gameplay. The game really feels like it is missing something.\n\nI think the developers really need to add more depth and more options to boarding ships. Currently, all you do is fly to the ship, go to the one opening and dock, that is it. It would be interesting if they could incorporate some amount of gameplay into actually boarding the ship. Maybe defense drones you have to avoid, more ways to breach the ship, more things to actually do in space! Also, flying the your pod is pretty awful... which I kind of like, but don't at the same time. It makes pick up your guy in space challenging which is enjoyable... but smacking into the side of the ship repeatedly trying to dock is not.\n\nAs I sort of mentioned above, the game seems like it will get repetitive, and I am dreading that moment. I am currently quite enjoying this, but I can totally see this issue waiting on the horizon... I don't want this game to feel repetitive, I want to keep enjoying it because it is a good game.\n\nThis game desperately needs more stuff to buy. There is really nothing I ever want to spend money on. The only thing I buy is my upgraded pod, a silenced gun and then just dump into mystery crates. Let my by a damn ship already. Let me buy upgrades for it to attack/breach ships. \n\nI like how the AI functions, but currently they are way too basic and predictable. It would be nice to have some variety of AI on the ship, maybe assign roles randomly. Give the AI tasks to do around the ship, instead of standing facing each other. It would be neat to see actual designated rooms in the ship that change how the AI acts. For instance, a mess hall, barracks or nav room. Currently there is just an engine room and the cockpit. I want to see AI doing meaningful tasks, and have some AI that patrol the whole ship on hard difficulties, or AI that walk around in pairs... so, on. Maybe some defense drones that require more than 1 bullet to kill.\n\n- Content variety\n- Ship boarding/flying\n- Repetitiveness\n- Nothing to spend money on\n- AI issues\n\n[h1]Summary[/h1]\n\nHeat Signature is a ton of fun, and really allows the player to problem solve. It has some great visuals and makes you feel like you are getting better at the game. The intense moments really make you feel powerful when you beat the odds, and the challenge is incredibly fun. The game falls a little short when it comes to variety and has the potential to feel repetitive. Currently, I would recommend the game for its current price, but it may be best to wait and see if the developers plan on adding more content in the future. Although they are selling the game a finished indie game, it does feel like it is in early access.

Now that this is out of the way, we can begin commenting on the actual story.\n\nThe game begins in a manner reminiscent of Gunpoint - with someone getting thrown out the window, as the player assumes control and hijacks an interstellar vessel, only to fly it back to a space station build inside a floating meteor. After that we take control of a handful of proceedurally generated characters and begin our adventure as a cosmic mercenary out to liberate their nebula from the tyranny of the four majour factions by breaking into ships and acomplishing objectives for fortune or revenge. The gameplay systems will be familiar to anyone that played the hotline miami series, with a few major differences such as the abulity to slow down/stop time to aim one's shots and the addition of the abulity to remote control one's space pod while one resides in the ship's corridors. \n\nThe mechanical engagement peaks within the first few hours, as the player realizes all the possible strategies that one is able to acomplish within the given framework. For example, remember that I told you that it's possible to remote control one's space pod? Early on, one of the unlockable pods give one the abulity to ram it into the hull of a ship, damaging it and opening a new entryway for potential breaching in the process. As a result, it's possible to try to avoid being cought and take the standart path or engage in guerilla tactics as the flying brick flies through the observation window and into the deck of the vessel. Part of the fun is discovering the most unconventional solutions to common missions, such as hijacking a seperate vessel and ramming it into one in where your assassination target resides, etc.\n\nI'll admit, picking a warsone mission for the first time, trying to rescue a young woman while fighting off guards in narrow corridors, as the ship depressurises from a torpedo, sending you and your target flying into the vacuum, as the ship scoops the both of you up was one of the best gaming experiences I had in a while. Nevertheless, the toy box dries up in about 4 hours as progress slows to a crawl.\n\nOn a seperate note, one of the more interesting features is the procedural storytelling system. When picking your character, they recieve a one-sentence pitch of their personal goal (saving their sister, avenging their father, etc). After completing a certain number of difficult tasks, the process by one liberates space stations slows done, as your character becomes a celebraty and you are incentivised to retire and pick the next rookie that lacks all of the shiny gear that you have accumulated. As they retire, they are allowed to name one of their items after themselves, increasing the chance of it dropping and being seen to other players. Add to that, should one of your characters be taken captive by an enemy faction, their relatives might step in to set them free, after which they end up becoming playable again. Over the course of the session, that ends up manifesting itself as a sort of accumulated mythology of your world with its own set of heroes and martyrs with geographic locations and precious artifacts holding onto their names.\n\nAnyway, after about 10-17 hours of playing, you may be ready to take the stronghold of the last major faction and give political independence to the cosmic bowl of space gas. The stronghold missions usually involve breaking onto a large ship and changing its tragectory to collide into the enemy base, causing traumatic memories for any New Yorkers in the process. [spoiler] After escaping the structure with the skin of one's teeth or comitting an act of martyrdom, you return to one of your bases to hear a somewhat lax conversation about being manipulated by an even larger faction, upon which the game ends with a brief cutscene. Considering how top notch most of the lore and flufftext were, it was dissapointing to see such a rushed conclusion to a 15 hour experience. Plus, it doesn't help but to cause a bit of ludo-narrative dissonance, since it's hard to believe that a band of cutthroats that spend the last week being blasted into the void in order to save their familly and loved ones would just sit by and watch as their home is conquered by a force as they drink scotch in some rundown asteroid bar.[/spoiler]\n\nOverall, it's a solid game and is well worth the asking price, yet I can't help but urge others to try to wait for a few months before a few major updates arrive and the major bugs get patched out. Frankly, I hope that the developer adds a few more content updates, since there clearly isn't enough variables for an experience that has way overstretched its boundries. I hope that Tom keeps polishing an already excellent game into something special throughout the year.\n\nMaybe space station missions, new factions and techniques of storytelling?

I've been exposed to all manner of good and bad roguelike/procedurally generated games (probably my favorite genre), more than enough to make me wary when these titles are released. Noticing Heat Signature pop up in many places, I decided to actually WATCH the launch trailer on Steam and found myself completely sold. Purchased on impulse and have been absolutely absorbed ever since. I literally daydream about playing this while I'm at work.\n\nHeat Signature is an amazingly creative game. The emergent mechanics it sells itself on are absolutely no joke. You will lose great characters on missions you thought you could absolutely handle because of shit you really should have paid attention to. Sometimes you'll be backed into a corner and forced to try something RIDICULOUS, then feel like a living sci-fi legend when it all pans out and soon you're puttering home across the nebula with an unconscious capture target drooling in the back of your pod and your pockets laden with all of his nice stuff.\n\nThe core gameplay loop here is enthralling. Not exactly perfect, though the Dev has indicated willingness to carry on tweaking post-release. Hopefully we see some modding tools or something of the sort - Heat Signature's long-term appeal is proportional to its variety. Variety, in a procedurally generated game, scales exponentially with content and content is something gamers like myself would be thrilled to contribute.\n\nI only give this game 9/10 because I don't want to come off as fanatical, but it is really damn good.

Different weapons, gear, and approaches all make for a good time. You can go the lethal route or the non-lethal route as well, adding even more variety. \n\nI did however notice one big bug. I left the game on pause for a while because I felt like reading, and when I came back to play, it was running RIDICULOUSLY slow. I dunno if there's a memory leak or what, but this is defintely something that needs to be fixed.\n\nAlso, while I said there is indeed variety with missions and what not, it did feel kind of stale after an hour or two. While there are still definitely a bunch of different missions to do, they all kind end up being the same thing. Find the ship, board it, knock out/kill anyone in your way, and press  either F or E on the objective. Then go back to your home to collect money. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat.\n\nAs for the liberation stuff, I have no idea what I'm supposed to do with it. Capture the bases? But then you can do a mission after at each one? What do they even mean? \n\nI also got sick of the blood-whatever missions, which took up like 2 to 3 out of the 5 options of missions to choose from. These mean you can't kill anyone except MAYBE for the target, depending on if it's an assassination mission or not. I wouldn't mind this so much, except the two spots of available missions they took always seemed to be the medium or hard ones. That made so if I wanted to just have fun and kill, I had to pick the easy or other medium missions, earning me less rewards.\n\nAll in all, this is definitely a fun game, but it feels more like the beginning of game. There needs to be more content that adds even more variety, rather than just changing the mission from rescuing to killing to picking up. Maybe sabotage? Maybe have some missions on bases rather than ships? (I only played for a little bit so it's possible these things are in later game, but if you have to slog through the same kind of missions over and over to get it, it's still not worth it.)\n\nPlease add more to the game. The abiltiy to actually do something with the ships you steal, like space combat perhaps? Maybe getting more rewards for actually stealing a ship?

Or, perhaps, you would rather leave your foes alive, quietly knocking them out and dragging their limp bodies to an obscured corner.

Assassinations, captures, thefts, hijackings. \"Liberating\" stations. \n\nThis game has a massive, amazing sandbox structure, but also has a sort of story: each character you use has a personal mission, such as rescuing their brother, stealing a macguffin to help their family, or getting revenge on some vicious jerk from their past. \n\nThis game is fairly simple: You accept a mission, fly to the ship your objective is on, and perform the objective. Complete enough missions, and you can liberate a nearby station, most of which give you some form of upgrade. Then, after taking several stations, you start to unlock harder difficulties of mission, and different contract modifiers, both of which increase the pay, increasing the rate at which you liberate stations. Contract modifiers include not being allowed to kill anyone, not being allowed to be seen, et cetera. After a while, you can retire a character, and they give an item in their possession a special name, and a tag saying who owned it, which can then be found by you, or your steam friends. \n\nThe game has incredibly good and very simple mechanics, which allow it to be fun both in combat, as well as in stealth. It also has a vast array of gadgets, each with many variations. Missions also have many variations, both aesthetically (determined by what faction you are fighting), and mechanically. Sometimes, the ship you are going after is under attack by a third party, or has disgusting amounts of guards, or has guards that are impervious to normal weaponry.\n\nWhatever happens, though, is up to you.

I went on 3 missions, and netted enough equipment and cash to buy the information for my mission:\n\nAssassinate the guard who tortured my mother!\n\nMy first attempt ended in disaster, with Hotmatrixx's character escaping with a mere 3 seconds left before capture again (by my hand!) before being ejected out of the airlock.\n\nThe second trip out was on an even larger ship, but thankfully the same guard kits (naked concussion guards with keys, and emergency shields with concussion shotguns - how lucky!).\n\nI limped to a home base close by the mission, a few Slipstreams shorter, and launched the mission. I arrived with a whopping 130 seconds to take care of business.\n\nDuring the second mission, I received:\n- Self-charging 3/3 Long Range Crashbeam\n- Silenced Quickfire Shotgun\n\nAnd wait for it:\n\nFIASCO'S FACEBREAKER (insanely rare, quiet, fast, armor piercing, long range, knock out fist weapon!\n\nThe brilliant part about this? I got Fiasco's Facebreaker from ANOTHER Steam friend's game (BunkenDradger - THANK YOU for retiring that weapon!).\n\nWith 90 seconds left and fully equipped, I set to tearing the ship apart, one guard cluster at a time. The facebreaker feels.so.good.\n\nUltimately, I arrive, punch out each of the remaining guards, saving my target as the last to go down, to bring about the full bar of terror in him, and kill him with my bare hands.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1151894810\n\nRECOMMENDATION:\nJust buy this game and stop reading reviews. \n\nThere are so many different ways to play this game, and the lightly interconnected characters are amazing, from friends' items to a dad rescuing his son (and the son was one of your previously lost characters, which if successfully rescued, you can play as again). \n\nYou can go crazy and kill everything all the time, or you can be super sneaky and ghost your way through.\n\nYou can blow holes in the sides of ships with other hijacked ships and dock in those holes. You can teleport hard to deal with guards into outer space. You can throw sticky grenades onto a guard and watch him carry it back to his group. \n\nThere's just... there's no end to the amount of replayability in this game. \n\nJust get it already. The first hours are pure bliss of learning the mechanics and seeing what's possible in those crazy \"oh-crap\" moments. \n\nAfter that, I recommend not sticking to one play style, or only playing with weapons you've found or hijacked instead of bought (cash becomes easy, and as you build up inventory of gadgets, you can do one style over and over easily - this gets grindy and boring). Or trying to take those mission objectives seriously - what if it were you? \n\nRegardless of whether you try and mix it up or care about the little stories for each character, the game mechanics are solid and amazing, the options at your disposal of achieving your objectives are practically limitless, and the steam friend integrations are brilliant. \n\nBuy it!\n", "timestamp_created": 1506747799, "timestamp_updated": 1506747799, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35321824": {"recommendationid": "35321824", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989075564", "num_games_owned": 766, "num_reviews": 53, "playtime_forever": 219, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507425860}, "language": "english", "review": "What a joy! \n\nI'm not sure there's a game that's made me feel more like a space ninja bad-arse than this.

So you start over with nothing... literally.  And you have to grind your way back up to getting decent items/weapons again.

Now obviously I am fairly biased, having followed this game's developement for such a long time. If this game was released in its very early beta stages I would probably still have been all over it. \n\nNow, with that out of the way:\n\nHeat Signature is a top-down, Hotline Miami-style stealth game in which you use your small infiltrator ship to dock with bigger space ships full of guards and carry out different kinds of missions. \n\nWhile I find Hotline Miami to be the closest comparison there are two major additions to the gameplay. First off: the game is set in a randomly generated galaxy that you can roam freely and gradually take over. Secondly, pausing the game not only let's you catch your breath and take in your surroundings, but also lets you line up shots and instantly swap items, making the challenge of sneaking through the various ships more based on figuring out a good tactic rather than twitchy, fast-paced action.\n\nThe game has a heavy focus on gameplay. \"Well of course it does! It's a game innit?\", well yes, but I'd actually go as far as to say this game has a bigger focus on player input than any other game I've ever played. While playing this game I feel like I'm making important decisions literally every second. Upon starting the game, you are not met by a loading screen, or a bunch of logos, or even a title screen. You are taken directly into the game.\n\n\"But this is a stealth game, right? Stealth games usually involve a lot of waiting.\"\n\nYes. Sometimes, like in most stealth games, you might want to wait for that one guard to take this particular patrol route before you continue making your way through the ship. This is where another one of my favourite features of this game comes to play; the fast forward-button. At any point in the game, you can press the F-key to speed up time. This will make even the longest travels through space last only a couple of seconds and also means that waiting for that guard becomes almost a non-factor.\n\nThis is what I love about this game. Everything is built from the ground up to make sure that the you are never bored and you never feel like you're just \"along for the ride\". It is what I feel every game should strive for. This is an interactive media and I would like if more games embraced that as much as Heat Sig.\n\nNow I could go on, gushing about all the different features and mechanics of this game, but since you're reading this review you've probably already seen the lauch trailer so it feels a bit redundant. This game is super cool. It has teleporters and space ships and hacking and swords and really, really, really good writing. \n\nBuy it. Play it. Then buy it again.

After a few good and a few failed characters, I decided that this prospective young lady would take a stand against violence. I did not accept any mission that involved killing, and not once did I kill a person, preferring stealth or knock out tactics. Unfortunately, on her 4th or so mission, Lacerta was captured by shielded foundry guards whom she could not knock out or run from with her equipment.\n\nBack at the bar and a little bleak, I noticed a familiar name by the counter, Angel Antares. Her personal mission: rescue her daughter. Her name and her mission went perfect, but unlike her daughter, I decided Angel wouldn't make the same mistake. Liam Neeson style, it was Taken time. With her two trusty pistols, Angel put down everyone and everything in order to prepare to rescue Lacerta, but her progress was slow and the ship she needed to raid held armoured and shielded guards. I decided a grenade launcher, pistol, a couple of sidewinders (clear path teleporters), and a swapper (switch teleporter) and stealth shield would get me through. \n\nAngel eventually survived her way to a windowed room only two away from where Lacerta was being held. The only gear she had left was a rechargeable high capacity slipstream from a cargo crate (slows down time, makes you faster), and a pistol. Thirty seconds until capture. In the room with Lacerta were three armoured guards, and two with shields. The mission looked like a bust, there was no way I could sneak back the way I came, even without the alarm on. Angel would lose Lacerta and probably herself, unless... there was one other thing worth trying.\n\nI had angel shoot the window and get sucked out into space, then ram the windowed room with her brick pod, quickly repair it, and make dock. The two had 16 seconds to escape now. Activating the slipstream, Angel sprinted in, grabbed Lacerta, and ran out dodging a hail of bullets, narrowly missing them. with 4 seconds to spare, Lacerta was secured in the pod and Angel ejected them both and flew to safety. Saving her daughter was her greatest achievement and marked the end of her career, she would retire leaving her daughter the heirloom of the slipstream, named Borrowed Time, that had saved their lives. Lacerta would re-enter fieldwork, maintaining her non violence policy, but this time she would be prepared and her retired mother would remain a living legend and a hero to the people.\n\nThanks devs for making Heat Signature, I'll recommend this game to anyone!", "timestamp_created": 1506712943, "timestamp_updated": 1506712943, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35308794": {"recommendationid": "35308794", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992381854", "num_games_owned": 282, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1597, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506795732}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is very Hotline Miami-ish, a fun game but I wish it took more from hotline miami, a lot of it is very slow paced, and in several parts of the game despite it being very open-ended, is slower than it should be. youll find yourself waiting around a corner for the next dipshit guard to stumble around it like the last 4 have.

"It\u2019s really easy to look at Heat Signature and say \u201cthat looks like Hotline Miami in space,\u201d and saying that is applicable to a point, but as you dig deeper in the game you find a much more challenging and puzzle-like system that rewards you for proper planning, use of a diverse set of tools, and great timing.\n\n[h1]But it really is like Hotline Miami\u2026[/h1]\n\nHeat Signature starts you out flying a tiny pod at super speeds across a portion of a galaxy to find a marked ship to latch yourself on to its hull in order to infiltrate and fulfill the objective of your mission. This could be something as simple as killing a certain person on board, but also could be something a bit different like having you steal an item or take over the entire ship.  Yet in the beginning, this is where it\u2019s really like Hotline Miami.  You won\u2019t have many weapons or items, and the enemies will be pretty easy to dispatch.  In all likelihood, you will be able to take them all out with your wrench and some swift blows to the head to fully take over the ship regardless of your objective.  Even if the crew has guns, holding a mouse button (or controller button) to ready your selected weapon will put you in a slow motion mode, which, with a little anticipation, will have you dodging their shots easily.  Then on top of that, getting knocked out or shot doesn\u2019t immediately kill you.  You\u2019re rendered unconscious and carried to an airlock to be jettisoned, but the only thing you\u2019ll need to do then is remote control your space pod to come pick you up and either drive you back to the ship, or take you home to start a new mission.  However, all of this starts to change as you move in to missions that are more difficult.\n\n[h1]The real game begins [/h1]\n\nTaking out a half-dozen guards wielding wrenches or pistols one or two at a time will seem like a joke as you get into the tougher missions of the game.  Every completed mission nets you some of the game\u2019s currency, with it's mysterious droplet icon, and increases the amount of \u201cliberation\u201d that you have.  Once you reach a certain amount of liberation, you can unlock a new station, which will give you various small bonuses like additional items available in the station's stores.  The end goal of the game is liberating these stations and defeating each faction in the galaxy along the way.  In this process, you\u2019ll also unlock increasingly more difficult missions that involve more rules and requirements on top of guards equipped with all sorts of life-ending tools.   Luckily, as you move along, you accumulate a nice collection of useful gadgets and weapons that make it possible to successfully complete these encounters.  Whether it\u2019s armor piercing weapons, items that disable shields (or hilariously turn them against their wielder), or provide you with various types of teleportation, you\u2019ll be much more capable as you progress.   But you are going to have only eight slots in your inventory, and most items will have limited ammo and charges, so what results is a scenario where you need to plan ahead, plan while you\u2019re on the mission, and come up with a completely new plan when everything falls apart.  \n\n[h1]I love it when a plan comes together [/h1]\n\nThe most rewarding aspect of Heat Signature is when you\u2019re going in to an extremely difficult mission where you\u2019re dodging around patrolling guards, making use of an inventory full of crazy gadgets and weapons, trying to do it all under a time limit, and somehow pulling it all off even when half of what designed doesn't actually follow the plan.  The huge ships you\u2019ll be running around later in the game and the complex scenarios you\u2019re put in will give the game a great shelf life for a something that has such a relatively low base price of $15.  It\u2019s fascinating how the game transitions from something so familiar to a game that requires ample pausing, planning, and essentially solving randomly generated puzzles.  Then on top of that, the game limits progression with a single character (assuming they don\u2019t die or get captured) by giving diminishing returns on the \u201cliberation\u201d resource after you\u2019ve done a certain number of missions.  This forces you to retire the character and start over fresh with minimal items, keeping the game interesting even after several hours of play.  It encourages the player to take risks and try more dangerous missions since no matter what the result, you'll have to retire that character to keep progressing. \n\nHeat Signature is and indie game that delivers way over its price point and has an appeal that grows on you as you play, standing out from other indie games that tend to lose appeal as you dig in deeper due to a lack of depth.  As soon as you discover some cool gadget, weapon, or technique you can do, it adds another option in the already diverse gameplay.   I didn't know until hours in that you can pickpocket keys off of guards and that opened up an entirely new level of stealth options that I had never before considered.  If it had just one more layer of gameplay, maybe making the stations have more interactivity or something relating to the galaxy map, and a more refined artistic and graphical appearance, it could easily pass for a AAA game on par with something like XCOM with gameplay that keeps building on itself in an engaging way.  I fully recommend this title and I look forward to exploring it further to see what other fun bits it contains.  \n\nIf you'd like to see more of my reviews, check out my curator page here: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/EndyoGaming#curation", "timestamp_created": 1506680994, "timestamp_updated": 1506680994, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35288545": {"recommendationid": "35288545", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030289327", "num_games_owned": 48, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1817, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507159751}, "language": "english", "review": "Buy this game.", "timestamp_created": 1506680306, "timestamp_updated": 1506680306, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497039", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35287280": {"recommendationid": "35287280", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050970713", "num_games_owned": 304, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 1663, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511380969}, "language": "english", "review": "[b]Game that blown me away...[/b]\n\nThis is something like out of Phillip.K.Dick or Stanislaw Lem S/F books.\nYou start on a small asteroid base where you can choose one of 4 characters you want to play.

Sometimes during your job while firing your weapon you may break the window and get sucked out of the ship in to space.Limited oxygen in your suit will let you survive for 20-30 seconds and in this short time you will need to remote control your pod to grab you back inside and continue your mission.Sounds really COOL!!!\nYou can teleport yourself, you can swap-teleport which means you can switch places with another guard patroling enemy ship, you can also by using your gadgets clone a key card or remotely steal keys.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHyizW-PaZg\n\n\nI\u2019m about to show you guys the quickest way to get mass hate on a Review of a video game. I dislike Heat Signature. Yes yes I know what you\u2019re all thinking \n\nBUT WHY!?! IT HAS A 94% APPROVAL RATING ON STEAM!\\\n\nWell that\u2019s why I\u2019m here, welcome to this episode of Indie Reviews. \n\nHeat signature is a game where you invade spaceships and either kill everyone on board, or not kill everyone on board. That\u2019s basically it. There are about 4 different mission types in the game, assassinate, Capture/Rescue, Steal, and Commandeer, each mission can have a different modifier to it, like \u201cDon\u2019t let anyone die\u201d, \u201cKill Everyone\u201d, or \u201cset off no alarms\u201d There are a couple more but you get the point. You don\u2019t have to listen to the modifier but you\u2019ll lose the Bonus you\u2019ll receive if you actually beat the mission the proper way.\n\nHeat Signature suffers from one major issue, the tutorial level is no different than a mission labeled with the \u201cMistake\u201d difficulty. A pretty bold statement I know, but as soon as you unlock the Concussion Hammer the game is already over. All you need to do is buy two of these, have one as your right click and have the other as your left click. You literally kill people so quick with this combo that the game is completely unplayable after that, just watch.\n\n\n\nAfter getting this combo all you do is blitz people, it takes all the strategy out of the game. Well what little strategy was in it to begin with. \n\nYes I understand, there are \u201cCool\u201d ways you can try and kill someone. But why would I waste my time doing that when I can also just get a silenced shotgun and kill everyone in a room with one shot.\n\nThis is why the missions start to feel repetitive, lets say for example you have the kill everyone modifier. Ok so get your Concussion Hammer and clear the ship in 30 seconds, stack everyone at a window and shoot it. \n\nLets say you have the don\u2019t kill anyone modifier, alright then just get your Concussion Hammer combo and then clear the mission in 30 seconds.\n\nWhat about a mission that is already on the way to a station? Alright just get your Concussion Hammer combo and kill everyone on the ship in 30 seconds then win. \n\nHow about a mission where you have to not set off any alarms? Alright just get your Concussion Hammer combo and kill everyone in 30 seconds. Even if the guards spot you, you kill them quick enough that they can\u2019t set the alarm off anyways. \n\nYou see what I\u2019m talking about? The game has no depth because it doesn\u2019t force you do play any mission with just shield guys, or just armoured guys. If you start seeing those mission, just don\u2019t play them. The only thing you\u2019re missing out on are some credits, but by the time you clear out one shield mission, I\u2019ve already cleared 6 missions without shield guys in it making me more credits.\n\nBefore you go saying I\u2019m robbing myself from experiencing the game, I\u2019m going to have to counter and say if I can come across an OP combo in a game and can beat the entire game with it without any effort that is the fault of the developers and the layout of the game, not the person playing the game. It\u2019s like I got a Raygun with unlimited ammo in World At War, would I just put it back on the ground? Fuck no, and neither would you!\n\nLets talk about the ships, they\u2019re all Procedural generated, which some would claim as increasing replay ability but I don\u2019t see them that way at all. They\u2019re all laid out almost exactly the same. Sure some are short, some are long but that\u2019s really it. The pilot location will change and the objective will move but that\u2019s really it. There are only a couple tile sets as well which doesn\u2019t help in turning the game into one endless smear of un-inspired content.\n\nHonestly I don\u2019t understand how all these people enjoy this game! There are 612 reviews on steam, and 30 of them are negative. \n\nThis one guy says \u201cIf you loved hotline Miami, this is everything it was and so much more!\u201d and I\u2019m going to disagree with him 100% This is not even close to the quality of Hotline Miami. Hotline Miami had tight controls, had prebuilt levels with increasingly difficult layouts, and it had an amazing soundtrack\n\nHeat Signature had un-responsive controls (Play the clip)\n\nIt\u2019s levels are a Procedural mess which look and feel exactly the same. I can\u2019t really critique the Music much in the game because it was unmemorable. The only one that I even remember, and I stopped playing twenty minutes ago was the soundtrack in the stations, because that\u2019s the place you\u2019ll be spending most of your time.\n\nWhat am I not seeing that these people are. Lets dive further into the problems of the game. \n\nI\u2019ve some people saying the game is like The Binding Of Isaac\u2026. This game is nothing like Isaac. There are a tiny amount of weapons, a fraction the enemies and nothing to keep your attention for multiple play sessions. I\u2019ve 100% The Original Isaac, and have Platinum God in the new Isaac, so I feel fully confident in saying Heat Signature is nothing like Isaac, and has no where near the content.\n\nFinally lets talk about RNG. Enemy ships can sometimes spawn behind the ship you\u2019ve boarded and shoot the ship. If you\u2019re unlucky your room will be the first one shot, you\u2019ll instantly die, and be warped into space. I\u2019ve lost two characters like this because I was killed before and didn\u2019t have enough time to get my ship to my character. It feels cheap and shitty when this happens.\n\nAnd sometimes you\u2019ll just glitch and shoot out of the ship\n\n\n\n\n\nSo is there even anything that I enjoyed about this game? Well, I can admit that the first thirty minutes I was hooked. I enjoyed my self quite a bit, and then the hour mark hit, and I started noticing the game wasn\u2019t changing. Then the two hour mark hit, and I started getting upset  because the game wasn\u2019t changing. Then the Three hour mark hit, and I was pissed because the game didn\u2019t change.\n\nAnd I guess I can say the General Concept of the game is at least interesting, but can I recommend this game? Absolutely not. This is the lowest I think I\u2019ve rated a game on this show, I\u2019m giving this game a 3/10.\n\nI don\u2019t even know if I can recommend to buy this game on sale, it\u2019s just left such a sour taste. \n", "timestamp_created": 1506646271, "timestamp_updated": 1506646271, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.402115", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35277544": {"recommendationid": "35277544", "author": {"steamid": "76561197966167786", "num_games_owned": 990, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 1410, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511391938}, "language": "english", "review": "I am awake.\n\nI am drifting in the vacuum of space.

But only for a second. I aim my gun opposite the fleeing ship and fire. BOOM. I hear the noise in my head, even though the sound of the firing weapon is lost and silenced in this void. BOOM. BOOM. BOOM. I fire and fire. The force of the gun pushes me in the opposite direction. Towards the ship. Every action has an equal and opposite reaction. BOOM. BOOM. I am now making this noise in my helmet.\n\nI am making headway. The ship is nearing. I can see my corvette docked at an aft port. I fire my gun opposite of that and soon find my hands clutching precious, familiar metal. I open the emergency canopy and crawl back into the safety of my cockpit.\n\nI pull my helmet off this time. It obscured my vision when I needed full situational awareness. I grab a silenced pistol and a long blade. I step back into the ship and start down the hallway. \n\nI was going to clean the lockers for the prize I was contracted to steal. Now. I just want to kill everyone onboard and scuttle the ship. I sneak up behind a guard that is gazing off into the distance. My long blade finds his heart and he falls.

This is not a bad thing!  I for one, cannot stop playing it. There's always the lure of one more grand adventure to keep me coming back for more.\n\n[b]Well worth its price.[/b]\n\nSo far my most memorable character started out in an attempt to avenge his murdered wife. Shortly into his career he was rendered unconscious, and on his trip to the nearest airlock, the ship docked with its destination, so he was hurled in jail instead. \n\nThus, his father joined the fray, and after an illustrious career, to the point where there was almost nothing that anyone believed he was incapable of pulling off, he rescued his son from a prison transport, and subsequently retired before he gained any further grey hairs.\n\nNow free, and wiser for his suffering, the son continued on with his own rebellious career, and eventually learned the location of his wife's murderer. Unfortunately, after infiltrating the ship, history repeated itself, and the murderer himself shot him, and he was once more carted off to prison, instead of being deep spaced.\n\nThankfully, his good friend decided to pitch in, and come to the hapless hero's rescue as well. His career was not quite as storied as the hero's father's, but was still an impressive list of hoodwinking and incapacitating, but without a hint of the bloodshed that so overshadowed the previous rescuer. It seemed that the lesson had been learned as well, for the next prison transport was kitted out with every available member of the personnel heavily armored, and a number of them equipped with shields to boot. With the help of an assortment of teleportation devices, and an absurdly powerful non-lethal shotgun, once more the hero was free of his prison sentence.\n\nNow free to pursue his vengeance once more, the hero boarded his quarry's new vessel, and ran about in a panic as he attempted to avoid being shot yet again. Finally, when close enough to his target and with seconds left to go before the alerted pilot made it back to base yet again, he tossed a grenade at his target's feet. With the satisfying sound of the murderer's armor crumpling in on his body still ringing in his ears, he blew out a nearby window with the man's own shotgun, and escaped into the void of space. The comforting embrace of his breacher pod surrounded him moments later.\n\nFinally, he was free to retire.\n\n[u]Now, downsides I've noted:[/u]\nAt least on my system, the game slowly builds up enough data that it begins to slow to a crawl. This is easily rectified by closing the game, and then reopening as soon as you notice the decrease in performance.\n\nI wish I could give my characters nicknames, for ease of reference, and to make it easier to tell the difference between their somewhat limited selection of randomly assigned names.

Shenanigans will ensue. A hot extract involving explosive depressurization, defenestration, then culminating in a high speed docking maneuver is likely.\n\n* (You always play as a lone vigilante character (no partner! or quirky gay FBI agent on your tail!), but I bet that you will likely play that same character as an idiot, a jerk, and definitely not a professional. Many a chaotic blood-soaked trail has started as an intent to play a non-lethal character.)\n\n** (Actually, I wonder if anyone reading this is familiar with The Stars My Destination. There's casual teleportation and a similarity to slipstreaming in that piece of sci-fi.)\n\n*** (You may think I'm exaggerating, but I've been on a ship, getting attacked by another ship, where it broke in half and separated from the other part connected to the thrusters.  \"Missile surgery\" is also a common enough anecdote amongst the player base.)\n\n\nIn all seriousness, I noticed from other comments that you will have a bad time if you assume you will always be killing everyone like in Hotline Miami, or that you can always stick to stealth. Specifically, harder missions will introduce enemies that cannot be dealt with directly (Armor, Shields), and you definitely can't casually save scum if your character gets discovered. Instead, you will need to be creative with your gear, and to come up with clever ways to get your self out of deep trouble (or end up trying to grind low reward missions and having a terrible time at it). \n\nBut if you like to examine gameplay systems and see how you can exploit the meta-game, Heat Signature will introduce unexpected moments where you will either feel like a hilarious idiot, or a sheer cheating genius.", "timestamp_created": 1506575788, "timestamp_updated": 1506750395, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35254749": {"recommendationid": "35254749", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993646063", "num_games_owned": 414, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 905, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508508398}, "language": "english", "review": "While Heat Signature's premise is pretty simple (Complete missions to liberate stations to take over the sector), the game itself is not.

There are leathal and non-leathal ways to deal with pretty much any situation. With the right gear you can even pretty much ignore enemies entirely. From tools that let you copy security keys from a distance to tools that subvert or knock out enemy turrets and  shielding to three different flavours of teleporters (Intantly move from one place to another [but not through doors], swapping places with someone else or teleporting anywhere within range for a few seconds). \n\nAll in all, I'm having a blast with this...

Once you unpause there will only be a fraction of a second before that guard shouts \u201cINTRUDER!\u201d at the top of his voice, alerting the whole ship.\nWhat do?\nThese kinds of situations are where [i]Heat Signature[/i] shines. The next thing in the chain is\n[list]\n[*] [b]Step 7:[/b] [i]Throw[/i] Guard 3\u2019s wrench at Guard 4, beaning him and knocking him out cold.\n[/list]\nThe game is filled with moments like this and there is a huge selection of modifiers to change the dynamics of the weapons and items.\n\n[h1] POSITIVES [/h1]\n[list]\n[*] Huge range of items to suit any play style. Want to go loud and proud? Take an armour piercing shotgun! Want to be nothing more than a ghost? Take a stealth shield and some teleporters! Want to really annoy the guards? Hack their turrets so they turn on their masters!\n[*] Excellent sense of humour. The game is created by Tom Francis, mastermind behind [i]Gunpoint[/i]. If you enjoyed the writing of that, you\u2019ll find many similarities here.\n[*] The gameplay is really not that difficult. When enemies spot you the game goes into slow-motion, giving you more time to react. You can pause the game at any time to assess the situation and mouse-over guards to see what they\u2019re holding and their alert status. Even when you get detected the game gives you a timer within which you can; A) Escape, or B) Knock out the pilot to stop the countdown.\n[*] Failure is a temporary inconvenience. There\u2019s no penalty if you fail a mission and if you play missions with clauses (e.g. \u201cBloodless\u201d \u2013 don\u2019t kill anyone) and you happen to fail the clause, you\u2019ll still get paid if you complete the main objective. Even getting a character captured by the enemies is a temporary affair, as you can then use another character to go and rescue them.\n[*] Characters are not persistent but the galaxy is. The more you play with a certain character, the less you will be rewarded. Instead, you are expected to retire that character once you complete their personal mission and move on to someone new, meaning you don\u2019t have to worry about the cool gear they have, as everything you have unlocked can be purchased by the next character.\n[*] Sharing items and characters between friends. When you retire a character, you have the opportunity to pass on a single item with a customised name. These items then have a chance to be found in crates or bought from stores in both yours and your Steam friends\u2019 galaxies. Likewise, if a character is captured by the enemy one of your friends can save them! (Beware though, if a friend saves them before you can, they get to keep that character and all the items. You lose them.)\n[*] Different enemy factions [spoiler](Offworld Security, the Glitchers, Sovereign, and the Foundry)[/spoiler] use different items and have different ship layouts, varying the gameplay. Higher difficulty missions also give these enemies extra buffs like shields, teleporters, armour and armour [i]that explodes[i/]!\n[*] Excellent sound design and music. Each item has a distinct sound so you know exactly what\u2019s going on. The music transitions between bright and peppy, grand and echoing and dramatic and fast-paced without ever seeming jarring.\n\n[/list]\n[h1] NEGATIVES [/h1]\n[list]\n[*] Limited level design. The ships all share the same basic concepts: small rooms with barriers, large empty rooms, long twisting corridors, etc. It also becomes easy to infer how the interior of the ship will look based on its exterior shape. If the ship is a long rectangle it will most likely have some long corridors with few rooms. If the ship is a triangle it will have many small rooms with corridors twisting between them.\n[*] Confusing/frustrating ships. Some ships just have long, winding corridors that are annoying to navigate when under a strict time limit. Other ships, especially those belonging to the Glitchers faction, are a jumbled mess of conflicting colours and objects that make it difficult to understand where enemies are located and what parts of the room you can actually stand in or hide behind.\n[/list]\n\n[h1] UNDECIDED [/h1]\n[list]\n[*] Minimal amount of story. For some people, story is the highest priority, others don\u2019t care. [i]Heat Signature[/i] has just enough narrative to justify its existence and make it interesting, but it\u2019s much more about the [i]experiences[/i] you have using all the different items and how you get yourself out of sticky situations.\n[*] Simplistic nature. The overarching goal is to complete enough missions in order to [spoiler]liberate all the space stations and stop the galactic war.[/spoiler] Considering a character can be started and completed in about an hour, less if you are skilled or particularly lucky, and the fact that there are many space stations, you\u2019re going to be grinding for a while if your only goal is to complete the game. \n[/list]\n\n[h1] CONCLUSION [/h1]\nOverall, I am a big fan of [i]Heat Signature[/i]. I\u2019ve been following its development from the beginning and seeing how it has changed is quite interesting. The game is well worth playing, witty banter between characters, a wide variety of armaments and gadgets with which you can complete your assigned tasks and that classic Tom Francis flair of knocking people out of windows.", "timestamp_created": 1506574167, "timestamp_updated": 1506574167, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.663883", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35254088": {"recommendationid": "35254088", "author": {"steamid": "76561198116189880", "num_games_owned": 91, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2964, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 456, "last_played": 1513747520}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutely love.

Noble causes, which give you your end objective.\n\nSo with objective in mind you'll spend countless missions gathering weapons, gadgets, pods etc, as well as liberating little asteroids with space ships on them, as part of an overarching objective. Eventually you'll get enough cash to take on your personal mission, which you've probably long since forgotten about.\n\n\"Board the ship, kill/capture your target, get out\"\n\nEasy enough right? Wrong. Because the second you boarded the ship you forgot to look at what the guards and bosses have in the information screen.

You always do. Whether it means kiting the guards to a room with a window, shielding up and throwing your wrench through the window to suck them all into space. Or rather, you might die and just start over again, not making the same mistake twice.\n\nMy suggestion?\n\nBuy it ASAP.

She was wildly impatient but very confident in her skills, these two attributes never more proudly displayed than when she decided to take her very first mission, a capture mission on a very large Sovereign ship. The client wanted it done with NO harm done, no witnesses, complete silence, a Ghost Clause, one that would be a Mistake to take. Musca took it anyway. Accepting the mission after glancing through what the guards were equipped with she noted that they would be able to instantly teleport to any suspicious activity within a certain distance. She bought a single Sidewinder, Stealth Shield, and Key Cloner to assist in subterfuge, as she had previously only been armed with a Wrench and Subverter, and having expended all her money she set forth. Boarding the pod, she took her time about boarding the targets ship, knowing it was in no hurry to dock with a station unless she set off an alarm, and Musca didn't plan on setting off any alarms. Reaching and boarding the ship with ease, she carefully planned her approach through two very open rooms, noting the guards that were holding keys. As per the clients clause, she wasn't to knock out anyone but the target, so she patiently waited, relief in the knowledge that time was on her side. The time came when the guard holding the key patrolled past, and she steathily slipped behind him, nicking the key and passing through the door to the next room completely unseen thanks to her stealth shield. Passing through the next few rooms with relative ease again thanks to her stealth shield and wit, Clawless froze as her stealth ran out a bit earlier than predicted. Now revealed in a room of four guards she swore and switched to the Sidewinder, unwilling but needing to use its single charge to run, rather wanting to save the last charges of her stealth shield for another crisis. She teleported down the hall and into an unoccupied room and breathed a sigh of relief, for a moment. However, she now was stuck. The ship was larger than she first realized and she came to see that she was sandwhiched between the searching guards she'd fled from moments before, and the cockpit room which was frequented by patrolling guards. She stood and waited, watching the patrols, planning all the while. Sneakily weaving inbetween patrolmen she came to the next rooms, forgoing stealing the key from a guards behind and instead copying the highest level key from a guard a bit away. Using the remainder of the Stealth Shield but thankfully finding a Swapper in a locked chest room, Musca planned her final approach, coming to a stop a room away from her target. She stood and thought, patiently and cautiously going through options and processes in her mind, landing on one a minute later as her target went on patrol. Throwing her wrench against a wall near the guard to get his attention, he broke patrol and wandered over, just catching eyesight of her, just as she planned. The target walked into the window'd room and using her subverter Musca reversed his shield and bashed him with the Wrench as she teleported it to her. The guard dropped his gun and Musca was successful, picking up the man's unconcious body and dropping him in a less conspicuous part of the room. Now, in her adrenaline ridden state after 20 minutes of skulking through the ship, Musca Clawless forgot something very important. The guards in the next room, who were equipped with the ability to instantly teleport to supicious sounds. Rather than throw her wrench against the window to space, she picked up the gun and shot, sucking her and the target out. Remotely operating her pod she deftly picked up her and the target in a single pass. However, just as she slowed and began back to a friendly station to deliver the target, a single lone guard passed by her pod at incredible speeds, and seconds later as she realized what had happened, it was already too late, the man had suffocated and the clause was forfeit.

ruthless as you want ie killing people via sucking them into space or sparing everyone by knocking them unconcious with a wrench. it is really a bummer to lose a character that youve worked so hard on. there are some bugs here and there but the game wasjust realeased so thats expected. as of now the only thing i would say is the game after youve beat it sometimes becomes a bit repetitive, yes ships are randomly generated but you judt become so skilled in the game that you do it and you are done woth it. hopefully the game expand and we will be able to do more. one suggestion i have is a larger varierty of weapons, and that for concussive weapons, and or wrenches, people can be awoken by their teamates, as because there really isnt a point or drawback of using any other weapon than a silenced quickfire armor-piercing concussive gun besides 16 shots, but if you have 2 of them then unless you are a bad shot then you probably wont run out of ammo. with that though you can pretty much take down anyone without a shield and kill them from the menu if need be. other than that i enjoy the game and look forward to where it will go", "timestamp_created": 1506545707, "timestamp_updated":

No item is really out of your reach because you can just teleport it to your position. These two things combined make the gameplay dull and uninteresting. It's a real shame because it seems there's been a lot of thought put into how you could plan and execute each mission using whatever tools available. I understand that later on the game spikes the difficulty by adding alarm timers, bigger areas and generally more complexity, but all of this difficulty gets more or less negated because you can always pause the game, so you never feel the urgency get to you.\n\nI usually enjoy puzzle and stealth games, but I couldn't bring myself to enjoy this when it feels like there's a focus on the wrong parts of the game. The idea feels like it could have been better executed with turn-based combat and otherwise a freedom to run around instead of forcing players to pause every time something new happens.\n\nThe controls also feel like they would have been better suited towards a gamepad than just keyboard and mouse, which just makes movement feel strange and unintuitive.\n\nI can't recommend the game personally, because I am not a fan of games that force you to pause, but at the same time it's my own fault for not reading the labels and descriptions.", "timestamp_created": 1506538013, "timestamp_updated": 1506538013, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.397662", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35247184": {"recommendationid": "35247184", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026317882", "num_games_owned": 437, "num_reviews": 102, "playtime_forever": 1003, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506535612}, "language": "english", "review": "Heat Signature is such a cool concept...and yet, for now, this game is only a proof-of-concept, and I think most people will be better avoiding it and play something else.\n\n[h1]A thumb up for interesting mechanics[/h1]\n\nAt first glance, you will love the game. You're a resistance fighter in space, and you're tasked with infiltrating ships to weaken the powers in place, and your deeds will inspire people to revolt and liberate their station from the oppressive powers of the galaxy.\n\nSo you rush in your small pod, latch yourself onto a ship, and then infiltrate it. Soon, you will find some cool gadgets or awesome weapons in the randomly generated cargo holds or the bodies of your enemies. Theses items usually have several effects and purposes, which mean you can combine several of those in clever ways to progress towards your goal. \n\nWhether you like to be stealthly or just go in all guns blazing, the decent array of items available and their different effects can be combined to suit both your playstyle and the current objective. \n\nSo why shouldn't I give you the game a thumb up ?\n\n[h1]A thumb down for lack of content[/h1]\n\nBecause past that first glance, after the first 2h ingame, you will notice the main problem of the game: it only has 2h of content. \n\nAfter theses first two hours, you will have seen everything the game has to offer to you. Once you've liberated a few stations, the game will have shown you every difficulty modifier or special enemy you can encounter. You will also probably have seen most gadgets (though not all their slightly different variants). \n\nBut the goal of the game is to liberate 40 stations, not just a few of them......which mean if you wish to see the end of the game, you will have to grind theses liberations one by one, for 15 to 20h, until you reach the ending. \n\nNothing new will happen, it's just completing the same kind of randomly generated missions over and over until you have enough liberation points to liberate another station.\n\nWorst of all, most liberated stations will provide you with a new permanently unlocked item in your shop, which mean that you will have more and more tools easily available (rather than randomly looted), to do the same type of missions, So the more you play, the easier the game will become, which will reinforce the impression of grinding and boredom.\n\n[h1]Not really a game, more like a proof-of-concept[/h1]\n\nUltimately, that \"2h game stretched over 20\" is not a critical failure. For 12 euros (or whatever your local equivalent), it doesn't feel like the game robs you. However, there is definitely a feeling that this game is just not finished. That it's just a proof-of-concept, with a bunch of features that were mostly not fleshed out. \n\nA very simple example of that is the \"Coldfire ship\" that you can unlock by liberating a system. It is the most expensive ship in the game (twice the normal price) because it has the special ability of being invisible to enemy ships sensors...which sounds cool in practice, but as soon as you play the game you will understand is completely useless. You're always asked to breach a ship from its backside, and the small range of sensors are always located on the front and slightly on the sides of the enemy ship, making them totally useless...it will be very rare for you to ever have to worry about them.\n\nThis and many others examples explain why, despite some cool ideas and a nice style, I can't really recommend this game. If you have time and money to spare on a so-so game, you might want to get Heat Signature and play it for a few hours.

The new Fair Points update helps, but there's still unexplained / inconsistent mechanics in the game. For example, for some weird reason I couldn't use my short sword to kill an unconscious assassination target. Or the defector missions: there's no explanation about what they're for and once you start one, you're locked into completing it when you can't return to your station. It's just confusing. The game's fun at times, but it still feels like I'm playing a beta of a game. This is a shame, since I love roguelikes and this game has a lot of fresh ideas and promise. I'll flip my review to positive when that isn't the case.\n\nPRO: If you enjoy stealth games, you'll approve of this one, especially if you liked games such as Dishonored, which give you flexibility to go in guns-blazing or be silent and sneaky. The roguelike element is clever: you can even play characters who have a personal mission of rescuing a previous character you'd played who got caught (and then you can play as the rescued character again).\n\nCON: It doesn't feel totally polished: items on the floor can be hard to distinguish from the background; ship interior design is a bit samey and repetitive; I've had some bugs, like where I warp out of the ship to my pod suddenly if the alarm sounds which is very disorienting; some of the mechanics could be explained better (it took me a second to notice the mission drop/chute thing in the homebase and it's not in the tutorial).\n\nOVERALL: The flaws can be addressed in patches soon (I hope).

It's great fun & you should just buy it for its unique qualities & genre redefining efforts.\n\n[i] Review as of 9/26/2017 [/i]\n\n[b]NON-PLOT RELATED GAME SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW[/b] Honestly, you should buy it. Everything after this is a criticism of mechanics you should discover on your own! Do not let them deter you from your purchase & do not read them in order to ruin your fun!\n\n1. The Stealth Shield is the best gadget. It needs nerf'ing & how could be one of many of ways. Ghost every mission, mistake level. Sidewinder equally will let you teleport in & out of rooms before being seen constantly. If your Galaxy's RNG allows you to unlock these gadget upgrades sooner, you will have an easier play through. If you do this constantly, the game gets stale, but it's objectively the best way to beat any mission, so... [u][b](Maybe make kill everyone clauses that aren't secure the vessel? Loud & banging send a message missions?)[/b][/u]\n\n2. Roleplaying is what makes this. I decided it would still be fun by more forced impositions. The mission clauses make point 1 way too seriously true. In my experience, I want Yanis, the plumber, to wrench his way through personal missions, a few liberations & to retirement. Wrench only. Non-lethal, he's freeing his family. In this light, it makes a good streamer game. [u][b](Maybe also give nicknames to characters, not just their weapons in retirement? The legend of LongBladeShortBlade is only for me rn)[/b][/u]\n\n3. There's a few redundant gadgets/weapons that are just inferior even if you need them. Can someone explain to me why you'd ever take a crashbeam over a subverter? It's just better & both are available out the gate. Equally, you can do melee only builds w/ armor piercing blades (Fair time to again point to the more than grenade related armour bugs the dev must know about via his YouTube videos) w/ 4-5 melee weapons & gadgets remaining. [u][b]More MOBs & kill clauses may make ranged weapons more viable[/b][/u]. It'll almost always be better than guns until you need to shoot out a window.  The time pausing is great fun, maybe with minor tweaks the difference between quiet melee & loud guns could be equal. I've also seemingly noticed different reaction times of guards- this would definitely make ranged more viable. [i]Alternatively[/i], just letting certain upgrades NOT be RNG'd to the start of your liberation map would work.\n\n4. Teleporting. Glitch traps may want to be timed per placing per use & recoverable instead of \"Use per MOB teleported\". 5 teleports of enemies is a waste of inventory always. Visitors may want a variant that's less than the 2 seconds it takes to get shot in a room full of people. Swappers may want additional traits as well, because you're just as likely to get a sidewinder, which is objectively best. The Glitcher pod is also objectively the least viable in most missions. Maybe more access points via keycard could make it matter.\n\n5. Last are a few laughable/Not game-ruining collision bugs. What gets sucked into the vacuum of space seems nearly random. It could be a MOB two rooms away during no kill or you could fail to eject your captured target right next to you. You can collide through ships w/ scaling pretty easily. That being said, a lot of the collision work in this game impresses me still. Compared to the completely unprecedented style of scale/gameplay, this is almost a negligible complaint.\n\n[u]All in all, if you didn't read my review, you'll enjoy the game for easily what it's worth by not trying to gamebreak or take the easy way out. [/u] It easily has 5-10 hours gameplay. I can't say I've finished all the strongholds & game, but largely out of my lack of interest to do so at this point.

She was captured by Glitchers while on a mission to raise the funds needed to buy the equipment necessary to kill the Foundry officer who murdered her daughter.\n\nCaeli Alphecca was a character who appeared in my bar with the personal mission to rescue her friend, Jazz Asante, from the Glitchers. I was informed that I would be able to play as LemonSoup's character, Jazz Asante, if I completed this mission.\n\nCaeli immediately got to work. She was not a good person. Caeli Alphecca had 0 knockouts on record because she would kill everyone she encountered. This monstrous methodology allowed her to quickly accumulate vast amounts of wealth and gear, and soon she was ready to take on her personal mission to rescue Jazz Asante from the Glitchers.\n\nOne ship of dead Glitchers later, Jazz Asante was free. She had a meagre inventory and meagre funds. But her daughter's killer was still out there, and she needed him dead before she could retire.\n\nEnemies on her daughter's killer's ship was armoured. Jazz worked her way through many missions to afford a silenced quickfire armour-piercing rifle. She also picked up a concussion hammer along the way.\n\nJazz was finally ready to confront her adversary. She boarded the ship, shot nine people, and made her way to her target. He was standing in front of a window. Ms Asante sheathed her rifle, equipped her concussive hammer, and smashed that bastard right through the glass into space.\n\nThe resulting vacuum also sucked Jazz into space, but she remotely piloted her pod to retrieve her. She was already docking at one of the ship's airlocks when her daughter's killer finally asphyxiated.\n\nThe fiend was dead, but his friends still drew breath.

It's the most thrilling fun I've had in a game all year.\n\n~~~~~\n\nI'm stuck on a ship facing enemies I can't kill. You see, they all have shields equipped, and I don't have any tech left to take out said shield, so they're impervious to anything I can throw (or shoot) at them.\n\nMy target is already dead. The captain is also already dead. I'm not at risk of getting captured here, I can just leave. But there's an enigma clause on this contract, and I want the extra coin. After all, I'm fighting to save my friend Mercy, and losing these credits is going to be a setback I don't want to risk. The clause says no living witnesses, and I'm stuck here with seven of them. Seven guards who've seen me, whom I can't even hope to kill.\n\nMy very last hope on this ship is a lone room with a viewing window. If I can manage to corral all the remaining guards into that room and break the glass, it's game over for them and a perfect contract for me. That's...a big ask. I don't have much to work with here, and it's not as if the guards will kindly and helpfully congregate in front of the window if I ask nicely. No, there are going to be bullets flying everywhere, and if even one witness remains I'm screwed.\n\nBut - I've got a shotgun.\n\nI can pull the guards to me by firing off shots from adjacent rooms. They'll come to investigate the noise, and I can lead them toward the viewing room. If I do it right, I can get them to bunch up. They'll cluster close enough for the vacuum to pull them all out at once, and if I go with them I can just remote pilot my ship and save myself. This could work!\n\nI move methodically through the halls, firing shots to grab the attention of the guards. Mercifully, they act as I'd hoped! They investigate the noise, moving as a group, all ten remaining baddies clumped up like some kind of shielded-shooty amoeba pushing itself through a maze of spaceship corrdiors. Finally, we hit the room I want them in, but I have to dodge down a hallway first, lest the leader of the pack shoot prematurely and hit the glass. When they all enter the room and are in range, I push back - but I'm cut off by three guards. They've spotted me, they're close enough to shoot me with no chance of dodging. I've only got one choice...\n\nI fire my shotgun.\n\nIn slow motion, I see myself get hit by one of their bullets and fall unconscious. I see my shotgun spray creep forward, hit the leader's shield, and ricochet toward into the viewing room. I hold my breath, praying for the sound of breaking glass. And CRASH - there it is. The viewing window breaks and all the remaining guards are pulled out into empty space. My body lay there bleeding as I wait for the recovery timer to finish counting down. I see the notification pop up saying SHIP CLEARED as the triumph sets in. I can't believe what I've just pulled off. I can't believe there's no achievement for this! \n\nI fulfilled my enigma clause, and got my full pay. A couple missions later, I freed Mercy and regained her as a player character, then retired.

Being able to zoom out to see the entire galaxy to zooming in on a single tiny pod is pretty cool. The concept of hijacking ships and kicking ass is pretty fun too. The novelty of it all wears off after a few hours, unfortunately.\n\nIt's not a bad game, it's just pretty bare once you get into it. There's not a lot of depth to it; you just have to hijack ships, do an objective, and get better loot. Then you liberate colonies, and that's about it. The ships are cool at first but soon become very repetitive despite its randomized nature. I see a lot complain that the guards are a problem, because most of the time there's groups of guards in single rooms, and one might venture out and become isolated, then you can pick him off. Rinse, repeat.\n\nI started to approach about every mission with a wrench because you can hit with it from afar and throw it, taking out two at once, initially. The game mixes it up a bit including shields and other things on enemies, which require specific weapons to deal with or some ingenuity. Like, you can lead these guards with impenetrable armor (again, unless you have a certain item) and shoot a window, sucking them out. Often times it's not the best choice, but it's there.\n\nThe retirement system seems cool at first but in the grand scheme of things doesn't really matter. The Defector missions are really fun and are probably the highlight of the game, but like a lot of things in this game, it simply doesn't matter. There's no benefit to defector missions other than fun; it doesn't contribute to your end goal in liberating the entire system. \n\nThe artwork is fine, I appreciate the little details thrown into the different factions but it (again) gets repetitive. Some of the textures when you move in become pixelized like a shitty jpeg. The game also has only two FPS options, 30 or 60, which is silly but maybe there's some constraint I'm not aware of.\n\nIf it looks like I hate the game, I don't. It's actually pretty addictive and I managed to put in ~14 hours into it. If the developer adds more to the game then I can see it becoming a really special game. At this point though, there's a sort of novelty to it that wears off way too fast.

Disengage my pod, and start inching my way over toward the windows from the outside of the ship. Not too close, because normally, windows also act as searchlights, and if you go in range you get seen and exploded. I hover around the side.\n\n15 seconds pass. Enemy warship attacks my target ship. Just as I had hoped, a missile blows open the two windows, negating their searching capability and also turning them into dockable points for my pod. And also starting the 19 second panic alarm before mission failure.\n\nBut they're next to each other, and in the chaos of space, my pod latches onto the wrong one. This puts me two rooms away from my target, but with a wall between us. Nope. I back out and detach. A second after I detach, a missile smashes into the window I was in. That rips apart the entire ROOM from the ship, sending it spiralling away into space. Close call. 14 seconds left.\n\nI nudge my pod along the side of the ship, and latch onto the correct window. Pause the game. 11 seconds left. But no guards around! I run in to the first room, then adjoining room, pluck Zhaneta from her bed, and carry her back to the pod. 8 seconds left. Detach. Fly off amidst a shower of missiles and head back to base.\n\nJust another day in the life of a rebel fighter. And there are many more like that, tales of insane deeds performed by legendary heroes in subzero space with no living witnesses to corroborate their story.\n\n===\n\nThis game is very fun, and on top of that I really enjoy games where friends can impact your game - this game lets you find items left behind by friends when they \"win\", and lets you rescue and recruit characters left behind by friends when they \"lose\".\n\nI will briefly touch upon some of its key points that may not be obvious at first glance after reading its store page.\n\n[list]\n[*]It can, I suppose, get repetitive if you are always perfect. Part of the draw of the game is screwing up, then using the tools at your disposal to overcome a seemingly impossible situation. That is an amazing feeling.\n[*]It is more forgiving than it seems at first. As long as the enemies aren't wielding lethal weapons, all you really have to do to win a majority of missions is take the pilot out of the pilot seat, which nullifies any alarm timer. Then you can experiment, and even if you get knocked out by the enemy and tossed out an airlock, you can use your pod to catch yourself and come back in. And even go refill your rechargeables back home first if you like.\n[*]Look for the Offworld Angel pod in the liberation star menu, near your starting base. You want to liberate and unlock that ASAP (it's a great beginner/safety pod).\n[*]Subverters can unlock doors.\n[*]To progress the overarching nebula \"quest\", you will need to use many different characters, whether you win or lose with them. Once you have done too many missions with one character, they start contributing less to the global progress bar because they're too famous and don't inspire as much rebellion. Which is fine, it changes things up. I retire all my characters once (if) they complete their personal mission.\n[*]You can \"gear up\" without being on missions by just flying around the nebula and pressing right click now and then to look for nearby ships.\n[*]There was a bit of a learning curve bump between Normal and Hard for me, larger than the jump between any of the other difficulties. Don't give up right there though.

Where it differentiates itself, however, is in the tactics department. At any moment in Heat Signature you can pause the live gameplay and make an educated decision regarding your next move or action. This take on game tactics is further improved by the vast amount of options at your disposal during that pause in gameplay. \n  For example you could find yourself assaulted by two guards, one of which has just fired a shot at you. You could: 1) Use an item that swaps places with that guard, which will kill him with his own bullet and then dispose of the second guard while he is confused. 2) Teleport behind the shooting guard and knock him out with a wrench then fire a shot at the second guard before he figures out what is happening. 3) Use an item to slow down time then side step the bullet and dispose of each of the guards with your own gun. These are just three options which come to mind, but there are countless other ways to handle this specific situation.\n  The vast amount of variables and options create an amazing science fiction themed toy box for you to play around in for countless hours.

Also fun- hijacking and destroying parts of starships to add onto the Heat Signature Wiki.

Is it possible to add brakes to a starship, like in the pod, and change the missiles to a different key?\n2) Starship damage.

"Played this game a little and thought \"Hey, that's pretty good\". And then I decided to finish my char's personal mission, assassinate some guy for some good vendetta reason. Target was on a very large ship filled with tons of guards packed with deflecting shields, hiding behind 7 layers of locked doors, I was totally overwhelmed, because shield-removing options were limited and there were instakilling turrets also. So I ran, periodically copying enemies' keycards, until I reached my target with only 1 charge of shield remover left. I killed the guy and looked back to see around 20 guards converging on me. Thought about \"epic last stand\" for a second and then jumped out of illuminator and remotely controlled my pod to pick m up. \n\nTL;DR \u2014 game has tons of variety and is pretty challenging as well as enjoyable.

Pensei o quanto seria interessante ter uma mec\u00e2nica de invas\u00e3o e estrat\u00e9gia com pausa, como em Door Kickers, em um jogo com contexto similar a FTL e um tanto daquela esquizofrenia do combate de Hotline Miami. Acabei fazendo um mapa para Door Kickers chamado Boarding the Osprey (dispon\u00edvel no Workshop)... e isso justifica, provavelmente, minha autom\u00e1tica paix\u00e3o por Heat Signature. Se voc\u00ea gosta de FTL, Door Kickers e Hotline Miami, voc\u00ea vai gostar de Heat Signature. Um excelente jogo de a\u00e7\u00e3o/estrat\u00e9gia com pausa livre com mec\u00e2nica refinada, competente apresenta\u00e7\u00e3o visual e \u00f3timo pre\u00e7o.\n\nV\u00eddeo An\u00e1lise: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsR2ExB6wGg\n---------\n\nDos mesmos criadores de Gunpoint, Heat Signature (\u00f3timo nome) \u00e9 um jogo sobre invadir naves no espa\u00e7o e viver incr\u00edveis mini aventuras completando miss\u00f5es de roubo, assassinato, rapto ou resgate enquanto expande o dom\u00ednio de seu grupo pela Gal\u00e1xia.\n\nUma primeira parte do deslocamento no jogo \u00e9 atrav\u00e9s do espa\u00e7o. O jogador controla um personagem cujo principal meio de tranporte \u00e9 um Breaching Pod. Uma pequena nave projetada para abordar naves maiores. Uma vez atachado \u00e0 nave, o Pod se abre e o personagem est\u00e1 livre para desenvolver e executar sua estrat\u00e9gia para alcan\u00e7ar o objetivo.\n\nH\u00e1 diversas formas de completar sua miss\u00e3o. Voc\u00ea pode adotar um estilo furtivo e eliminar toda a tripula\u00e7\u00e3o sem ativar alarmes ou completar o objetivo sem matar ningu\u00e9m ou simplesmente portar uma Katana em cada punho e fatiar todos em seu caminho. Algumas miss\u00f5es ir\u00e3o impor cl\u00e1usulas especiais como n\u00e3o matar nenhum tripulante, n\u00e3o ativar alarmes ou n\u00e3o deixar testemunhas vivas, tais cl\u00e1usulas rendem melhor recompensa, mas n\u00e3o s\u00e3o realmente obrigat\u00f3rias.\n\nO sistema de estrutura das naves \u00e9 bastante simples (modular) e muito din\u00e2mico, sendo poss\u00edvel, por exemplo, partir uma grande nave no meio e transitar entre as duas metates durante uma miss\u00e3o enquanto essas metades cruzam a gal\u00e1xia em constante movimento.\n\nA constitui\u00e7\u00e3o c\u00eanica combina bem com a execu\u00e7\u00e3o do combate com pausa, dando ao personagem uma capacidade de resolver problemas limitada quase sempre apenas pela imagina\u00e7\u00e3o do pr\u00f3prio jogador. Voc\u00ea sentir\u00e1 que cada personagem \u00e9 poderoso na medida em que o jogador domina a mec\u00e2nica e os itens dispon\u00edveis para realizar a miss\u00e3o e usa a imagina\u00e7\u00e3o para tentar manipular a situa\u00e7\u00e3o. O retorno visual do uso de itens e armas \u00e9 tamb\u00e9m muito bom.\n\nA conforma\u00e7\u00e3o modular das naves e a apresenta\u00e7\u00e3o simples (mas competente) do jogo, assim como em jogos como Doorkickers e Hotline Miame, abrem incr\u00edveis possibilidades para modifica\u00e7\u00f5es (como edi\u00e7\u00e3o de naves e miss\u00f5es) e eu realmente espero que isso venha a existir no futuro.\n\nGal\u00e1xias s\u00e3o geradas proceduralmente assim como a distribui\u00e7\u00e3o narrativa. Existe um determinado personagem padr\u00e3o e quatro personagens aleat\u00f3rios com morte permanente. Cada um destes vem com sua pr\u00f3pria miss\u00e3o pessoal que destrava quando o personagem alcan\u00e7a os n\u00edveis mais dif\u00edceis de miss\u00f5es e entrega 200 pontos de dinheiro para o personagem que libera a miss\u00e3o pessoal. Assim que um personagem morre ou \u00e9 aposentado ele \u00e9 substituido por outro.\n\nA distribui\u00e7\u00e3o narrativa n\u00e3o vai al\u00e9m da contextualiza\u00e7\u00e3o breve disponibilizada por dois personagens e na miss\u00e3o pessoal de cada um. \u00c9 eficiente naquilo que \u00e9 o objetivo de sua exist\u00eancia para o jogo: contextualiza\u00e7\u00e3o mec\u00e2nica-narrativa e n\u00e3o mais que isso. Outra caracter\u00edstica compartilhada por Doorkickers e FTL.\n\nAo realizar a miss\u00e3o pessoal, o jogador pode aposentar o personagem que poder\u00e1 aparecer no jogo de outro contato seu na Steam que tamb\u00e9m possua Heat Signature, podendo tamb\u00e9m rotular uma arma deste personagem como lend\u00e1ria. Este item lend\u00e1rio poder\u00e1 aparecer durante outras sess\u00f5es do pr\u00f3prio jogador e tamb\u00e9m no jogo de contatos da Steam.\n\nPara cada esta\u00e7\u00e3o conquistada na Gal\u00e1xia, o jogador tem uma miss\u00e3o \u00fanica com limita\u00e7\u00e3o de equipamento usado. Fora essas miss\u00f5es (que n\u00e3o s\u00e3o obrigat\u00f3rias, mas trazem vantagens mec\u00e2nicas como novas armas e outros recursos), o jogador \u00e9 livre para adotar o estilo de equipamento que desejar ou pensar ser mais conveniente de acordo com o que ele destravou at\u00e9 o momento. \n\nCom esses elementos, o jogo promove um ambiente de agrad\u00e1vel a\u00e7\u00e3o com razo\u00e1vel dificuldade e boa curva de aprendizado com o aumento gradativo das dificuldades dispon\u00edveis para cada personagem. Os diversos estilos dispon\u00edveis s\u00e3o um est\u00edmulo a mais jogadores que gostam de mec\u00e2nicas que possibilitam experimenta\u00e7\u00e3o.\n\nAlgumas faltas que podem ser apontadas s\u00e3o:\n\n1 \u2013 M\u00fasica: Poderia ser muito melhor se fosse um pouco mais fren\u00e9tica com varia\u00e7\u00f5es din\u00e2micas durante pausas. Os sons do jogo s\u00e3o bons, mas a m\u00fasica realmente \u00e9 pouco variada e deixa a desejar.\n\n2 \u2013 N\u00e3o h\u00e1 imposi\u00e7\u00e3o de uma distribui\u00e7\u00e3o de pontos de habilidade por personagem. Apesar de terem miss\u00f5es pessoais e visuais diferentes, personagens funcionam da mesma forma, sendo o pr\u00f3prio jogador o respons\u00e1vel pela imposi\u00e7\u00e3o de limita\u00e7\u00f5es ou estilos distintos.\n\n3 \u2013 Personaliza\u00e7\u00e3o para compartilhamento dos personagens aposentados \u00e9 limitada.\n\n4 \u2013 H\u00e1 uma varia\u00e7\u00e3o para a forma visual das naves, mas todas as varia\u00e7\u00f5es (de acordo com a fac\u00e7\u00e3o) funcionam basicamente da mesma forma (exceto os pods pilotados pelos personagens jog\u00e1veis, cada variedade possuindo uma fun\u00e7\u00e3o especial).\n\n5 \u2013 H\u00e1 pouca varia\u00e7\u00e3o entre as esta\u00e7\u00f5es e miss\u00f5es n\u00e3o acontecem em nenhum outro ambiente que n\u00e3o seja uma nave. Isso \u00e9, claro, parte do contexto, mas seria interessante ter miss\u00f5es em esta\u00e7\u00f5es ou ambientes diferentes.\n\n6 \u2013 N\u00e3o h\u00e1 tradu\u00e7\u00e3o (at\u00e9 o momento) para Portugu\u00eas-Br\n\nMas a rela\u00e7\u00e3o de pre\u00e7o e qualidade deste produto \u00e9 uma das melhores entre jogos do g\u00eanero e de magnitude e complexidade similares. Um desenvolvimento de tr\u00eas anos que rendeu um produto simples, mas competente e muito divertido para aqueles que gostam de a\u00e7\u00e3o, estrat\u00e9gia com pausa e aventuras no Espa\u00e7o.

Yeah, odd name but does that really matter especially after you pull the sort of stunt she did?  I don't think so and if you ask me, others wouldn't either. \n\nWhat does matter is that stunt; her's was an interesting story, what with a daughter who fell into the wrong crowd and wounded up being a prisoner to the Glitchers.  Never did find out why but she wasn't the first person I've heard of ending up in a cell with those tech crazy freaks. \n\nOrchard's a good mom so she does what any decent parent does, she digs.  She gets the info she needed but it ended up being costly--200 credits if I recall right and to get all of them required a lot of work, most of it pretty damn sloppy truth be told.\n\nShe started the job with a wrench and a three charged swapper--given the lack of lethal weapons, she probably preferred to get around folk than kill them so she did that to the best she could.  She got shot at least five times in those early days but she did amass the credits and a lot of expensive and well-to-do gear--the sort of stuff that would get you shot five more times over if the wrong sort of person learned you had any of it.\n\nWell, after enough close calls she finally finds the ship where her baby girl is being kept.  She breaks in and wouldn't you know it? Every damn guard on that ship is carrying a personal shield that blocks even her graviton hammer from whisking them to la la land. Does she have anything to bring down those shield? Yeah she does but it only has three charges and there's at least twenty or so of those sheltered bastards.  \n\nSo, what does a mom do? She abuses what she found--it was a five charge slipstream, lets you move faster then a man could blink an eye, all she appeared to these folks was an odd blur moving from room to room, stopping to malfunction a door that was in her way until finally, she's carrying her daughter over her shoulder--exhausted but relieved to finally have her baby back, flesh and blood whole at that.\n\nCharge on the slipstream is gone.  Her swapper? One person at a time--she's not leaving without what she's come so far to get.  There is one little idea but its risky--the room, the one and only way into the cell where she's at has a panel that when damaged will take away a whole section of the ship.  \n\nShe had found a grenade in her second mission--kept it for a special ocassion.  It wasn't going to get more special than this. \n\nShe throws it, waits for the shake and the blaring sound of alarms echoing in the place along with a warning that they were heading to a station some fifteen seconds away.  There's no turning back here...\n\nHer and her daughter go jetting through the black, nothing but a fast ship and a prayer standing between the two of them and a cold death.\n\nWhen she arrives on the station she takes her daughter and vanishes.  She didn't want this kind of life and now that she got what she wanted she could leave it behind--her graviton hammer was left behind though, folks have gotten around to calling it \"Orchard's Lullaby\" in honor of one crazy, truly caring mom. \n\nIf you happen upon it...well, who knows? Maybe something of Orchard will get passed along with it.  A person in this line of work could always use a little hope and a lot of luck.", "timestamp_created": 1506421355, "timestamp_updated": 1506581925, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0,

But she was ill-prepared. Six attempts at getting to the bastard, six times flying bleeding out the airlock. This time she persisted. And this time she was trapped with no way to escape on the fleeing craft as it docked in enemy territory.\n\n***\n\nOrion had followed the trail of rumors about his partner to a shady backroom filled with rebels and thugs. A hunch materialized as an offer, secrets for sale if he would just do a few favors for the underground. For Vega, for the only woman who cared about him, he would have to become a force of nature. He would have to become a legend.\n\nThey were bouncing Vega from outpost to outpost, shuffling her around just ahead of him. But finally he was ready. A knife to the back, the hiss of the sidewinder glitching him down empty hallways to ready ambush points. He popped the switch on his visitor and stepped through space to where Vega was curled in the fetal position. Two seconds -- long enough for her to turn her head and see him, long enough for him to grab hold of her before he was whiplashed back into a hallway just as the guards raised their guns. And just as quickly he was gone.\n\n***\n\n\"Maybe you should give it up,\" Orion said. The rifle he'd picked off a Foundry elite was hung up on the wall like a trophy, barrel cold.\n\n\"Would you have given up?\" Vega asked.\n\n\"What I did... that was a debt. But this... this whole thing... most of the scars that would have healed have healed. There's nothing else for it. Just forget him. He's just one man.\"\n\nVega checked her loadout. \"Aren't we all?\"\n\n***\n\nVega rammed the Angel right up to the airlock loud enough to shake the ship. She flew out through the opening seal andpinned a guard through the back with her longblade. As the sentry gun teed her up from down the hall, she ducked back out of sight. A spatial hop with the sidewinder put her right behind the sentry gun and with a spark of electricity she tore out its heart.\n\nShe stepped through the opening door behind her, ready to bludgeon and slash her way to the monster at the other side of the ship -- just as missiles from a rogue fighter craft tore through the hull and sucked several bodies out into space. The alarm sounded and the memories of her captivity rushed through her head. \"I'm sorry,\" she muttered, thinking about the debt she would never be able to repay. About the monster that would always be just out of reach. She dove back into the Angel and detached from the ship as whirlwinds of fire were sucked through the tears in its hull.\n\nAnd there, faintly through the port viewscreen she saw him. Limbs flailing, hands grabbing at his throat as rapid decompression hurtled him through space. The man who broke Orion. Vega pulled the angel up just close enough to stare into the torturer's eyes as the life faded from them. If she couldn't have revenge, she would at least have closure.\n\n***\n\nYeah, crap like this happens all the time, 10/10.", "timestamp_created": 1506384898, "timestamp_updated": 1506385300, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498442", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35212841": {"recommendationid": "35212841", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041816028", "num_games_owned": 681, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 740, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511568119}, "language": "german", "review": "Do you like FTL?

Or rather, controlling chaos.  If you love planning things out and then watching those plans fall all apart in wonderfully unpredictable and oftentimes ridiculous ways, Heat Signature is the game for you.  It's also one of the few games out there with non-terminal failure states.  That is to say, failing isn't necessarily the end.  Getting shot doesn't necessarily result in death, you will have a short period of time to remote-control your ship and rescue yourself each time, but each time it happens the amount of time you will have next time is shorter, and eventually your character will die.  However, as a true roguelite game, you can just come back with another character and continue.  \n\nAnd there are more fates than death for your characters.  For instance, they could also be captured by the enemy, at which point you can rescue yourself with another character.  Essentially, you aren't really playing a single character, instead you are controlling an entire organization whose goal is to eventually liberate an entire galaxy.  However, each individual character you control has thier own personal goal that drives them.\n\nI first played this game back in beta and it really has come a long way.  I think the strongest part of the gameplay lies in the gadgets and equipment you can use on missions.  You can buy these things in the home station, or find them in missions.  Their various uses and unpredictability of the situations you will have to use them in make the game interesting and continue to provide you with challenges as you progress through the game.  \n\nMissions are the main way to progress, though there's nothing stopping you from going out and exploring the sector on your own.  Ships can be found flying between stations, doing their own thing, and you can board them looking for loot or capture them if you can take out all the guards and pilot it back to your home base.\n\nAltogether, this is a fun game with a simple but effective concept and mechanics that are easy to learn.  So far it seems like there are enough challenges at higher difficulties to keep the game interesting for a while, but I'm not far enough along yet to say for sure.

The gameplay itself is kind of stealth/action oriented depending on personal preferences and the overall loop has you going to a mission, winning or losing, and then repeating the process with some other ship/mission.\n\nBad - Extreme difficulty. Any difficulty past hard may as well not exist, I was able to beat maybe 1 in 20 tries on the higher diffuclty missions. So i just stopped trying them. I was ok with picking medium/hard, but eventually the game shoe-horns you into ONLY being able to pick these extremly high difficulty (including your primary character goal) missions, so it becomes frustrating as you get stuck trying to progress and simply cant. \n\nThe big issue is the guards with shields. They absolutely roadblock the entire game. You can bring a shield destroyer with you but it doesnt matter, because while you might be able to shut down 3-6 shields, the level will have around 20+ and so you just look around in disbelief as to what you are supposed to do. Some missions are quite literally impossible. \n\nOverall i do like the game. When it comes together and the challenge is just right, it's very satisfying and enjoyable.

This game is very satisfying in that; clearing a ship can be both an extreme challenge and a dawdle depending on your preference, how you prepare, your skill and your reaction time. Something i've noticed in my 2 hours is (as with Gunpoint) Heat Signature is very polished in it's little details, for instance; every station has a different design, stations get named after characters who liberated them and you can do unexpected things such as rescuing a hostage by blowing up the room next to them so they shoot off into space.\n\nGripes:\nThis game NEEDS customization of pretty much everything and much better story/lore, other than developer budget i see no reason why not. Customization options should include: Name, Gender, Ethnicity and Clothes/Armour (I'll get back to this). In terms of story/lore i feel Heat Signature does well during the tutorial phase and then begins to fizzle out. im interested to learn about the four factions and The Drift as a whole, i want missions to have briefs just to give me some motivation as i murder countless members of X faction to steal Y project. My final gripe is that while the weapons in Heat Signature seem fleshed out there are no armor options or upgrades at all which I found odd, Armour could have been an interesting mechanic; say having heavy armour being highly protective but loud so that enemies in adjacent rooms can hear you.

Incredibly unique in all the ways that count nowadays, simple design with huge potential and a ton of love put into it. Oozes that 'open' spirit missing from developement post big money gaming, keeps the spirit alive. Charming art design, simple sound that delivers and doesn't try too hard. Music is cute and beepy boopy but gets you in that space operator feel. The creativity possible with the game elements at its base is extremely wide open and situational; I don't think there is another game of it's kind that does everything this does so tactfully without a single hint of ugly DLC moneygrabbing or content choking, my hat is firmly off. \n\nThe combat mechanics are clean and simple, delivering a very uncluttered experience. The pause menu system is useful and spartan like I feel they should be. No consolization Y-wheel bologna, opens alot of possibilities and creates a puzzle system feel. The space piloting element of the pod feels just like how you think space would be in 2D like those old flash games that turned into infinite space etc- clunky but not for the sake of bad controls. \n\nDocking in motion is fun at its base and when shit gets hectic you invoke the COME ON TARS in yourself and dock with that floating chunk of wreckage holding your rescue target (bless you warzone rescues with tight limits). The pods are all quite different and I gotta say, the Brick is a hoot to just smash shit with boy howdy. Window diving and catching yourself with your pod always feels just so godamn fun, the vacuum element is sweet.

You enter covertly and proceed to fulfill your contracted objective, be it assassination, stealing equipment or rescuing individuals. You get in and get out, and in most cases you leave the target ship and all its crew dead in doing so, floating out into the abyss. Contracts are rated by difficulty, and are very quickly played through. You dont rank your character with XP, instead you become more capable through the loot gained on previous missions, or loot purchased within a freindly space station. The Harder the contract the more pay. To make things more interesting each character has a back story, with a long term personal objective, such as carrying out a Revenge Killing, and the information you need to get closer to achieving this long term goal is expensive, and you start of practicaly broke ...so this adds to the flavour of the game by giving your character purpose throughout your play through. In my total time of 2.5hrs I have gone through 4 characters and have lost them all!   :(    If your character is captured you can even find his old partner as a playable character, who's long term goal is to rescue his incarcerated capadre, and by doing so lets you pick up where you left off! You can retire characters, I guess you do so anytime after they have achieved their personal goal, and in doing so you are making them a historical legend, to be compared with others (high score?)\n.\nThis game is great!

Unique and engaging blend of game concepts (but still focused on clear ideas), with a high level of polish hinting at a lot of developer passion. First \"roguelike\" that really clicked for me - the core mechanics and player freedom are balanced just right to create memorable experiences and unexpected twists without relying on a scripted story. Intense but not stressful, thanks to the ability to pause anytime to plan the next move; almost gives it a turn-based feel. Can be played on easier missions for a while, but for some of the later progress you have to go through at least a few harder missions. I hit a wall early on, but luckily didn't give up until my skill finally improved. There are many items/gadgets that can help, but over time I've also started enjoying playing with minimal items (e.g. whatever comes with a fresh character) for an even more focused experience. It can absolutely be possible to pick the hardest available mission with a completely fresh character with no fancy items, and still beat it because there are so many ways to achieve your goal - immense satisfaction. Even though there's no real story, the game's mini-universe actually feels pretty immersive - there are no transitions between screens, it's all seamlessly mousewheel-zoomable from a close-up of your character all the way to a map of the entire universe. Music is great and adds to immersion as well.

It's super fun and being able to get a little creative with accomplishing missions is also great (Like, in an assassination mission, boarding the ship, killing everyone, then killing off everyone except for the target. Get in a duel with Target, but shoot out a window and then reboard the ship and bring it back to a station to sell its loot.)\n\nThe only gripe that I have is that once you get attached to a character, there is an insane difficulty spike. What I mean is, when trying to select a new mission, every mission will be either labeled as Hard or higher. In my experience, it doesn't even matter which station you go to, because no mission will be easier than Hard. When you get to this point, you are basically being set up to fail, and the character you enjoyed playing as will either get captured or die.\nPersonally, I prefer to play through Medium level missions, because I like to play at my own pace.\nThere isn't a reason to do this to the players, since each difficulty yields payment that scales with the difficulty. Someone farming easy or medium missions won't make as much as they would on higher difficulties, and even if they are making more, that cash could be used to get better equipment for harder missions.\n\nIf the devs would implement the choice for players to play the difficulty level they want to play, this game will be one of my favorite games here on Steam by far.

I didn't play so many of those characters that I could see if they were repetitious or not, but ultimately the mission they send you on to complete your story line is one of the 3 kinds available. Those 4 were assassinate, capture, steal or hijack.

The small amount of weapons, enemies and mission types quickly make the game boring. I enjoyed the simple graphics, they felt right at home with the gameplay.

Sagitta left behind his favorite slipstream. It was a rechargable high-capacity model that proved invaluable on nearly every mission. New to the space pirate career, we have the young and ambitious Catch Vision. Her father told her stories about the legenday Sagitta, and Catch (thinking it would make him proud) dedicated herself to becoming the next great assassin. She filled out countless contracts, killed without mercy, and was about to finished her personal contract when the ship she had boarded flew into a Sovereign spaceport. Captured. She feared it was over. Who would rescue her - a murderer? For days - weeks - she was alone on Sovereign transport ships. On one mostly normal day, Catch heard the familiar sound of a teleporter, something she has used many times herself. \"It could be a glitcher raid,\" she thought of the different possibilities, \"or a space pirate, or-.\" Something that had not crossed her mind was her own father, Carbon Vision, in his old age, single-handedly clearing out an entire Sovereign ship to save her. \"But how?\" she asked, \"How did you know how to find me?\"\n\n     \"It's not my first time in space, dear.\" He grinned, \"plus, my old friend Sagitta gave me a hand.\" He holds up Journey Sagitta's Slipstream and tosses it to her. \"Now let's get out of here.\" \n\n     Back at home on one of the spaceports, Catch shows her father the Orion device. \"I don't know what this does, but I knows what it's worth: enough for both of us to live safely.\" Catch and Carbon enter retirement and become legends of their own. Carbon passes down his finely crafted Self-Charging extreme-range swapper, and Catch, her rechargable extreme-range sidewinder. Together, they liberated 8 spaceports (including the Sovereign stronghold) and killed ~200 Sovereign.\n\n\nTL;DR - Father rescues daughter, killed a lot of Sovereign, became legends.", "timestamp_created": 1506303947, "timestamp_updated": 1506303947, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35194158": {"recommendationid": "35194158", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120547975", "num_games_owned": 233, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 282, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511044986}, "language": "english", "review": "A game made by the same guys who made Gunpoint but, instead of flinging yourself out of windows and dying, you throw wrenches at yourself and... die...\n\nIn all seriousness, this is a spectacular game that has everything I wanted in a space stealh-action game.

It can feel a bit repetitive at the outset, then as you start to understand how to best customize kits you can really get into it. At a certian point your team has so many resources that it starts to feel repetitive again, and that's probably between the 10-20 hour mark depending on how quickly you push through it.\n\nIn the game, you have a team of characters. Each character starts out new, with basically nothing, and must be upgraded with new and better equipment, earned through missions. The more missions  you do, the more equipment and notoriety you earn. If you don't do something stupid and get your character killed or captured, there are personal missions. With high noteriety, you start to see diminishing returns on mission rewards, which does a good job of pushing you to complete your personal mission. Once the personal mission is complete, your character retires and a newbie takes his/her place. If, as previously mentioned, your character is killed or captured, one of his/her family members will often take his/her place. Their personal missions are to avenge or rescue (allowing you to play as that character again) the character you got killed or captured.\n\nThere is plenty of replayability, if you enjoy the format. You can even start a completely new galaxy if you want to begin from scratch.\n\nMy biggest gripe is that there seem to be plenty of missed oppertunities with mission variance. There are essentially 5 missions: Steal, Rescue, Capture, Hijack, and Assassinate. Each mission follows the same pattern: fly to ship, board, take something, go back home. For a game with so much procedural content, it would be nice to have seen procedural missions, as well. Multi-stage missions, involving multiple ships, could virtually eliminate much of the feeling of repetition. How about a mission where you steal explosives from one ship, use them to destroy another ship, then plant evidence of the crime on a third ship? Or perhaps you rescue a sick man from one ship, smuggle him through enemy territory on a second ship, capture an enemy doctor on a third ship and bring him back to ship #2, take a cure off a 4th medical transport ship, then deliver everyone to a 5th hospital ship? There are limitless possibilities with the current mission variants; if a few more variants were added in addition to multi-stage missions, that feeling of repetition might go away.\n\nIn spite of the flaws, I really love this game. I hope Suspicious Developments continues with it and expands upon its already fantastic foundation.

Thought it would be fairly boring, since the way it looks is sorta plain. Ended up being pretty neat.\n\nIt's a roguelite where you gotta do missions in order to make money to get a 'personal mission'. Don't know what those are yet. The game controls really well and its got all kinds of quality of life keybinds to make the bad parts better. You fly to a ship, then inside the ship you kill or knock everyone out. Then you can capture them, their ship, or an item on their ship. If you capture their ship, you get money and a random resource.  Seems like there's random ships flying around you can board too, but make sure that you don't get stuck in their lights because they'll shoot you.\n\nYou can die but its fairly forgiving the first time you die. Then it makes the respawn process harder to do the second time and by the third time you're basically dead for good. What happens is that they knock you out, put you out into space and make you remote control your own ship to pick up your body. If you don't get picked up in time you die. If you don't return to the boarded ship fast enough, it flies away. If your pod gets damaged and you don't return to motherbase fast enough you die. Every time you run into that scenario the timer is shorter. \n\nPretty cool, I hope it can keep up the variety after a few hours because that's the fun of it.", "timestamp_created": 1506280201, "timestamp_updated": 1506280201, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35188569": {"recommendationid": "35188569", "author": {"steamid": "76561198091893972", "num_games_owned": 84, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 366, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506796949}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is absolutely amazing.\n\nThere's 400 other reviews telling you WHY this game is so amazing, so im going to tell you HOW amazing it is.\n\nAlright so imagine hotline miami... pretty amazing game right?\n\nNow what if we add high tech shit and enemies, gadgets that teleport you around and disable the enemies' high tech shit?

For the two second summary, I would describe it as what would happen if you took the controls and combat from Hotline Miami, and the systems and tools from Dishonored, and combined them into one game.\n\nAt first I was concerned with the repetitive game structure. For the most part, you just take and do missions, over and over. But, as I hit harder and harder missions, I found that I was forced to do more and more insane and creative things to get through missions.\n\nIn one mission, my capture target had armor that was impenetrable to every weapon I had. But, my mission was to extract him without killing him. So, I shot out a nearby window, sucking everything in the room into space. Much to my surpise, he had moved just out of reach of the room, and didn't get sucked out. So, I turned on a temporary invincible shield, took out a concussive hammer, and hit him over and over towards the window until we both got sucked out into space. Then, I remote piloted my pod and snatched us both from space before we ran out of oxygen. Mission complete!\n\nIn another, there was no timer or alarm timer, but I accidently blew up a room with a guard with a key I needed, completely locking me out from later parts of the mission. No problem! I found another smaller ship, hijacked it, flew it over to the ship I needed to infiltrate, shot a missile at the side of the ship I wanted to enter. This blasted a small hole right where I needed in.

There is permadeath, though it's not at all unavoidable. In fact, only one character has died so far, and it was only because he got shot so many times he could no longer take any more shots and go into incapacitation instead of just dying. Your characters can get captured and you can resuce them with another character; or you can reach a point where your current character can no longer truly benefit to progressing through the overall goal of liberating the entire procedurally-generated astroid belt-thing, at which point you can retire the character and name a weapon or otherwise piece of equipment they have in the off-chance it turns up again in future playthroughs with another character, or maybe in one of your steam friends' games. I named an armour-piercing sword the \"Chastity Penetrator\", by the way.\n\nBack to strategy though, there is a lot of ways to deal with any given situation without needing specialized equipment. Need to knock out a guy wearing armor but don't have any weapons that can penetrate armor without also killing the target? Wait for him to walk past a window, shoot it out to catapult the guy into space and pick him up in your little space pod. Need to deal with a little cluster of guards but don't want to alert anyone? Grab a bunch of wrenches lying around the place, teleport in there, and pause to switch wrenches everytime you swing one and it goes into cooldown. The \"pause, plan and play\" style you develop as you get a feel for how to do things is somewhat similar to Doorkickers, another good game, but its more open with a ton of more choices of equipment. Or you could, you know, load up on a bunch of guns and Slipstreams - which are basically steroids without the downsides - and Rambo your way through the entire ship. It's a valid strategy if the alarm is already sounded and you need to finish your objective pronto.\n\nAnd in terms of the equipment, it's quite similar to Borderlands. There are a variety of traits and equipment types, and the stuff you find are randomly created from those possible choices. I found an automatic silenced pistol that regenerated ammo over time once, and it was glorious. \n\nAlso, again, you dont neccesarily need specialized equipment to deal with a given situation. You COULD wait next to a terminal and whack the guards one by one as they come to do...stuff...on it. But there could be a time limit and you need to deal with them fast. Also that's boring. So instead you teleport into the room and throw wrenches at everyone because you don't need the alarm to trigger and you dont have any silenced weapons. Moments where things go wrong are when this game shines the brightest, as long as you don't mess up getting yourself out. You can theorhetically deal with any difficulty with the starter gear, even if that entails bugging out by throwing a sword at a window to vent yourself to space once you inevitably get spotted and picking yourself up with your pod by controling it remotely.", "timestamp_created": 1506254387, "timestamp_updated": 1506254950, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35178709": {"recommendationid": "35178709", "author": {"steamid": "76561198159554681", "num_games_owned": 246, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 1321, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509566811}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a good game.\nIt's like oceans 11, but it's a game, and in space, and you're alone, and you're not robbing casinos.\nBut apart from that, it's exactly like that.", "timestamp_created": 1506253804, "timestamp_updated": 1506253804, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35178708": {"recommendationid": "35178708", "author": {"steamid": "76561198258709123", "num_games_owned": 39, "num_reviews": 80, "playtime_forever": 1039, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 137, "last_played": 1513958451}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]Space-line Miami[/h1]\n\nin the greatest essence, Heat SIgnature is a top down, 1 hit space adventure game, where the player picks a character and completes missions and/or hijacks faction ships and sells the items inside for currency.\n\n[b] Its effectively a wierd, less serious roleplaying hotline Miami in space with the option to give EPIC BLUNT FORCE TRAUMA  to anyone if you don't feel like slicing their nuts off with a space katana[/b]\n\nIts like gunpoint too.

you get given a fixed starting kit and an objective on a ship and have to work it out from there.  It's both an interesting challenge, and a great way to learn the different tools.\n\nAs the sales blurb says, it's also a game about trying to get out of your mistakes.  Just had a great mission where I was a bit gung ho and set off an alarm, with over half the ship to still traverse to my goal.  With the seconds counting down until the ship docked and I was to be captured I evaluated my options.  I could try to head for the pilot to kill him, stop the countdown, then sweep the ship clean at my leisure, but that was risky with large clusters of guards in between me and him.  I wasn't convinced I could do it in time.  Instead I started making a beeline for my assassination target.  First hurdle: a turret directly in my path.  Whipping out my crashbeam, I shut down the turret, legged it across a tunnel opening before a patrolling guard could see me, and rounded the corner straight into a locked door.  With no key weilding guards in sight, I thought all was lost, until I spotted another patrolling guard on the other side of the door.  He was just in range of my swapper teleporter, so soon enough I was through the door, with a puzzled guard standing where I had been moments before.  With 10s on the clock I rounded the corner into a large room and lunged at the nearest guard, slicing him open before throwing my longblade at his nearby friend.  I then sprinted at my target, picking up my longblade en route, and ended him.  At this point I had 4s on the clock, and my escape pod was all the way at the other end of the ship.  I thought it was game over, until I realised I was near the hull.  Pausing and looking around I spied a nearby window and headed towards it.  With no guns available to me, and 1s left on the clock, I hurled my longblade at the window, shattering it and yanking me out into space.  Quickly taking remote control of my pod, I flew it around to pick me up and headed home, heart racing.

Heat Signature is as Scott says in his own words \"[A game] where you break into spaceships, make terrible mistakes, and think of clever ways out of them.\" Honestly, I think that's the best way to put it.\n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1]\nHeat Signature's gameplay boils down to what Scott says plus a little more - You break into a spaceship one way or another, probably screw it up somehow and then try to become a magician in an escape act. The things Scott [i] doesn't [/i] tell you in this summary of the game is though; is how you'll be spending 1/3rd of your time flying to and from your faction's (which you for what I can tell - cannot choose which for some may not be ideal) base, getting missions and then spamming \"F\" to speed up the downtime between choosing a mission and doing the mission.\n\nNow for the missions themselves? They're fine. It's usually just a \"steal this\" or \"kill this person\" but there's certain ways you can do it which make them fun. For instance, I had to kill a person who (along with everyone else in the massive ship) had armor. Now you can't shoot through or really damage armor with anything that isnt explosives or an expensive gun with rare ammo. So I thought to myself \"well It doesn't matter if I kill everyone else, because this mission isn't bloodless or anything.\" And then lightning strikes - what if I hijack a different ship, and use the missles to blow up the ship with my target in it? \n\nIt worked. And that's only the simpliest way I could think of to do the mission without killing myself. Now you might be asking though - \"Why do you do the missions?\" Well I'm getting there you slow, slow, child; you get to liberate more stations for your faction, now these stations could either just be nothing but another blip on the map to make you feel good about yourself, or they might actually be useful, for example some stations will allow you to buy that certain faction's pod, some pods can destroy ships by ramming themselves into it at the cost of health, and others can go into stealth. There is also the fact that to completely \"destroy\" a faction, you must liberate that faction's stronghold, which requires you personally, to go in and fly the ship into the stronghold, and destroy it (although you could put it on autopilot and run, where's the fun in that?)\n\n[h1] Atmosphere [/h1]\nHeat Signature's atmosphere is what you would expect for a space game, it'd big,vast, and mostly empty. but once you scroll back a bit and see the giant gas clouds that cover the solar system sized war that your milita is currently fighting for, you just sit there for a moment, and realize how beautiful it is; or atleast I did.\n\n[h1] Writing & Story [/h1]\nHeat Signature is a rouge-lite, as in there is not much story outside of generic \"I want to [Kill,Capture,Steal] the [Randomly Generated Name for Valuable item,Man,Woman,Officer,Liutennant] [Who,So I can] [Killed,Tortured,Pay off my debt] My [Relative/Loved one.]\" As for the writing of the game? If you played Gunpoint, the dialouge is a bit more toned down, but still there, and still obviously Scott's humor.\n\n[h1] Conclusion / TL;DR [/h1]\nHeat Signature is a fun,funny,gameplay focused,beautiful indie game by the developer of Gunpoint which (as of writing this) is on sale - so why not buy it now?", "timestamp_created": 1506237491, "timestamp_updated": 1506237556, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515390", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35172751": {"recommendationid": "35172751", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011496682", "num_games_owned": 120, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 90, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506233462}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\ub2e8\uc21c\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc7ac\ubc0c\ub294, \uc544\uc8fc \uc88b\uc740\uac8c\uc784.", "timestamp_created": 1506235846, "timestamp_updated": 1506235846, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35171804": {"recommendationid": "35171804", "author": {"steamid": "76561198097418723", "num_games_owned": 371, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 504, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507354873}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty much FTL + HOTLINE MIAMI \n\nAnd that is not an bad thing very fun and easy to get lost with.

The best moments for me are when things go pear-shaped and create an unexpected opportunity.  One event I'm thinking of is when I was breaking into a ship that had just a few too many keylocks than I had ability to steal keys based on my current build.  I snuck in an attack on a keyholder, but I used the wrong weapon (oops) and ended up tossing a grenade instead.  It knocked them out, but also alerted most of the ship.  Alert started, and I had 22 seconds to make it out (mission complete or not) OR get to the pilot and take them out.  Pilot was out of the question, and the pod was a very far run away.  No windows to jump out of...\n\nThen I noticed the security guards were chasing to the point of my explosion, and there was a brief moment when the high security doors were open thanks to all the guards.  I had 2 high capacity sidewinders, so with the doors open I teleported at record speed through the ship, stole my objective, then made it back out to a window on the far side of the ship before anyone went far enough to let a single door shut.  Iw as out of the ship in seconds, completing a mission I thought I'd surely failed.\n\nThat's what makes the game the most fun.

So I was trying to break into a ship, and send it crashing into a stronghold. I ended up triggering a few enemies and getting thrown out a couple of times, but it was no issue as I had a ship that negated the effects of getting thrown out. So I was supposed to get the pilot and change the course of the ship, but because I was thrown out right after I knocked out the pilot, all the guards were hanging out at the bridge, waiting for someone. I waited a while but was unsure what to do. Then, I had a brilliant idea! I would lead the guards away then teleport into the bridge! So I led the guards to another room, then proceeded to teleport to the bridge... but some guards saw me and called the alarm. I had just enough time to change the course. I was thrown out, but as the a counter appeared over the ship, I was certain that I lost the mission. However, the dumb guards didn't know how to pilot a ship, and my mission was accomplished.

You do this to further the rebellion against all the factions in the 'galaxy' (the game's region of space).\n\nAfter \"docking\" uninvited on an enemy ship, you will [strike]murder everything[/strike] disable it by [strike]exploding everything[/strike] cautiously knocking out the ship's crew - non-lethally, [b]of course[/b].\nThe game allows (and encourages) you to press SPACE for a quick, tactical pause, that allows you to switch gear and do crazy amounts of cool moves. Like hacking a turret, disabling enemies' shields, teleporting/switching places with an enemy, murdering the pilot and blowing up a hole that sucks a squad of unsuspecting crew members out into space in a few seconds.\n\nHaving randomly generated characters with personal missions is also very neat. If you're a roleplayer (as in, you set rules, morals and/or goals for characters) you can create pretty cool stories.\nIf you're not into that, by losing a character you'll only lose its gear, which is pretty light when compared to roguelites/roguelikes by which you lose all of it's skills, experience and unlockables. Losing is Fun.\n\nMind that if you're not into roguelites, the lack of an overarching story and the expected repetitive nature of the game might get to you.\nThat said, the only thing I'd wish to have more of, is equipment/customization for your pod. Sensors, EMP, hacking capabilities, would make it a much more lively part of the game.\n\nIn conclusion, Heat Signature is an amazing surprise. I've only heard about it yesterday, saw 3 minutes of video and that's all it took to guarantee my purchase. \nIt is by no means a perfect game - much could be further improved or added. But for its price, even if you're not familiar with the related games, it's worth checking out.\n\nThanks for reading!\n\n-\nEdited September 26, 2017: For clarity, I previously said the game could be further polished. I've edited that out as I bumped into no issues with the game, as what is there is definitely a solid, polished experience.

As I'm sure you know, this game is about sneaking aboard ships and either assassinating a target, rescuing somebody, hijacking the ship, or capturing somebody.\n\nA lot of the game revolves around planning how you will tackle the ship once you are aboard. You will (and are encouraged to) pause the game often to set up a combo such as:\n-teleport into a group of enemies\n-pause\n-slash the closest enemy\n-pause\n-shoot the furthest enemy\n-pause\n-swap guns while paused to reset shot cooldown\n-shoot the last enemy\n\nThis game also is heavy in mission clauses such as nobody can be killed, no witnesses left alive, etc, etc.\n\nYou are knocked out from any damage you take, and guards will take you to the nearest airlock and throw you into space, where you will need to remote control your pod to come save you. Don't fret however, as you can fly back and keep at it. \n\n---HOWEVER---\n\nIf you are shot/slashed/blown up too many times, the character will die and you will need to start a new character, or use another one you have been working on in the same galaxy, so the only thing lost is the gear that character had acquired (which is very easy to get the best gear you'll need).\n\nThe most fun you'll have though is when your plan goes to shit, which it will, and you need to come up with another insane plan to get your ass out of trouble, which may include shooting a window and spacing yourself just to get back into your pod and circle around to the ship again.\n\nThe last and neatest thing in my opinion is that when you eliminate all enemies aboard a ship, you can fly it and use it temporarily to attack other ships. When a ship is undamaged, you can only board at it's one or two airlocks, however you can dock at any  broken piece of ship as well once it is damaged, creating new routes to your target.\n\nSolid 8/10 at this point", "timestamp_created": 1506202943, "timestamp_updated": 1506202943, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35164591": {"recommendationid": "35164591", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037696332", "num_games_owned": 231, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 396, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508188189}, "language": "english", "review": "Game is very good at making you feel like a skilled operative.

After gearing up he stepped aboard that ship, sneaked/hacked/shot his way through the ship to the room where his mother was kept in.

A perfect mixture of action-oriented and fast-paced combat, combined with the strategy, planning and tactics necessary to actually come back from your daring heists in one piece.\n\nDuring the game you will play many diffrent charackters, all of them motivated by a personal goal, some of them linked to other charackters. I will never forget how my favorite guy was caught by the authorities because of a monumental mistake on my part. At this point his sister walked into the bar, resolved to get him back. After a few noteworthy adventures on her own she finally got the intel, money and equipment to get her brother back. She makes her way through the enemy ship, one of the harder missions I have played so far and yet she almost made it to his prison cell, if it were not for an uncooperative prison guard who decides to sound the alarm at which point all hell breaks loose. Only 30 seconds to grab my brother and get back to my ship or I will loose them both forever...\n\nThis sort of thing is priceless to me and it is this part of the game that I didn't quite expect grabing me like it did. Sure the scenario and the mechanics looked interesting to me at first, but not every game manages to motivate you like this one does.

Some bad-a$$ boss has a shield but you're out of armor piercing rounds? No problem! Lure him close by a window, break it out, and watch our armored acquaintance get sucked into the void of space!

Someone else said in their review that it was like FTL meets Transistor meets Hotline Miami, at which point I yelled \"Sold!\" and bought it before finishing reading their review, having greatly enjoyed Gunpoint by the same developer.\n\nThe stuff you go through in this game will make you want to tell your friends about it. I instantly took to the game and convinced a friend it was worth it, and we've been swapping stories about the crazy stuff that we've done or had done to us since. Killing 4 dudes with a shotgun but accidentally blowing out a window and spacing yourself, only to rescue yourself with your remote controlled lifepod, returning to the ship, getting knocked out and captured? This isn't an unusual story in this game.\n\nThe game loop is essentially a soft-stealth game, where the consequences of being spotted are open ended. I've been knocked out by a guard who dragged me towards the airlock but walked over my glitch-trap and spaced himself before he got there, leaving me to recover consciousness and complete my mission, for example.\n\nThe connecting material of the game is a large-scale open ended campaign where you convert the space stations of powerful factions to join your Independent faction by completing mercenary missions. You can also just fly around looking for ships to hijack and see if they have any decent loot.\n\nThe main meta progression comes from having additional items added to your stores' inventory by converting space stations. You will lose many of your characters, and retire a few, but it doesn't take long to get a brand new fresh-faced space explorer up to the point of being able to attempt very hard missions, often with a totally different playstyle to your previous, depending on what kinds of items you end up finding. A dude with a high-capacity stealth-shield and armour-piercing longblade is going to use a different approach to a dude with an automatic shotgun and personal defense shield.\n\nI don't know how much longevity the game will ultimately prove to have. At 10 hours I'm definitely satisfied with my purchase already and intend to complete the campaign at least once; I'm nearly 1/4 through.

Once you understand the rules of the game there is nothing you can't do. There are so many fun tools and weapons to use, it controls well, and it is just a lot of fun.\n\nGetting into trouble is the real draw of the game, because getting into trouble means you have to get out of it. So far I have always been able to at least know of the way to handle a situation, though I may not have always been succseful. The ship generation is wonderful and I have so far never felt that a ship generated to be unfair. \n\nPretty much every ship I enter, I leave having enjoyed myself. I found myself fixated to the game in only my first hour of play. Even times when I died did not make me feel bad (and dieing is pretty rough in this game). I just wanted to keep going and going. \n\nThere are some drawbacks. The game gives you everything at the start. Even though there is a light progression system, that only applies to what can be bought in shops. As far as I am aware all major items in the game can be found as loot somewhere at the very start. This is a drawback because a new player will quickly use pretty much evey general type of item very early on. If that player can not figure out other ways of having fun, such as forcing themselves to be creative or use items based on their character's story (Ex. A character that refuses to use lethal weapons), may quickly burn themselves out, but if they what I just said, then they can just keep going and going.\n\nAll in all: You should play this game.", "timestamp_created": 1506164883, "timestamp_updated": 1506164883, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35147111": {"recommendationid": "35147111", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030857658", "num_games_owned": 505, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1832, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509087069}, "language": "english", "review": "I hate this game. I really wanted to like it, but it's just incredibly frustrating, and boring. I seriously regret not refunding before the 2hr mark, and now I'm stuck with it. My advice to you is, if you're not feeling it at the two-hour mark, then just refund your money and walk away. \n\nYou'll probably be doing them a favour anyway, because then you won't leave a mean, nasty review on their store page, like I did.\n\nThe game comprises two main parts: A mini-game where you clumsily and awkwardly navigate your ship towards your mission. I realise the point of this bit is to be a little \"tricky\" and \"fiddly,\" but I just find it incredibly frustrating and not fun at all. If you found the controls in Long Journey Home depressingly and frustratingly annoying, then you'll know how this feels.\n\nThis section of the game adds nothing to the overall gameplay and leaves me completely frustrated and annoyed before even starting a mission proper. It is a tedious chore every single time. It's like the game wants me to start every mission upset. \n\nAnd it feels like an insult, because then after that whole struggle, the missions themselves (at least in the first 3 hours I've played) are so mind-numbingly simple and boring that I can't believe the game made me do all that works for this. \n\nThe missions themselves could be described as a blend of Hotline Miami and Superhot, except that this would make it sound really exciting and compelling, and I don't want to mislead you. Regardless, if you've seen the trailer you understand how the gameplay proceeds in the main missions. \n\nMy frustration with how these levels play out is mainly two-fold. Firstly, although the graphic design is quite aesthetically pleasing, actually having to play through is not pleasing at all. Unless I'm zoomed right in, I find it quite hard to distinguish between my character, NPCS and the level. Everything is unnecessarily cluttered, and a nice clean design like FTL would have served the actual gameplay far better. Usually if I die its because I'm confused about what direction either I or an NPC is facing, etc. It's just not great design. (NB: I am playing at 1440p, so I can't say if these issues are improved at lower resolutions).\n\nSo, why not just play zoomed in the whole time? For one thing, it feels extremely claustrophic: It just feels bad. And also the game can't be played at that level of zoom, because the whole point is for you to be watching how the NPCs are moving about from room to room, so you need to be zoomed out. But then everything is just cluttered and confusing again. \n\nA feature that might have saved this is being able to move the camera independantly, i.e. so that I can scroll around by moving the mouse to the edge of the screen. Nope! I don't know why, but this is my biggest gripe about the game. I hate it more than anything. It's the final straw that makes me rage quit every time. I don't know what it is, but it just makes the game... wrong. It's feels like one of those pointless restrictions you find in games from time to time, where you wonder \"what were they thinking? Why on earth was such a simple feature as 'scrolling-with-the-mouse' not implemented?\" \n\nSo there you are. I'm not sure why this game has made me so mad. I've never written a Steam review before. I loved Gunpoint. And I don't feel great about leaving such a harsh review for a two-man studio's sophomore game. \n\nBut my jimmies are rustled, and they cannot be ignored.", "timestamp_created": 1506154377, "timestamp_updated": 1506154377, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.409179", "comment_count": "11", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35147049": {"recommendationid": "35147049", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055367155", "num_games_owned": 317, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1237, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506525499}, "language": "english", "review": "Honstely one of the most unique, challenging, great game of this year by far\n\n9/10", "timestamp_created": 1506154164, "timestamp_updated": 1506154164, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35146839": {"recommendationid": "35146839", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074553624", "num_games_owned": 412, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 215, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506183028}, "language": "english", "review": "good game", "timestamp_created": 1506153373, "timestamp_updated": 1506153373, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35146801": {"recommendationid": "35146801", "author": {"steamid": "76561197985688188", "num_games_owned": 72, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 18, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506153130}, "language": "english", "review": "Having to chase missions in circles for the privlige of doing them is a stupid design choice.

And for the first 3 or so hours, it is a really fun game and there seems like a lot to do. However, you quickly realize that this game is a grindfest, and all the missions and ships blend together where it feels like you're playing the same mission, over and over and over. Fly to mission, kill kill kill, use tool use tool kill. Instead of expanding on all this, I'm just going to list out things that really bring this game down.\n\nMost of all, is this hard-coded kit-counter system. Every enemy, once you get to the hard stages, has a kit, a number of equipment they have. Such as the dreaded shield or armor. These can only be countered by a specific item, of which you may not have. In the harder ships, like the personal missions, you'll have a group of 5 guards standing around, talking, not going on patrols where you can pick them off, you have to use a specific item or you pretty much have to game it. That doesn't feel very fun. Even less fun is you have to grind to find the items, you can't buy them in your shop right away. You have to search crates on other ships until you find it, or open loot crates. Not fun. There's not any sort of fluid way to get past them many times.\n\nSamey environments: Procedural generation claims another victim. Or I should say, a generator that can't crank out very different ships. After a while, everything seems the same. The placements of the pilot and the objective change, some ships are squat while others have long spindely arms, but your path tends to be the same, more on this later. It makes for realism I'm sure, but not interesting challenges.\n\nDeath a Slap on the Wrist: This is probably one of the next worst mistakes, but there is a way to virtually eliminate any consequences for failure, and it makes the game experience terrible, because you're left with chipping away at marble until you finish the mission. Buying the Offworld Angel, a pod you unlock pretty early in the game, and that only costs 20 credits, about one easy mission's payment, allows you to a. only have to get roughly close to your character before you can pick them up in space. B. and this is the big one, if you get shot, and spaced, and get back in your angel pod before death, you no longer have any lasting problems (which are just pretty much always the same, you lose some time to pick yourself up). Big problem, dealing with every near death making getting shot more and more risky makes failure always a risk to lose all your stuff, and having that not happen anymore really takes a lot of the excitement out of missions. But other games have this issue, and can get over it. System Shock 2 for example, does this a lot, and it works out, but in those you lose all your stuff where you died, and have to go back and get it and sometimes that's a challenge in its own. Not here, you basically can respawn adinfinitum at the airlock. The other thing you can do to eliminate failure is rush the pilot, if you rush the pilot, you don't even have to kill him or sometimes even knock him unconscious, if you just get him out of his chair, no more alerts no more timers, you have unlimited time to do the mission. Adds to the feeling of a grindfest.\n\nAlso present in the game, many bugs, annoying zoom issues, and impossible flying large ships\n\nHopefully you see the issues here. All solvable, but the issue is that this game needs more time in development. I know Tom has been working on this for like 4 years now, but it needs more work before its a good game.\n\nI will quickly talk about a mode the game does right. The defector missions, which you unlock as you grind your way through what I guess is a tech tree, are great. Exactly what the game should be. Handcrafted, interesting missions where you're given tools and told to solve the mission.

Immediate purchase.\n\nA lot of people are saying this is like if Hotline Miami were set in space, and to an extent, theyre right. You come into a level where you can see the enemies and the layout of the map, but the enemies cant see you, you go through and kill all the enemies, all dying in one shot. However, Heat Signature takes it a step above that. For starters, you don't die right away. One hit knocks you out, but then you get shot into space and are forced to catch yourself with your own spaceship flying at hundreds of miles an hour with the time ticking down and youre just a tiny little speck and oh dear god the panic. Secondly, you are at a slight advantage. You know the types of enemies you will fight, and you are allowed to bring whatever gear you think you will need into the fight. This being said, you are at a huge numbers disadvantage. There are 15 guards, 7 of them have shields, and you only have 3 charges on your shield dispelling gun. what now?\n\nThis scenario is where the game shines though. That \"what now\" moment is constant, and terrifying. You can try to get away, and just say screw it, ill come back when i have better gear. You can try to just stealth your way through, get your target and run. You can try to get a lucky drop in one of the ships cargo containers. Those are just the first few thoughts that go through your head.\n\n As far as Ive seen, the combinations of weapons and gadgets in this game are what will make it the most replayable. One character I played as a pure brute shooter. When that eventually failed, I played as her father, a time altering ninja who went on a daring quest to get his daughter back (this was not a headcannon, this was the actual personal story i got with this character). Then when he eventually met his icy death, i played as a teleporting renegade, looking to avenge his sisters death. I would place down a glitch mine, that teleports your enemies to whereever you select, then I would swap my position with the enemy, shooting them directly into space, and me through the door. This was all within the 3 hours ive played just today. \n\nIn summary: this game gives you a character with a history and a personal quest, and tells you to do whatever missions you want to do in order to reach your goal. Its fast paced, you feel like a badass, and i can already tell, there is a lot of potential for \"holy fucking shit, that actually worked???\" moments. People might be saying that i can get repetitive, but I disagree. The amount of variation in the enemies alone make the game feel new each time you accept a contract. Add in the huge amount of ship layouts, loadouts, playstyles, and weapon variation, and i can easily see myself playing this game for days.", "timestamp_created": 1506148099, "timestamp_updated":

[/h1]\n\nHeat Signature is essentially a \"perma-death\" heist/mercenary sandbox with a little depth and complexity. This game has no over-arching plot. There is no evil villain in the end. Instead, you progress by trying to capture all the stations in the galaxy. You unlock stations by doing missions, which comprise you flying to a ship in space, attaching to the side secretly, and completing whatever your contract may be (There are also personal missions you can do, though they serve no purpose other than recieving a weapon in return. You can name it whatever you want and your friends can find it. These aren't easy). As you unlock stations, not only do you unlock different tools, ships, and accessories that will help you as you try to progress, but also unlock new requirements for missions. These usually require you to use non-lethal weapons, not be spotted, leave no witnesses, etc. Practically every item you can unlock can already be found as you explore the galaxy and open crates in ships. However, they often have a limited amount of uses. Depending on how long your character has lived and what they have achieved, you will be able to progress at a faster rate. You keep trying to progress until your character is killed (in combat or space), captured (If you set off the alarm in the ship you are \"raiding,\" they will fly to the nearest station of whatever faction they are a part of. If you are still in the ship when it arrives, you lose your character. You or your friends can save him later though.), or willingly retires. As you can already guess, you will die [b] a lot. [/b] That being said, it's still addicting as you try to progress. \n\n[h1] Problems [/h1]\nAs great as Heat Signature premise is, I believe it has a few problems. I'd like to mention these are entirely subjective (I am aware they have a small development team. I'm disregarding this for now, since I'm just wanting to regard issues I believe it has. I'm not expecting instant content updates soon). Many might not have problems with these and I will try to provide solutions that can fix these problems for me. \n[list]\n[*] [b] Weapons. [/b] [i] Don't get me wrong, there isn't anything wrong with the weapons. They all are mechanically great and are great for whatever way you want to play. However, I believe there isn't enough for each type of playstyle. I'm finding myself favoring just a few items and disregarding half of the weapons in the game since they aren't particularly useful in many situations. [/i] \n[*] [b] Enemies. [/b] [i] They have about a dozen possible characteristics and you start to feel the loop after a while. It also can get boring visually too (if you are like me) since you run into the same enemies over and over again. [/i]\n[*] [b] Shield. [/b] [i]This is one of the characteristics of the enemies. This is a minor issue. Occassionally, you will get a mission where someone has a shield. This can be very annoying since you can only use two specific items on it. Often, I have found myself without the tools to properly handle the enemies and I have ended up losing characters over it. This can be my fault, but I believe there should be more variety with how you can handle these types of enemies. [/i]\n[*] [b] The actual game's performance. [/b] [i] As you play, the game often seems to slow down a bit. I was not the only one to experience this problem as 3 of my pals have had the same problem. Restarting the game restores the flow of things. However, it definitely breaks the flow of things. [/i]\n[*] [b] Alt-Tabbing. [/b] [i] The game looks like it has a stroke once you alt-tab out. [/i]\n[/list]\n[h1] Potential Solutions [/h1]\n[b] There are several ways to address these problems. However, these are just a few ideas off the top of my head and definitely could use some refining. So they could fix it by: [/b]\n[list] \n[*] [b] Adding Steam Workshop. [/b] [i] Personally, I believe this would add a lot of longevity to the game and allow the community to add things they would like to see in-game. However, I could see some people believing this would be an incredibly lazy move on the developers part. \n[*] [b] Just fixing performance problems and adding borderless windowed. [/b]\n[*] [b] Adding different species. [/b] [i] You could have cyborgs/bots as well as possibly some creatures. It would be very interesting to try to steal items from a ship that's infested with creatures. It would be interesting to see creatures have creative ways (such as crawling through vents, inhabiting crew-members' corpses, or equipment) to move/hide. How about having the possibility for some ships to have \"strong-willed\" bosses (not soldiers) that allow them to have a chance of surviving one attack (though it's debatable this would be a bad idea). Maybe try giving soldiers the ability to have infared that allows them to see through walls at a [b] limited [/b] distance. [/i]\n[*] [b] Of course, add weapons. [/b] [i] Since there could be cyborgs/bots, how about letting players use a remote device that allows them to take control of it for a limited time. You could take the bot and unlock doors, drop keys, or even kill one person. Once it completes it kills someone, drop keys, or the time expires, the cyborg/bot will snap out of your control and go to the location where you hacked him. Maybe add a \"goo-gun\" that allows you to keep doors shut for a limited amount of time or an enemy blows it open. Adding these would give you more flexibility and etc. Another thing that could contribute to this (though it isn't a weapon) is more types of rooms. How about a room that allows you to disable certain shields on enemies. That would help eliminate the need to always carry one of those two items that work. Maybe try adding an engine room that allows you to temporarily shut down the power (10 seconds) allowing all the doors to be opened without a key while it's down. Maybe add a navigation room (aside from the pilot's room) that allows you to temporarily redirect the ship in a different direction which in turn would buy you time. There's a lot of possibilites here and I'm sure I'm not thinking of nearly as there could be. \n\n[h1] So is it worth it? [/h1]\nDespite all the problems I have with it... [b] [u] yes.[/u] [/b] While it definitely could use more content, what you already have here is incredibly polished game with great/interesting mechanics and many possibilities. It definitely is not reaching it's full potential, but that doesn't stop it from being a good game for hours on end. If this peaked your interest, I encourage you to try it out.

It's like Grand Theft Auto 1 and Gunpoint had a lovechild, and that lovechild blasted off into space for interstellar shenanigans. It makes really good use of procedural generation by maintaining a feeling of handcrafted designs at the same time as it gives us an abundance of content.\n\nFlying around in your breaching pod is a lot of fun once you get the hang of the controls. Breaching spaceships is satisfying, and you're always in control over what sort of ships you feel like breaching thanks to missions clearly indicating what you'll encounter prior to accepting them. As the game progresses, the range of procedurally generated spaceships you are capable of successfully infiltrating increases, and so too does the range crazy things that can happen. Every bad situation you get yourself into always almost always has a way out of it... if you can pull it off. \n\nHeat Signature has the most satisfying deaths I've experienced in a game that has permadeath. It manages to find the perfect balance between the thrills of rogue-like permadeath, and a system that lets you progress so that your time isn't completely up in smoke every time your character gets killed. The way meta-progression works in Heat Signature makes absolute sense. Any individual character can be killed if things go wrong, but each character is playing their own part in a wider struggle to liberate stations across the nebula. Whatever stations they liberated, help those who follow them in taking up the cause. This results in each encounter having a feeling of risk and excitement, while each death has still put you further ahead in a wider struggle. It's very nice to see meta-progression so seamlesly executed.\n\nThe combat is easy to get into, but tricky to master. it starts off fun and continues to get more and more enjoyable with every new station unlocked. The pause menu is a key part of fighting, and the game is very tactical because of this. It's about leaning heavily on whatever items you have in your inventory and using them as best as you can. Some are limited use, so conserving those becomes a strategic choice. Planning ahead, carefully choosing the right equipment, and coming up with tactics to deal with the various things you can encounter can feel particularly satisfying. But if you don't feel like planning ahead, then just rushing in and seeing what a beautiful mess you can make of things has its own rewards.\n\nThere are ususally multiple ways to tackle any situation. Heat Signature rewards experimentation. Regardless of your playstyle, things can go horribly wrong at any moment, forcing you to think on your feat. As the developer stated, Heat Signature is about getting yourself into messed up situations, and then figuring out how to get yourself out of them in once piece. \n\nThe only criticism that I can throw at it is that the mission select console's zoom-pan out to a wide shot of the nebula can sometimes be janky and result in missions not being displayed the first time. But, it's such a minor thing and everything else about the game is so good. \n\nIt's one of those rare games where players + procedural generation = an absolute gem of a game that's way more than the sum of its parts.", "timestamp_created": 1506146928, "timestamp_updated": 1506172544, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35145030": {"recommendationid": "35145030", "author": {"steamid": "76561198091427684", "num_games_owned": 124, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1301, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511425837}, "language": "english", "review": "I have watched almost every devlog on his youtube channel and followed Francis since before Heat Signature was beginning development and it has culminated into an amazing game.

I can't really describe the game better than the game already does, but I will say it does meet its expectations 100% in terms of not super-plot heavy, but instead it's the personal \"epic\" feel of personalized missions.\n\nI bought the game today, and within the first 2 hours, figured out how to wander around complete several missions, including a few medium difficulty missions; accumulated enough cash to fund my \"Personalized Mission\"- but realized I'm going to need more resources in order to complete it, and was able to locate the Unique Ship to get the special first two week promotional bonus gun \"The Everything Gun\"... which would lead to my last mission of the night and the one that sums up the fun of the game:\n\nMy Hero Casacara was tasked to complete a \"Bloodless\" mission- to infiltrate a ship, assassinate a target and walk away without killing any other members. It was going to be my first Bloodless mission, but seemed easy. My intel noted it would be a skeleton crew, the Alarm was going to be around 90 seconds to get in and get out if I was spotted, and it was a small ship.\" Easy-peasy lemon squeezy,\" my agent thought: \"I've already liberated a base; I've got plenty of rare items, and I even have this sweet Unique new gun. Let's take a wrench, my stun gun, and the new gun and get in and out.\"\n\nCasacara docked onto the skeleton ship a few mins later (docking is still tricky, but I'm getting the hang of it). And a quick recon over the base showed my intel was true: 3 people on the ship: A pilot, a guard by the door, and the target himself. \"This is too easy\"- I thought to myself. Casacara quickly opened the door, threw the wrench and knocked out the guard. She stepped into the room, and saw the Target was two rooms over and checking his data pads, the pilot was a distance away at the aft of the ship. Her plan was simple- use the new unique Everything Gun to make a distraction, cause the Target to run up, and then bam! Stun and snap his neck. Easy-Peasy. \n\nCasacara shot the everything gun at the wall, causing it to suck up the nearby wrench and fling it at the wall, when the wrench struck the wall- bounced off- and struck Casacara in the face, knocking her out!! I stared dumbstruck as my character was unconcious, the Target heard the ruckus, and sounded the alarm, causing the 90 second timer to countdown before the ship would escape and I'd be out of luck. The target came over to my unconcious agent, grabbed her and started to drag her away- I watched the timer to see if I was going to regain conciousness, while that counter went down to 80 seconds... 79...78... and suddenly the Target opened the airlock and sucked out my Agent into the cold vacuum of space!\n\nI stared stunned, as I lucky had my autopilot on my ship, but I had to quickly fly over to grab my character's body before we ran out of oxygen- and then just as I picked her up, and contemplated my next move- I realized the Alarm countdown was still going- I had less than 60 seconds to complete the mission! Casacara quickly woke up and gunned it to chase after that ship- but she overshot the distance and ended up in it's headlights- The Pilot now seeing my ship, fired rockets and blew out my engines blasting me away from the target. I had to quickly perform evasive manuevers as Casacara and I realized we lost that mission, and my engines were blown out and now I'm on emergency fuel and unsure if I could get back home....\n\nHowever, I could still see the ship nearby, with it's countdown at 45 seconds. I gritted my teeth- I hadn't failed a mission yet! We punched the engines, burning our fuel as we caught up to the ship. Casacara opened the airlock door and with the counter on 30 seconds now, we came out stun guns blazing and knocked out the Target, who was suprised to see the would-be-assassin that he had thrown out the airlock and whom his pilot had blown out of the sky now returned! It would be the last thing he saw as he was concussed and quickly his neck snapped. I debated taking out the pilot, but realized I had no time! I quickly dashed back into my ship, and then used the remainer of my emergency fuel to drift back towards home base....\n\nIt was supposed to be a simple mission- a skeleton crew of 3, and I had done missions with 20+ guards and taken them all out, but I had not expected the unexpected, and the countdown only added to the pressure. It's just one random mission, nothing contributory to the plot- but it was a small tiny moment of awesome! \n\nIf those tiny moments in a rogue-like are what you're looking for- this game is perfect for you- if you're looking for a game that's going to give you 100+ hours of plot, dialogue and multiplayer- this is NOT the game for you. \n\nI know I'm hooked though.

Its fun to blow up an entire ship but sometimes i want a knife to stab em before i blow em up)\n\nWhen you bring an enemy ship to your station, you can use it to board enemy ships, and you can hire people to work aboard it, and your AI will hunt down the enemy AI. Somthing like that, i think it would be cool\n\nOnline Multiplayer (Hear me out) - AI Reactions slowed down 1.5 - 2 seconds, no slow time when your spotted by them, Everybody can get their own pod, and you can all do whatever, completing misions and stuff, working for one of the 5 factions. (Which would work well with the above idea) Allow multiple people to get into a pod (Via teleporter on a station, if a pod is within a certain distance). I thought it would be cool to see. Also, allow freindly fire so i could whack my freinds with a wrench\n\nSuggestions for Player: Stack tons of unconcious bodies in an engine room (Like 30) and blow them all into space.

I whole heartedly recommend this game, and so far I only have 4 hours and feel it was worth the money, which is the mark of a very good game. The moment that solidifies how good the game is, is when you are almost out of items, and your plan is no longer possible, and in fact there is no plan. You're ready to give up on saving your husband and admitting defeat, surrounded by panicked guards. You realize you haven't a particular item yet, in my case the emergency shield. Well, why not, what's the worst that could happen. You buckle up, pick up your husband, and go for it, and there are no words to describe the joy and tension in the next few seconds, where every single move you make counts. There are no words to describe how amazing it is to discover that you can fire a glitch trap with the everything gun and it will work, or the feeling of being chased by an angry guard on your tail with a wrench and throwing away your husband at the last second in order to put your last shield back on, then shooting the window and catching both your husband and yourself and completeing the mission. This game is full of moments you don't expect to happen that will completely make this game for you, and it is completely personalized so don't expect a review to predict those moments for you.\nOne suggestion that will likely never be seen but anywho, closure would go a long way in this game. For example, being able to talk to a rescued family member, in a very limited way maybe, seeing a character who is retired playing space golf in the bar with their new family member, seeing a wake in the bar for a deceased friend. Of course these are probably very complicated to pull of, and it's not a make or break things, but it's just a suggestion that would make a really fun exciting game just that little bit more amazing even after the you've completed a personal mission. \nIn summary, the game is absolutely fantastic and definitely worth the price but the personal missions could be a bit more personal in the long run.", "timestamp_created": 1506130408, "timestamp_updated": 1506130408, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35140744": {"recommendationid": "35140744", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007984135", "num_games_owned": 777, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1355, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507855101}, "language": "english", "review": "This is an exceptionally good videogame.

I love being able to run in, take down a bunch of enemies, and then move on to the next set. I will say it is a bit repetitive but it isn't a big deal to me. My one problem is that when you lose a player, for the most part, they are gone forever and you can never finish their story. It would be nice to be able to retry when you die like in Gunpoint but I do see how adding this would make the game too easy. There is a chance that a new character has a personal quest to rescue a captured character though which is nice. The gameplay is fun and keeps me entertained so far.

I lost my first dude this way \n\n2.   if the timer for capture starts  then leaving the ship does not reset it. if you return the timer could be at 0 and you are instantly captured...I lost my second dude this way.    \n\n3.   if you blow up a room you get sucked out into space...this can cause a mission to be unbeatable if the goal and the only airlock are now seperated by the vacuum of space.     this is how I lost my first mission.....\n\n\nyou can fly around and just latch onto ships and take thier stuff or follow missions to get paid.   controls are pretty easy and the ability to pause and make decisions makes for some wacky tactics and reminds me of the first Matrix.  There is also a method of capturing new stations which unlocks new equipment and some special challange missions.  \n\nI am spending all day trying to find the special ship that contains a weapon that I can find in my game forever if I find it before the 5th......DEVS that is an awesome way to introduce a reward.      \n\nI hope my review is helpful to somebody but i just had to express my love for this game", "timestamp_created": 1506118714, "timestamp_updated": 1506118714, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35138870": {"recommendationid": "35138870", "author": {"steamid": "76561198150255371", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 919, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512254233}, "language": "english", "review": "A lot like Hotline Miami, but with a lot of extra bells and whistles.

These objectives can range from assassinations, to heists. These missions are randomly generated based on certain parameters.\n\nDifficulty is the overall difficulty of the mission, and affects everything from the size of the ship, to the amount and gear of the enemies.\n\nEach mission also gives the enemy a different 'kit', which gives them abilities that range from heat sensors, to total immunity to damage. While some are obviously more difficult than others, there's always a way to circumvent, and with the correct gear, can actually make enemies with certain kits easier than without.\n\nAnd finally, the objective. An objective is one of the few concrete things in a mission. And although there aren't too many different objectives, you'll be hard pressed to find the exact same mission twice. The way you can approach the objective is more akin to Dishonored then Hotline Miami. You could go in full Rambo, duel wielding quickfire shotguns to quickly dispose of waves of enemis, dodging bullets using the slow motion. You could use teleportation, and a stealth field to quietly reach your objective, only to swapper teleport into your pod, using the unconcious body you cleverly placed there.\n\nThe approaches to the different mission makes up for the few different objectives, and makes sure that each mission will feel different.\n\nNow in terms of game mechanics, this game has it great. A big, and quite noticable feature, is the ability to slow time down in tough situations. This hammers home the game's emphasis on planning, and allows the player to plan and execute on the fly. And if that's not enough, you can also pause the game, allowing more time to plan. You can even start an action, like aim, or teleport while paused, allowing highly precise actions.\n\nAnd speaking of teleporting, this game has a vast armory of different gadgets, all allowing almost endless veriety in the way you approach missions. This can range from a simple silenced pistol, to a slow motion device, to a gun that shoots everything. And most of these things can come with upgraded versions. Like a teleporter that recharges during the mission, or a keycard copy device that works at a massive distance.\n\n\nOf course, all games must have cons, and in my opinion, this game has a few.\n\nThe art style is quite nice looking, and I love the look of the ships, but it's sometimes quite difficult to see enemies, or keycards on the ground. Keycards can just be teleported to you, but it can be a bit shocking for an enemy to suddenly appear in the seemingly empty room. This is more a problem with enemies without kits, but the multi colored armor of the Glitchers can be almost the exact same color of the equally multi colored rooms they're in.\n\nSometimes the mission generation can be a bit unfair. There was one instance in which all of my missions had armored enemies, but I didn't have an armor piercing weapon yet. It's almost always possible to complete a mission as such, but sometimes it's better to just abort a mission to get a new list.\n\nFinally, the AI is mediocre. When they spot you, they're much better at searching for your location, but when they're idle, they have a nasty tendency to walk to terminals, all by themselves. This makes it possible to simply wait for an enemy to split, kill/knockout the enemy, hide the body, and then simply wait for the next guy to come in. Although it trivializes some stealth missions, the kits eventually made it much more difficult, and actually sometimes encouraged group fighting, in order to make the most of your own gadgets.\n\n\nAnd finally, something that could be a bad thing to more than a few, and that's the difficulty.\n\nThe game can, at times, get very difficult. Fighting against enemies with impenetrable shields is one, but fighting shielded, teleporting enemies with shotguns, and turrets on every corner in a huge ship with a pacifist tag is around where this game takes some planning. Of course, by that point the player will have a character with many different gadgets on hand, and could kill with a glance - these missions can still prove troublesome. Luckily, you always can choose a different mission, and you are never forced into a mission that you wouldn't want to do. (Assassination mission with a non-lethal character, anyone?)\n\nOverall, this game is great. It can be difficult at times, but the feeling of beating a mission which is even considered impossible in-game makes the feeling so much greater. I've yet to see a game make you feel like someone out of an action movie as well as this game.\n\nRecommend this game for anyone who loves thinking on their toes, and enjoyed games like Hotline Miami, or Dishonored.", "timestamp_created": 1506107873, "timestamp_updated": 1506107873, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502712", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35135352": {"recommendationid": "35135352", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024950145", "num_games_owned": 407, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1221, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506947122}, "language": "english", "review": "My job was to assassinate Avita Venatici and kill no one else.

Let me tell you a story.\n\nMy mission was to rescue a guy from on board an enemy ship, but still being relatively new to the game at the time, I didn't know the armor of the guards on the ship would be too strong for any weapons I had in my posession at the time.\n\nI decided to make my way through this HUGE ship without picking up any of the keycards, because I didn't have a keycloner, or a weapon capable of taking out the armored guards... I had a self-recharging Sidewinder (teleporter that teleports you anywhere within range, as long as there is an unbroken path between you and the destination..) and a crappy little pistol.\n\nI was using the pistol to fire a few shots to lure guards toward a door, running away from the door, then teleporting to a place on the other side of the now-open door and continuing on.  On board the ship, I located a Subverter, which made dealing with the stationary turrets a lot less stressful, and I eventually made my way to my target, only to be faced with a new problem... I didn't have any keycards, so how do I get out?\n\nI formulated a plan.. two rooms away was a room with a window... using a clever combination of shooting, teleporting, carrying my rescue target around to different places, luring guards, and getting a few more doors open, while also taking my objective with me, I find myself in the room with the window finally.. except after I teleported, I mis-clicked and accidentally fired a round, which attracted the attention of the guards.  \n\nAs soon as my gun was ready to fire again, and the enemy guards were pouring into the room while I stood in the corner, I shot the window and flung myself, my objective, and 3 or 4 enemies out into the vaccuum of space, due to the sudden decompression..  I pull up my menu, select my pod, and remote controlled it to scoop up my objective, then myself before we ran out of air, then burned out of there and back to a friendly base.\n\nThat's just one of many stories I already have from this game.  9/10 game automatically already, simply because you CAN'T get a gameplay experience like that just anywhere, it takes a special, rare game, and this is one of them.

I took a job on a foundry ship a few weeks into my career and the contract told me not to kill anyone but by the time I got on the ship I had a turret staring me dead in the face, so I subverted it, turned it on my side and accidentally killed three people. Guess I'm going loud. The only other problem I had in that room (other than the fact that I was equipped with a wrench in lieu of my usual longsword that I named Eddie) was a shielded guard to my left, I subverted his shield and made him shoot him self in the face. \n\nThat's how Boden loads 'em. \n\nAfter that I still had about 700 feet of ship and 20 to maybe 100 guards standing in my way to hijack the son'gun. I got through the first few rooms pretty easy, stayed out of sight of the other shielded guards to save my last subverter charge while knocking out the weaker ones on my way to the pilot. By the time I got to the pilot though I ran into a problem, one of the son'benches saw me and I had to act quick, I knocked out the pilot and ran away from the shielded guard who yelled out to the rest of his crew that there was a badarse on board, dam near got shot by one of the maybe 50 to 100 turrets on board during my escape.\n\nAfter finding a nice corner to catch my breath in, I stole some keys with my key cloner and went into one of the stash rooms on board since I knew I'd be safe there. Let me give you a bit of Boden history while I got you here, I am the luckiest son'gun you will ever see, my momma told me a leprechuan with a necklace of horse shoes delivered me unto the world, well my momma always liked her moonshine but I believe her, my guns are silent quick and powerful, my tools are unmatched, I have a rechargeable stealth shield, subverter, long range key cloner, and swapper, and that was just on me at the time, but when I tell you I am the LUCKIEST son'gun you will ever see I'm not talking fairytales. \n\nIn that stash room I found nothing else but the fabled, rechargeable slipstream, now I can not properly describe how paramount this was to my eventual completion of this mission. The room outside these doors was covered in guards, like rats in a brothel, but with my final subverter charge a well timed stealth shield and the 10 seconds the slipstream gave me of superhuman speed, I subverted a turret nearby, went back to the stash room and watched the bodies fly.\n\nBut there was one problem with my plan, I was out of subverter charges and there were still maybe 3 to 1000 shielded guards on the ship, there was no way I could hijack the son'gun with them around, so I knew what I had to do, the first guy my new turret killed threw him into a nearby window and broke it, I threw myself out of it (badarse) called my ship nd went back to home base to recharge, luckily since the pilot was out their ship was just drifting out in space while I did this, and boy oh boy was it lucky, I grabbed Eddie and my gun and went back for revenge, long story short those shield boys were a bit suicidal if you catch my drift heheh.\n\n10/10 would tell shielded guard \"Why ya hittin' yourself\" again.", "timestamp_created": 1506080934, "timestamp_updated": 1506080934, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35125785": {"recommendationid": "35125785", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014968589", "num_games_owned": 219, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 247, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512226599}, "language": "english", "review": "I have no words for this game.

Which is briefly stated in the briefing you usually get. \n\nIn a way this game reminds me of the Shadowrun games we played in the university on pen and paper. Minutes of planning which goes to shit due to unforeseen circumstances and you have to lethally improvise new plan in seconds. But thanks to freeze&play and time slowing this is done in a very controllable manner. Weirdly, even though the action is in slo mo, it leaves a fast&furious experience afterwards. You see a guard, blast him down with a shottie, then the other guard shoots, you switch places to make him eat his own bullet and drop a grenade to a room with glasses which the target resides, it explodes taking the target to vacuum in which he aphixiates. \n\nThe basic gameplay mechanics are super fun, the rest is icing on the cake. The equipments, rarity and speciality of equipments, missions, how you approach... everything is randomized or left to you. I haven't done an approach like this yet but I've heard people capturing other ships to attack to the target's ship. I see no reason this can't be done. \n\nAll in all this is a very replayable, long and fun game.

And you're not getting another drop until you pay up.\"\n\n\"Now w-wait a minute Benny, I rescued your wife from...from that spaceship, remember? Drinks were...f-f-free for me?\"\n\n\"EX-wife. She's suing me for half of this Goddamn bar, so you'd better pay up soon or you can get your dopey butt off of this asteroid!\"\n\nOrcell slicked back his bright purple hair and groaned, heaving himself off the stool and over to the weapon shops. Breaching was excellent money, and one more death-defying ship hijacking would be all he'd need to keep Benny knee-deep in credits for the next 2 months.\n\nThe weapons dealer eyed him suspiciously.\n\n\"Yo, you drunk? Whatever, I got what you need bro. Glitch Traps, Sidewinders, Swappers, Quietguns, Longblades, Prankspasms-\"\n\"None of that. Pass me that Whackactivated Ridged Energy Neutralising Cranial Hammer system.\"\n\"What?\"\n\"The wrench. Pass me the freakin' wrench. I'll give you five bucks for it.\"\n\"Errrr....deal. I guess?\"\n\nMoments later Orcell was chatting to a shady figure on a vid screen, idly patting his free hand with the big spanner reassuringly. Or menacingly, depending on your point of view.\n\n\"Orcell. We need you to assassinate a guy named August. He's a tactical genius and he's doing crazy damage to us in the war effort. It's got to be quick, it's got to be clean, it's got to be EFFICIENT. You down?\"\n\"What's...what's the pay?\"\n\"Good God I can smell the liquor through this vidscreen. I'm not sure I want you for this mis-\"\n\"No, fine, I'll do it, whatever!\"\n\nBurping as he entered the airlock, Orcell heaved himself into his little ship. Drunkenly pawing the controls of his pod, Orcell raced at relativistic speeds towards his prey...a large whale of a Foundry vessel. With an awful screech, the pod thundered down the hull of the ship and pounded into the little docking nook.\n\n\"They won't have heard that.\" He thought. \"Total stealth.\"\n\nThe first guard he encountered was a young woman, with neat bunned hair and the cool blue uniform of all Foundry employees. She was quite a beauty, though her nose looked squashed, crooked. Perhaps a relic from a beating from a Breacher long past? Orcell couldn't help but think that if he'd found her in the bar he'd probably be making futile attempts to convince her to snog her face right now.\n\n\"Hm, she looks like a decent lass. No need for unnecessary violence here, I can just tiptoe-\"\n\nCREAK. His big drunken clodhopper had dislodged a nearby grating. Up ahead, the guard drew a mean-looking blaster and began to walk towards him at a brisk pace.\n\nOrcell fell quickly into a little cubby, trying to will himself not to drop into a liquor fuelled snooze. She was close now. He could read the name on her badge: \"SARAH, HAPPY TO HELP.\" It was unfortunate, but there was only one course of action. It was that or be shot.\n\nWHAMCRUNCH. The guard recoiled as the huge wrench landed a vicious overhead blow. There was the faint tinkle of teeth on metal and she slammed so hard into the wall that she left a slight imprint.\n\n\"He...help me...? Whyyyyy...?\" She croaked, passing into merciful unconsciousness as Orcell lifted her dropped gun.\n\n\"Bloodless.\" Thought Orcell, smugly. \"There won't be a single innocent casualty on this mission, 'cos I'm a PROFESSIONAL.\"\n\nHe stepped over Sarah's limp body and gently tucked a card for Intergalactic Plastic Surgery Inc. into her tunic. Guards got good pay, she'd be fine. Probably.\n\nA short walk away and he came to the Captain, plugged into the vessel's computers and steering it towards it's destination. Or playing Sweetie Block Crush in VR...it never was 100% clear what he was doing, exactly. The WRENCH device once again sang it's holy song.\n\nA few more corridors and he spotted a wiry, clever looking man directing two lieutenants. This must be his target. Within moments he would be ending this poor fella's life. Orcell didn't like killing, and he felt a twinge of guilt. But the money was the important thing. \"Tactical genius. Better be careful. BURRRP.\"\n\nHe crept further towards the room and then noticed, with horror, that they'd already spotted him. The corridor was too far away...August had his blaster out and Orcell was dead in the crosshairs. This was it. Game over. He was going to die, and he was going to die drunk.\n\n\"FAIRCELL HORSEPLAY! I HAVE BEEN EXPECTING YOU!\"\n\n\"PEW.\" August's blaster rang out clear as day, firing at the interloper once. Orcell closed his eyes and waited for death. And waited. And waited. Then...an awful splintering-fiery crash. The bullet had struck a fuel tank, and August screamed incoherently as he was sucked into a yawning hull breach of his own making.\n\n\"That's hardly fairplay.\" Orcell quipped, facepalming at himself afterwards.\n\n\"Target eliminated.\" His headset informed him, the ship settling into silence. \"Bloodless.\" Orcel thought once again, exceedingly smugly.\n\nHe passed back over the slumbering Sarah, catching sight of her unhinged jaw. She was unemployed now, and the Foundry probably wouldn't be best pleased with her. He paused for a long moment, staring at the ceiling...and then gingerly scooped her up, carrying her gently towards the Pod.\n\nBack at the asteroid he saluted his employer, and grabbed his cash. A few hours later he was at the bar, showcasing a big goofy smile to Benny.\n\n\"That's only half the money.\" Benny muttered. \"The job gave you three times what was needed, I checked. Where's the rest Orcell? You holding out on me?\"\n\n\"This lovely lady is Sarah. We just got back from a fruitful trip to Intergalactic Plastic Surgery Inc. Pour two whiskies and we'll have a toast. Actually scratch that, I'll have a water.\"\n\nBenny scoffed incredulously as he got the drinks.\n\n\"To new noses, and new beginnings. Never thought I'd be drinking with a Breacher.\" Sarah said, flashing Orcell an awkward grin.\n\n\"To new beginnings.\" Orcell echoed. \"And one more mission...\" He thought, catching Benny's money-hungry glare. \n\n\"One more mission.\"", "timestamp_created": 1506066733, "timestamp_updated": 1506067281, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.529570", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35122584": {"recommendationid": "35122584", "author": {"steamid": "76561198279011466", "num_games_owned": 74, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 326, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511088028}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041e\u0444\u0438\u0433\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430!\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0438\u0442 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0438\u0445 \u0434\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0433, \u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u044f\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0430 \u043d\u0435 \u0445\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0430\u0435\u0442", "timestamp_created": 1506066628, "timestamp_updated": 1506066628, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.563492", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35122492": {"recommendationid": "35122492", "author": {"steamid": "76561197976082861", "num_games_owned": 540, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 205, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511387704}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutely wonderful little game that sucked me in and didn't let go.

Overall, instead of interesting decision making and planning you are often left to just figure out the best way to exploit the simple AI...and that's fun for a while, it's just not the experience I wanted.\n\nThe game idea is amazing. and I'll probably give it another go eventually, until a new game pops up to pass the time at lunch.

As far as I can tell, when you die that story is lost forever and you start a new character with a new motivation, so don't get too invested. I'm guessing the backstories are also randomly generated so expect to see them usually boil down to kill/rescue/recover someone or something.\n\nThe game in general is a good idea but anyone looking for an experience with depth will be disappointed or frustrated.

Gameplay's a bit like Hotline Miami, but with the ability to pause during combat to plan out your moves, aim shots, and whatnot.  It's also a rogue-light-lite, in a sense.  Characters hardly last one hour, whether it's due to you retiring them (once a character does their fair share of missions, their ability to contribute to the main cause depletes), or them dying in some fashion.  It's also rogue-light-lite in the sense that outright 'failure' is hard to accomplish.  Usually getting caught means you're shot out the airlock and start to bleed out to death, and have to catch yourself with your escape/breach pod before you fully die.  You have 30 seconds bleed-out time, period, so the more you get vented, the less time you'll have to live.  Missions are also tend to be hard to fail.  Things won't go to plan, but chances are you probably won't outright fail the mission.\n\nAllow me to provide an example: Enter Babu Polk, on her personal mission for revenge.  To capture the captain that had killed her mother.  Now, personal missions for characters tend to be some of the hardest in the game, and this ship was definitely no slouch.  The guards were armed with personal teleporters that allowed them to investigate suspicious activity instantly, the captains armored with emergency shields and armor plating, and the ships was armed head to toe with sentry guns.  Our hero is equipped with an array of personal teleporters, key-copiers, a self-charging teleporter trap (great for sending guards to space!) and a really heavy hammer.  A heavy armament, well-planned, a simple mission.\n\nThe first squad Babu encountered had a captain.  The captain had armor.  The hammer doesn't pierce armor.  I had forgotten this.\n\nThe capture target is also armored.  I had also forgotten this.\n\nWhat follows is a ridiculous chase around the ship in an attempt to knock out the pilot of the vessel before a two minute alarm expired.  Hammers were swung, tossed, teleported back into hand and swung again.  Locked doors were teleported past to knock out the guard that had the keycard and steal it for myself.  Armored guards were lured into traps to jettison them out into space.  Babu herself got shot and vented out the airlock twice in all the commotion.  After tossing or knocking out about 80% of the ship's crew, the caper finally ended when our heroine took to the helm of the ship, flew it to an allied station, entered, sold off everything she had, and bought up a non-lethal, armor-piercing assault rifle to capture the target.\n\nThis is the main allure of Heat Signature.  Getting a plan, grabbing tools, and then screwing it up hilariously.  The thing is, screwing things up tends to never be the end of the world.  The game is rather generous with the various gadgets and gizmos it gives you, and all neccessary information is given upfront from mission select: map size, guard/captain modifiers, time limits and alerts.  So while your plan to wait out the guards to access terminals and knock them out one by one may have failed, you probably do have the tools to rewire the sentry guns, a teleporter to jump into the room with the mission-loot, and a gun to shoot the window and launch yourself into space, remote-piloting the pod to pick you up before you run out of breath.\n\nAs they say in Dwarf Fortress, losing is fun.  And while you may not lose, per say, things will not go to plan.\n\nAnd man, is it fun when they don't.", "timestamp_created": 1506052994, "timestamp_updated": 1506052994, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35119576": {"recommendationid": "35119576", "author": {"steamid": "76561198399861009", "num_games_owned": 75, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1554, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511594051}, "language": "english", "review": "A unique and intresting concept executed perfectly.

His sister had been killed by the Glitchers; specifically, by a man named Gio Estralda. With a heart of fire, Elvashak raced to find the best way to exact revenge. And, as luck would have it, he became the main character... For a short while. With his Longblade and Rechargeable High Capacity Stealth Shield, he was ready!\n\nElvashak amassed a large sum of money through missions of three difficulty types; Easy, Medium, and Hard. With his blade and shield in hand, he managed to gather what almost seemed to be randomized, but useful, loot, such as a Rechargeable Glitch Trap and Quiet Quickfire Gun.\n\nWith his money, he paid for intel on his sister's killer. He tracked the man down to the exact ship, but when he boarded, Elvashak was blown away. Literally. A turret shot him and he was thrown out of the airlock.\n\nHis breaching pod managed to catch him, however, and bring him back to safety! Elvashak, now being far more careful, found the ship to be much, much larger than any he had encountered before. Try as he might, Elvashak could not overcome the huge amounts of guards and sentry turrets. Taking out six men, Elvashak felt himself thrown into space yet again. Once again catching himself with his remote controlled pod, he boarded for what he knew was the last time. He would make one last effort and, failing that, retreat and try again at another point in time.\n\nUnforeseen by him, however, was the explosion of an engine. The ship was split apart, and he managed to get very, very close to his sister's killer. The ship, on the other hand, was fast approaching its destination. As the countdown ticked away, he decided to retreat. As his pod pulled away, he was blasted by an array of missiles. Barely hitting the proper buttons to keep the pod from breaking the part, he relaxed in his chair.\n\nThe day was done, and he would come back another day. That is, he would have. If he hadn't been on emergency fuel.\n\nTry as he might, he could not get the trajectory correct; and once the fuel was out, life support disengaged. After multiple successful missions, liberating a station, and coming so close to avenging his sister's death, Elvashak was left to die from lack of oxygen, his pod drifting away from the known galaxy.\n\n\n\nAnyways, that's Heat Signature. Randomized loot, what feels like a personal story each and every time,  and a very intriguing retirement system that I didn't experience with Elvashak. Seems that when your character retires, he goes down as a \"Living Legend\" and can name one of his items. This item can be found by later characters you make and by your Steam friends!

I was gutted when the beta ended and I had to wait a whole day for it to come out.\n\nHeat Signature has experimented in a number of areas and as far as I'm concerned it's gotten them absolutely right.\n\nFirst off the in the action-stealth-tactical-shooter-stabby gameplay, the way you're allowed to pause at any moment to consider your next move, the way time slows down when you aim or when you're spotted, the way you have just a very short window to take out a guard before they sound the alarm, it all works incredibly well, and it feels fantastic.  When you get it right you feel like you ONLY JUST MADE IT, LIKE A BOSS, and when you get it wrong, it's almost always because you rushed in and didn't plan your next move right.  My big mistake early on was not learning to pause often enough, but once I figured out that I needed to execute an action and then pause immediately to set up the next move, everything just clicked.\n\nThe other big innovation is in the rogue-lite gameplay.  Permadeath can be frustrating, but I feel like this game strikes a balance between paying for your mistakes with the loss of your character, and feeling a sense of real progression in between characters.  The world map keeps progressing, you can switch between characters when one of them reaches an impasse, and you keep unlocking new gear as you go along, with a random chance to find or buy really epic, overpriced gear.  Each character has a personal mission they're working towards, and when they die it does hurt, but if you pay attention you can always bail on a mission and try another one.  You have multiple chances to rescue them.  One of my favourite feelings is bailing on a mission by smashing a window and flying out into space, then remote controlling my pod to pick me up before I run out of oxygen.\n\nAlso, I don't know if I missed the information somewhere in the game, but it's worth knowing that if you don't succeed at a personal mission the first time, you can always bail and try again.  I didn't realise that and I lost a few characters thinking I had to finish the mission in a single go, so I was 100% committed and I didn't bail when I could have.\n\nAnyway, if you liked Hotline Miami, Dishonored, Deus Ex, Frozen Synapse, Commandos, Gunpoint, Nuclear Throne, Caveblazers, Monaco, Mark of the Ninja, basically anything in the rogue-like, action-stealth or tactical genres, then this game is for you.

Fortunately you can pause the game whenever you want for how long you want.\n\nThe trailer is a pretty good description of the core gameplay but what is really interesting is how the game handles failure:\n\nIf you get hit by an enemy, you will become unconcious and the guards will throw you in space. You then have a limited time to remote control your rescue pod and pick yourself up again just to redock with the ship you just got thrown off and try to kill the guard that just knocked you out last time. The kicker: Everytime they get you, the limited time you have to pick up your body gets reduced. When you are not quick enough, your character dies (permanently).\nAbout character death: As long as your character is alive, you can retire him. If you do so, he will show up in the hall of \"Living Legends\" with all the things listed he achieved. But if he dies before you retire him, he is just gone. So you always have to decide \"Do I want to retire this character now or do I risk getting one more awesome thing on the list?\".\nIf you fail a mission by getting captured (triggering the alarm and not leaving the ship before it reaches a space station) you can pick a new character who's personal mission is to rescue your previous character!\n\nMore details and gameplay: https://youtu.be/ujDVCAecRe4", "timestamp_created": 1506034714, "timestamp_updated": 1506035462, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.455453", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35115502": {"recommendationid": "35115502", "author": {"steamid": "76561198096308553", "num_games_owned": 596, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 1096, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511407570}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing space game.

Those guards all teleported into the room, and the rest walked over to investigate. However, I had left the prisoner in the room where all the guards were now. I quickly realised the original guard room had a window, so I fired the shotgun at the wall, gathering about 20 guards into the room, and then I shot the window and teleported away.

They are the pause mechanic, and teleportation items. With these two additions, the game went from a fairly simple top down action game to something incredibly tactical, unpredictable, and truly beautiful.\n\nThe premise of Heat Signature is pretty simple: you fly around an area of space in a tiny, weaponless ship that can dock undetected with larger ships. Dock with a ship, and suddenly (and seamlessly) you're onboard, running around with the WASD keys. Ships are procedurally generated and vary in size and difficulty, so each one will play out differently. Both you and the guards onboard have access to a wide variety of guns, grenades, teleporters, and other items and your aim is normally to sneak through the ship and steal something, or assassinate/rescue/capture something.\n\nSneaking through a ship you've docked with rarely goes to plan, and this is where the excellent pause mechanic comes into play. At any time, you can hit the spacebar, pausing the game. This is essential, as without pausing, firefights in Heat Signature normally last about 0.3 seconds and end up with you bleeding out on the floor. You could play without using the pause function - it might be fun if you thought Hotline: Miami was a bit easy and slow-paced... For the rest of us, pausing the game allows us to breathe, and take stock of the situation. Ok, I just ran into this room and was spotted by four guards with shotguns. Another two guards have just teleported in behind me, there's approximately 136 shotgun pellets about five feet away from my face, and I have no ammo. Shit. However, I do have a visitor teleporter. I use this to temporarily teleport to an adjacent room. The shotgun pellets pass through the empty space I was just occupying and smash into the window behind. It shatters, and all six guards go flying out into space. The window's automatic force-field activates just as the visitor teleporter wears off and I return to my original position. I stick my hands in my space-pockets and walk away, whistling.\n\nSurviving situations that seem unsurvivable is what Heat Signature is all about. Try doing all of the above with another ship firing missiles at the ship you're on, blowing massive chunks out of it (ships are not just procedurally generated, but fully destructable too). It's fun, it's intense, and amid all of the chaos, it carries all of the hallmarks of excellent design that you'd expect from Tom Francis.\n\nAnother commendable aspect of the game is the graphics - they are unique and gorgeous, while, most importatly, always staying entirely readable even amidst the most chaotic missions.

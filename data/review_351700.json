In all my hours so far (of which I spent quite a few hunting), I did not encounter a single one. You do hear them, though. And hope they stay far away...\n\nOh, and if you do find one, it will very likely be deadly. Combat in general is deadly in this game. Even small game like a wolverine might already cause a wound that can kill you if unprepared. And even if you start out with good combat stats, you will be lacking in other stats and have a hard time surviving.\n\nOf course, you will not have to worry about a single wolf. As is realistic, they hunt in packs. A single bear is more deadly than a wolf, of course, but I don't see how anyone but a perfectly equipped seasoned warrior would be able to bring a pack of wolves down.\n\nAnd finally... you won't get 50xp as this game has no XP or even a level system. You have skills and they improve by using them. And since combat is very deadly... well, let's just say it would be a good idea to train a very long time before setting out for trouble.\n\n[b]What CAN you do then?[/b]\nAs of writing this review, I spent about 25 hours building a hut next to a lake to survive the winter. \nBy falling trees, cutting them into logs and boards, building all those walls and floors and of course the fireplace. \nAll of that while having to catch fish to eat, hunting and trapping game in the wilderness to skin and tan the hides (a multi-step days spanning process), taking care of my wounds because a crazed wolverine attacked me and almost killed my poor reindeer companion and continuously trading whatever I could to afford better tools, weapons and dried food for the winter months - because I do not yet have a smoking cabin, nor is it winter to dry my fishes.\n\nAnd the best part: Every single step listed here is governed by skills that you create your character with and that will slowly improve over time. So not only a true survival game but also a true RPG.\n\nOh, and all those things I mentioned do not even cover half of all the mechanics of this game.", "timestamp_created": 1513963724, "timestamp_updated": 1513963870, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38502297": {"recommendationid": "38502297", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070917153", "num_games_owned": 94, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 207, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 207, "last_played": 1514246350}, "language": "english", "review": "Its been almost a year since my adventure began. Since I struck out from my home village where I had lived my entire to experience the greater world. For months I desperately scraped together a meagre existence, fishing, hunting rabbits, trapping foxes and when desperate enough, stealing from villages under the cover of darkness. My mind casts over all of my numerous near death experiences. Ive been tracked by a pack of wolves, fallen off a cliff, butted by a bull elk and wrestled by a fully grown bear.\n\n My most dangerous foe however, a lone poorly armed Njerpez raider, half starved and half frozen. It was a savage affair, arrows were notched at range, spear struck sword in close combat and countless blows were exchanged. Strike after strike after strike. Our weapons had been lost in the struggle, we drew knives. Blade bites flesh. We were exhausted, both bleeding from a dozen wounds. Our knives were lost too. We wrestled like two worn out boxers. He collapsed and I fell on him like a spider. I lifted a heavy stone and brought it down on his face, over and over. He finally lets out one last rattling breath. I collapsed in the snow beside him and woke hours later unable to walk. It took me two days to drag myself back to camp eating roots, weeds and a frozen bird carcass to survive. I saw things in the woods at night.\n\nBut that was then and this is now, its different you know.\n\nIm standing tall at the edge of a river, a Njerpez camp lying empty in my wake. Im wearing skis, thick furs, a battered iron helmet and gauntlets aswell as thick mail shirt. I feel like a giant, no man can fell me, my long axe has drank the blood of many Njerpez today. I begin to stride across the thick ice of the frozen river.\n\nI am a different man than the one that set out all those seasons ago, in the thaw I shall use the waterways to travel far and wide to seek out other figthers to test my mettle agaisnt, yes, I will be a warrior of the greatest renown in all of the Unrea- *Crack*\n\nIs the ice as thick as I thought it was?\n\n*Splash*\n\nSwimming in freezing water is hard, swimming in freezing water wearing fifty pounds of iron armour and over laden with battle trophies is impossible. Exhaustion and coldwater shock set in quickly. What a way to go. Perhaps the spirit of the waters have something agaisnt hubris?\n\nUnreal world is one of my favourite games of all time. Ignore the hour count on my steam profile I have a couple of hundred hours in the freeware version of this game. (I highly reccomend you play it if your on the fence, its exactly the same as the steam version just free). I ended up buying it on steam because I wanted to support the incredible developers of this game who have been working on it for 25 years. People might get turned off by its complexity but I can tell you, Unreal World has of the BEST tutorials I've ever seen in a game of its kind. Its immersive, unique setting of Iron age Finland is so well realised and steeped in mysticism and history you'll lose yourself in it. \n\nWhat the heck are you waiting for, go get mauled to death in the woods.

Incredibly good. I'll describe it to you quickly, since this is one of the many things that really made me mindblown.\n\nI started out with a Kaumo (There are cultures in the game), basically maxed out his fishing/spear skills and dropped myself near a lake on the east side of the map. I luckily spawned next to a fjord, a fishermans heaven. I started fishing and soon i was stocked for the upcoming 5 days. Used those days to explore for villages. When i came across the cabin of an old kaumo man, I sneaked behind the man and planted my spear in his rear-skull, stole his kota material (kota is a fur-tent) and his food. Then i wen't off to live near the fjord. After i put up my kota it was time to hunt some elk. I looked near my campsite for some elk, and found one. Mostly one elk means there COULD be a herd nearby so i wasted 3-4 days building a trap fence of 3 hexes. During this peroid, i was strongly convinced by the amount of traps that there was atleast a herd of 3+ elk nearby my trap fence. So, i waited for 2 days and my trap pit was filled. With only one elk. This elk made so much tracks that i really thought that there'd be a herd of 3+ elk. I was really annoyed, and just slitted the elks throat with my edge of my spear and let him bleed out to retrieve him the next day.\n\nNow for the finale, when i made my kota, i attracted the attention of a wonderful lynx. These critters are 9/10 times more afraid of you then you of them. Luckily this was the case. But this small lynx was too quick to catch so i instead i placed a trap pit and threw in some bait hoping he'd take it.\n\nHe did not, take the bait.\n\nI think he was maddened by the fact i underestimated him, so his time to take revenge was begun.\n\nThis fierce predator encircled my kota looking for a entrance to bite me to death while i was asleep. I woke up in the early morning with a thigh wound, then a gruesome hand wound, and then i found out the critter was finishing me off in my sleep! Quickly i grabbed my spear and tried to stab the c*nt but he quickly ran out my kota before i could do him any harm. After that, i feared for my life and crawled to the wooden cabin from the old kaumo man i murdered before. I literally slept next to the rotting carcass of this old man for 13 days straight. \n\nAfter that it was time to also slit the throat of this forest critter, i wen't back to my kota in the fjord (Still wounded) and camped the entrance of my kota. I knew that our little house cat saw me enter my kota. And then, two hours later he steps in the kota, sees me camping, and sisses at me and tries to leg it. I manage to hit him in the skull but it isn't enough and he books it into the woods. Fun fact the cat is still visiting me every day. And he just won't get trapped by all the trap pits i have laying around. He just memorises all the traps i have build and reminds himself not to go near that area.\n\nThe AI is wonderful in this game. This game deserves a 95/100\n\nI would only wish that keeping a good balance with the forest spirits was crucial, because it actually makes you fear the spirits. In earlier builds the forest spirits could actually call mythical creatures to kill you.

It's not overly hard, but the complexity and learning process will likely lead to a few untimely deaths.\n\nEvery single movement causes a slight passage in time. Take a step forward, time passes. Turn left or right, time passes. Activities, such as pulling brush off a tree, skinning an animal, filling a cup with water, or crafting some gloves brings up a progress bar while time passes automatically (with the option to stop mid-activity.) Doing something time consuming, such as building a wall for your shelter, generally takes some planning as you have to pay attention to your hunger/thirst/temperature/energy while doing so. Seems pretty standard, but when you're tracking some big game and the tracks converge on a heavily traffic area, turning left or right to look around means that animal gets further away.\n\nThe controls are somewhat confusing as there are key bindings for every activity. There's in-game help, but it might be more helpful to find a wiki that will list all actions in an easy to access format.

They been working on it since the 1990s, and I can't lie when I first tried it I loathed it, it was confusing and hard. Then I watched a few lets play learned the basics, and now I got 55 hours most of that just last week alone, as I only played for 30 mins the first time. The game is avalaible for free from the devs website, keep that in mind I didn't know that but I highly recomend if you play for free and like it buy it here to help the dev out.\n\nFirst off to note is realism is well real feeling, you can play this on a pc that doesn't even have a graphics card, its not very pretty. But its selling point is its like living in ironage finland to me its mountain man simulator. I got live off the land, there is no guns, raiding, dinosours, or even mounts of any kind. You biggest oppenet is starvation, well and bears, but in my expernince the preditors won't attack unprovoked although a hungry bear will from what I read, just like they can wonder into your settlement, climb fences and open doors making them the ultimate preditor in game, but I one I only ran into 3 times in 55 hours and never got mauled. Although my friend who just started a couple days ago got mauled on his first day playing by one lol.\n\nBut the way it works is intresting the seasons are set, but random you may get a warm spring, or long winter where its safe to walk on ice all the way to summer, and not be able to plane if that is your thing till mid summer. Or you can walk out on the ice on day one of spring start, that is normally still cold enough to do that then drown trying to get out of the whole you fell into.  In fact I died more to gambling with the ice then I have anything else. But that is the thing the risk vs reward I chased deer into the ice more then once, and crawled out on the thin ice on my belly while it tells me I hear the ice creeking to get that fat 200+ lbs of meat off it, plus its big heavy hide I could make mittens and cloak whatever I need to deal with cold. And you will fear the cold in your first winter if you are not ready you need more they just a simple shelter for the finish below zero winters.\n\nBut its not just that its the fact I kill a stag in a trap or whatever I get 200 lbs of mean I got lug back to my cabin or shelt to dry or smoke since no way I can keep eat all that before it rots even if I roast it over a campfire. I can trade it for tools, and what not in the NPC towns, or I can dry it with some simple cords I rip off my clothes or tear ups some furs or leathers I made and hange it off my shelter or cabin in spring or winter to dry for 40 days to let it last for 120 days, even more if I dig a cellar to store it in those 40 days it takes to dry. Its realistic to me, in other games you get a decent amount that you could live for a week off of, but in real life if you can preserve it a big stag or raindeer your eating for  months especially when you are not picky on what cuts you take with you. \n\nJust like I don't magically tan a hide, I got do a real life multi step proccess like clean it rip the bits of flesh and what not off the back, and rinse it in water, then I got do first step of using tanning agent normally fat I butchered off the kill is used, but I can use bark, then I got wait, then rinse that off, let it dry, then last step take it to a workstation or a simple log in the woods and beat it with a club to soften it up. All this veries a rabit hide I can proccess in a day more or less, but elk hide will take days to process. And I can defur it to make it into leather not a fur, that takes even longer like for elk hides an extra 10 plus days. But I can make leather armor I wear under or over my furs, a leather skin to store fluids like milk or water in, leather ropes I can use if I buy domestics as a leash. But over all furs are worth the most for trading.\n\n\nBut it just amazes me the more I play the more real it is, I mean solo making a 2x2 cabin with out the right tools takes weeks. In other game I could do a great big house in 2 weeks ingame in this I wear myself out and pass out from exhastion before I put together one peice of the log cabin wall. That is other thing there is right tool for every job so ther is no one tool to rule them all, you end up trading and stockpiling tools for everything you may not use often but life is so much better with it. Like a carving axe is good for well carving crafting a lot of things, but i need it to help shape logs for log cabin wall, but I also need a broad axe pretty much exclusvily for that as well. Like It will say when you cut your use two axes it will got \"hand ax is satisfactory for this task,\" twice since you need two axes but get jsut one of the right tool say carvign axe, you cut the build time down by a 1/3 you can now make one wall a day.\n\nAnd that is how all of it is hand axe is jack of all, but timber axes are better for logging, carving better for crafting spears and what not, just like a small knife trumps almost all other knifes minus hideworking where you want a broad knife to craft clothing or clean hides with. Just like a woodman axe for caving a steak isntead of a hand axe or a knife takes ages longer, great for cutting down the trees to get the slender logs for them but your better off carving with a small knife then using that big lumberjack axe to widdle stuff with.\n\nIts stuff like this that gets me hooked on it, add in winter is more harsh and we need skis to get around with one hand on a pole of some kind to cross country ski all over the map like its nothing. I mean once you get those and some skill your faster then ever before on land, and scoot across the thick ice as well, trade off is you need way more clothing to not die from cold, and there is way less to hunt in winter, but if your stocked up it makes perfect time of year to craft, and trade.\n\n\nOver all the game is crazy good survial game. I mean it lives up to the name quite well of survial. And its made by a real life guy, and think his pals up in finland who are nerds about this stuff their ancient Finish heritage, like the pics in game are rumored to be the dev and his freinds dressing up, and he really does go around in a pair of traditional style cross country skis, just like he owns replicas of old school finish bows, which he shoots for fun. Heck there is even a video of him and a pal making a log cabin wall to show how it was done and let realise why it takes so damn long for your low building skill guy to do it solo lol.\n\n\nOnly cons is has been in works for 25 years now and they don't do it for money it is free online at his website so its a little slow in devpment, Oh and the are doing a \"magic\" system but not fireballs and what not. The game is late ironage finland so they were very much pagans, and had a lot of myths, and rituals. Those are already in game you can learn rituals by being in tune with nature with some hidden stats we can't see, you can pray for better catches when fishing sacrafice meat from your first kill while hunting etc. Seems to increas or decrease your luck like certain ones for a fact temp boast stats for you, like the fishing one I noticed it ups my skill for next fishing attempt. And right now he is working more of that, as well as actaul avatar like people for the world map you may run into for these gods they believe in.

El personaje deber\u00e1 ser creado eligiendo su sexo, a qu\u00e9 tribu pertenece, y podemos subir algunas de sus habilidades. Teniendo en cuenta que dicho personaje cuenta con diversos atributos, un buen surtido de habilidades y unas cualidades en diversas armas y combate en general, y que estas var\u00edan en la creaci\u00f3n del personaje, varian durante la elecci\u00f3n de tribu, y var\u00edan al aumentar algunas,    hacen que cada personaje que creemos sea totalmente diferente a los anteriores y sea disestro para algunas tareas y torpe en muchas otras. Es humano, un humano corriente, y tiene muchas debilidades, cualquier cosa ah\u00ed fuera puede matarle. Adem\u00e1s elegiremos una peque\u00f1a historia de comienzo, la cual cambiar\u00e1 nuestro punto de partida y los objetos con los que comenzamos.\n\nEl juego en s\u00ed podriamos decir que se realiza en turnos, ya que si no realizas ninguna acci\u00f3n y no te mueves, el juego permanece inmovil. Cada acci\u00f3n permitir\u00e1 moverse a tu entorno y requerir\u00e1 de tiempo, que puede variar entre pocos minutos (rezar o hacer fuego) a varias horas (talar o pescar por ejemplo).

I've purchased this game 3 times now in one form or another and I don't regret the purchases one bit, the developer more than deserves the money for the time he's poured into this game.\n\nWhat a lot of roguelikes miss out on is having a balance of complexity, challenge and fun.  There are too many survival roguelikes that are an ocean wide but a puddle's depth, this is not one of them.  This game throws you right into the unforgiving wilderness and you're meant to survive right from the word \"go\".  Surviving isn't an easy task, food will be hard to come by, but when you actually successfully hunt wildlife you really feel accomplished because it's not black and white simple, more times than not you're going to have your target outrun or outsmart you, or even at times outfight you.  \n\nAll of your survival skills are stat-based, everything from building shelters, crafting traps, animal tracking, fishing, etc.  and the more you use them the more proficient you become in those skills.  Also beware of hostile creatures or Njerpez warriors roaming the wilderness that will make short work of you early-game.\n\nThere is lots of depth here with this game, almost complex at times, especially with the confusing sub-menus within the skills and far-from-optimal UI.  But with enough time you'll soon memorize what all they hotkeys are for each skill.\n\nThe game is absolutely unforgiving.  Your first few attempts at it expect hunger to be your biggest enemy, in which you'll need to figure out the best way you'd like to gather food.

I purchased several version licenses during this period prior to it being made available for free and now it's finally obtainable on Steam. I primarily purchased it here to support Sami and Erkka while also giving it a review. The game is still being updated regularly and it appears it'll continue doing so for the unforeseeable future. The developers have refined this piece with commitment and dedication for 25 years which is downright amazing.\n\n[h1]UnReal World[/h1]\nIt's a very slow paced game where one's choices has ramifications and over time you'll begin to feel an obligation to contemplate every decision you've made and intend to make as it could end up being the last for your character. The unfathomable depth of detail in this game makes it incredible for immersion. The fear of death greatly enhances this and the longer you survive, the greater the anxiety and dismay. Your character actions are based on realism, so consider wisely whether you should fight or flee when stumbling upon a pack of wolves or if you should risk your characters life hunting a bear for that well needed fat and calories for winter. I've always thought it's worth to progress in a sensible manner. Although as such, UnReal World does require a lot of your time. There's also quite a steep learning curve for the controls, but once you've adapted, you'll have it in your muscle memory and it'll become intuitive. The satisfaction you'll feel after setting yourself up to a task and finally completing it weeks later is monumental. While also making it heart breaking when you fail. This is a very difficult game for beginners and death is almost guaranteed. Even the most experienced players will have challenging moments that may end up with their characters dying. However, don't be deterred by the game having permanent player-character deaths. It adds so much to the game and the replay value is immense.

You need a good imagination and some patience to enjoy this game, and a bit of experience with older, clunkier games will help. I have to disagree with other users - I haven't found the game experience to be \"unfair\". Yes, sometimes an enemy will get a lucky shot and get you in the head with an arrow, and you'll die. Yes, it is hard to kill bears. Yes, you can work all winter to build a nice cabin, only to absent-mindedly fall through the thinning ice carrying too much gear and drown. In all of these cases, I felt that the challenge was fair, and I could recognize the mistakes I made that led to the death. I felt each death was meaningful and I learned a lot about the game each time, and I am still learning. \n\nOnce I got over the initial learning curve, this has easily been one of the best and most immersive experiences I've had with a game. I can't quite describe it, because it looks pretty underwhelming at a first glance, but there is some magic in this game if you are willing to hustle a bit for it. The game constantly challenges you to make tough decisions and manage your time carefully. My favorite part is the wound system - ripping off a piece of my fur cloak and dragging myself to a branch on the ground to splint my broken leg just feels perfect. The animal AI makes hunting a constant challenge, and the wide variety of traps, weapons, and hunting strategies keeps it fresh even hundreds of hours in. On top of that, it just has this indefinable charm - it's a loveable game.\n\nI can't recommend this game to impatient players or those looking for a \"smooth\" experience. Nor can I recommend it for those looking for a quick couple hours of fun. If you're like me and love simple looking games with unbelivable complexity under the hood, pick it up!\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1500266516, "timestamp_updated": 1500266516, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 32, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.773661", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33263050": {"recommendationid": "33263050", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034698929", "num_games_owned": 154, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 265, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2, "last_played": 1513527969}, "language": "english", "review": "I discovered Unreal World a while ago.

And there is so much to love about it. But 20 years of game development seems to have helped it little in the way on being fun for the player. I have played and enjoyed so many other rogue-like games such as Dwarf Fortress and Cataclysm DDA, so I'm fairly used to \"so unfair its fun,\" but often Unreal World seems unwilling to indulge the user in fun. \n\nCombat is infuriatingly unfair. It is not difficult, per se, rather, your opponent has unseen and unfun advantages. I can accept that a highly trained red cloaked barbarian can easily take down my peasant forester. I cannot accept that I can sneak up to the red cloak, hit him with three arrows, stab him multiple times with a spear, and then get one shot and die instantly. The dev believes the game to be balanced, as late game armor and weapons make fighting trivial. But early and mid game, fighting is deadly for you. The dev also claims that NPCs do not have any unfair advantage. Tell that to a bear I shot in the head, whose wounds was \"badly bleeding,\" and who was fading in and out of conscienceness (literally passed out twice), yet was able to run to me in one turn of combat, and proceed to kill me within 2 more turns.\n\n\"The world will surely teach one; if nothing else, than to walk slowly.\" Upon generation of a new character, you're greated with this Finnish proverb. And quickly, you realize how much the game wants you to act upon this proverb. The game is a slog. That may sound bad, but I love the thought of slowly working through a cold, rough game of Unreal World. I want to get to planting broad beans, crafting tonnes of trading goods, making friends with the locals, buying animals, and exploring the giant world. But at times, I find myself wanting something... more. Part of me wants to be self-sufficient in the world of Unreal World. It feels like it was meant to be so. Yet you are desperately tied to the small towns who are your only supply of metal tools and fishing nets (beside those you spawn with). Fustratingly, after 20 years of development, nets cannot be made, and the best tool you can create is stone. Salt, invaluable for curing food, must also be traded for. Seeds can either be spawned with, or traded for, but never found. All of these tie you to the town, which is fine, but limiting. \n\nI want to spawn in Unreal World, get lost in its woods, build a cabin, and create a life for my character all my own. In many ways, I want to lose myself to the Finnish woods. But instead, I find myself losing to bears that cannot be killed with head shots, enemies that can run faster then the flash (yet be \"crippled\") and controls that cause physical pain in my hands. Unreal World is so close to being a masterpiece, a true icon of video gaming. But I can't reccomend it without warning.

That's because it's free. It's been free on the internet for ages. Unreal World, developed by Sami Maaranen, and Erkka Lehmus, is a low fantasy roguelike set in Iron Age Finland. Of course, you know that from the description. To get to know this game, you need to immerse yourself in the world. And it's a big, complex world. URW has been updated regularly since its release in 1992. That's 25 years of frequent updates. The most recent version is 3.40, which just left alpha this year. I bought this game to support the devs, and it was worth every penny I paid for it. I'll do a quick rundown of pros and cons.\n\nPros: \n+Small game file - Since it's a simple roguelike, URW doesn't take up much space on your machine. You could probably run this on your 1990s IBM ThinkPad if you wanted to. \n+Better graphics than your average 1992 procedurally generated roguelike - Seeing as Sami has been updating the game for the past 25 years, it makes sense that it would look good. It's no Witcher, but it's better than Zork, or ASCII games.\n+Great skills system - Skills govern everything from weapon skills to dodging, skiing, sneaking, building, cooking, trapping, fishing, forestry, and agriculture.\n+Depth - The game is deep and complex. The game comes with its own encyclopedia (F1), and it's easy to sink hours upon hours into the game, discovering all the little secrets. For example, just yesterday I learned that sometimes, villagers who you help out will tell you the approximate location of buried treasure. That's better than 2 squirrel skins' worth of traded goods.\n+Rich world - The world is procedurally generated, but with geographic features like lakes, rivers, rapids, crossings, mountains, hills, seas, cliffs, and forests and swamplands of all kinds, you're unlikely to grow bored of your environment, or run out of space to explore (The game world is huge!) Each culture has its own spheres of influence surrounding their villages, where you will meet people of that culture. (Different cultures are good at different things. For example, the Koivulaiset are good farmers and trappers, but poor physicians and herbalists. They are handy with flails.) You can learn all of this stuff over time just by playing the game.\n+Seasons are awesome and add a great degree of \"Freshness\" to the game - Things are easy in the summer. Food is plentiful, and you can grow what you can't catch, hunt, or trap. It's easy to walk around, and you're in little danger of extreme temperatures. Winter is another story. If you haven't prepared for the long snows by the time the first flakes are falling, you may be doomed. The temperatures drop low enough to easily kill someone who doesn't have enough furs or shelter, the snow is so deep it slows you down and tires you out (Skiing is faster, and makes you less tired), and animals are rare. You probably won't stray far from your cabin. Winter really switches things up, and forces you to manage your time in the summer.\n+Mods add additional depth to the game - The game isn't perfect. Sami and Erkka are just two dudes, so they can't put everything they want in the game (Though they always have plans to add more content.) This is where mods come in. 3.40 is very new, so people might still be tweaking their old mods to fit this version, but I can let you know what I play with. Buiodda's Crafts (Which includes some of the mods of Rain, another amazing modder) adds ironworking, bowying, clayworking, and weaving (courtesy of Rain.), among other things. Budz Brewing adds beer and berry wine to the game (It has mead, but that may need another mod to work, because I haven't seen any bees or honey.), as well as barrels, which are great high-capacity containers. For a list of some of the mods, visit https://www.unrealworld.fi/wiki/index.php?title=Mods .\n+Just try it. - It's free! What do you have to lose? If you love the game, like I did, you might support the devs, so that they can keep working on this incredible project. Link to the official site below.\n\nhttp://www.unrealworld.fi/\n\nNegatives\n\n- Not easy - This isn't really a negative, but something which players should keep in mind. At least, it isn't easy to a disgusting casual like me. \n- I honestly sat here for quite a while trying to come up with something which I actually don't like about the game, and nothing came to mind. I don't know whether that reflects on URW as a game, or on me as a reviewer. \n\ntl;dr: Incredible game, great creators, great mods, just challenging enough, free from Sami's website, please pay him on Steam if you like it.

I've spent more time with the game, gotten used to the controlls and realized that my initial run was just incredibly unlucky.

If, after understanding how it works, you like it, you can give the author money. There's really no way to go wrong with this approach, and no excuse for me not to recommend this great game, which the author is willing to let you have for free!\n\n\nMY OLD REVIEW:\nWhat a shame to have to leave a negative reveiw for this. It should've been the best game ever. A tribal-ear survival game with minimalistic graphics and over 25 years in development, with great depth accumulated over time? Yes, please! I really wanted this game to work out and was willing to forgive it a lot, but it just fell flat on its face because, apparently, it looks like in those 25 years nobody bothered to put any time whatsoever into a more intuitive and convenient UI or just improve the gameplay experience in general, other than adding more to the game's amazing depth. \n\nIt started out with technical issues right off the bat. It took over 2 hours of research, manually installing VC++ distributables  of various versions to even get this game to run (apparently if anything goes wrong during the game's original distributable installation, it never tries to install them again and just crashes on every start without giving you any errors; not even deleting all game files and redownloading/reinstalling fixes the issue).\n\nHaving gotten past the technical stuff, I was excited to play. To say the user interface is clunky is to say nothing. You can do almost nothing with the mouse and menus. You're supposed to remember all the key shortcuts in order to play this. Want to drop something? Can't just go into inventory and drop what you see from there like a normal game would. You have to press \"d\" on your keyboard, then mark the item(s) in the resulting drop menu with \"ENTER\" and then when you are done selecting press \"SPACE\". Want to craft something? Press \"s\" for skills. Want to put on your mittens because they game tells you your hands are getting cold? Press \"W\". Pay attention, that's upper case W, because lower case w is reserved for selecting your weapons. The only way it could get worse is if you had to type in action words a-la 1985 games.\n\nThe game does a poor job of informing you of what's happening and stopping time accelleration, leading to unfriendly outcomes. The tutorial guided me through felling a tree and building a fire and, after giving me a fresh pike, asked me to cook it. The pike will be cooking for a few hours, it said, so why don't you go try crafting something? OK, I went to the felled tree, selected the woodworking menu, and tried to make some boards. No indication how long it will take, time accelleration kicks in. Three times through the process a bird flies over, and the game helpfully asks if I want to stop what I'm doing. Well, no, I have no bow and so no way to interact with it, so I keep going. Then, in very quick succession and with no indication other than pale text in the game log, I get hungry, the pike starts to smell like it's burning. I frantically cancel the action manually and go pick up the pike. It hasn't burned, but it has spoiled. How on Earth does a fresh fish spoil in the middle of grilling?! Whatever, let's eat some food we started with instead and go finish those boards. Time accelleration starts again until without any warning you collapse and eventually sleep. Wake up in the morning with fully depleted hunger and bar, and a red state of \"malnourished\" barely able to get up. This, after eating full the night before, right after the game tutorial told me I can go without food for a couple of weeks. Thirst, which the game warned about was critical, didn't even rise past half in all this time.\n\nNow, I'm willing to put up with a ceratin level of junky UI and buggy mechanics from a game I like, but let's also not forget that this is a rogue-like. A bug or a dumb outdated UI decision can be the undoing of your character. As somebody on the forum wrote, they spent months building a house, then built a fire close to it and it just burnt down, leading them to rage-quit and abandon the game for a while. I can see stuff like that happening a lot in this game.\n\nNow, it's undeniable that the game has a loyal following, so there must be a way to get past all this stuff and see into the good sides of the game if you invest enough time and effort, but in the time I got while still being able to refund, all I saw was a buggy, poorly designed and unplayable mess that belongs in the '90s where it crawled out from.", "timestamp_created": 1497107253, "timestamp_updated": 1497173758, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 50, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.777131", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32228026": {"recommendationid": "32228026", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042238722", "num_games_owned": 175, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1872, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496787629}, "language": "english", "review": "I am mad. Sure, this game is good - sort of. I enjoy playing it, and have spent many hours playing it, but there are a few glaring issues which still make me so horribly upset that I cannot write a positive review.\n\nThe first, and foremost issue, is combat. In a sentence: Wow, it sucks really badly.\n\nLet me be clear: the system itself for combat is quite cool! It uses body parts, different attack types, bleeding, various injuries... It's extensive, and very fun! In theory. In truth, trying to fight literally ANYTHING that isn't completely subdued in a trap is as fluid and balanced as Niagra Falls - which is to say, not at all. Unless you get a lucky strike early on in a fight, you are doomed to die as the AI lands nearly every attack (with at least glancing blows) and will eventually kill you or knock you out, whereupon you also die OR lose all your stuff. Let me give you a recent example. I made a character, high stats all around, good Strength and Endurance and Speed and Agility, good Sword, Spear, and Block skill, and chose the Bandits! start. I began with a Broadsword, which was brilliant! I waited, baited the bandits to a bottleneck in the trees, and combat began.\n\nOnly two attacks in and I had landed a solid blow on his neck with my broadsword. 'Huzzah!', I thought, assuming that would be the end of him - except, he kept attacking me. Yes, you heard that right - a man whose throat had been slashed (not a glancing hit mind you, a 'solid strike' with the Edge) by a SWORD continued beating me with his stick. He then conked me on the head with what is the equivalent of a god-damn mother fucking BRANCH and I was instantly unconscious. He took all my things and left me for dead in the wilderness.\n\nWhat?! Are you kidding me? And that's not the first time! I have been MASTER level upon character creation with weapons, been given said weapons, and then tossed into the fray only to die to the first combatant I encounter (Human or Animal, it matters little to this worthlessly lopsided combat system) and be forced to re-start. I barely land any hits that are more than mere grazes unless the person is previously completely incapacitated, and even when I do they miraculously shrug off serious injuries or the fear of death and beat me like a punching bag. It's horrendous.\n\nThis is the main issue with this game, in my opinion - and with it being the only way to ever gain new items without literal in-game weeks or even months of grinding (hello, Craft Wooden Bowl option!) or what essentially boils down to RNG (here's lookin' at you, Trapping and Hideworking! Better hope you can find 12 OTHER Bear Hides that aren't Ragged or Harsh!), it's horrid. It's like soggy porridge laced with gravel, scumming up what would be a fine brunch otherwise. \n\nTl;DR? Combat sucks because the AI hits almost everything and despite your skills and stats you are a bump on the log.\n\nAnd don't even get me STARTED on how crass the food spoilage is. Yes, food spoils, this is true and by no means do I mean it should be removed. But, unless you are a hunting or trapping G O D, fishing is the only sustainable way to stay alive and gain food in the entire game, since Smoking, Drying, and Salting are arbitrarily hard and un-doable until certain requirements are met (Smoking requires you to have built a home or use an already-built home in a village, which is wildly inconvenient, Drying requires it to be WINTER SPECIFICALLY, and Salting means you need to trade the Driik (( yes only one tribe can provide salt )) and they charge you like it's their god-damn lifeblood). This leads to a life spent almost always with the 'I want to be a Fisherman' start, as to guarantee a Fishing Rod, as even large take downs like Elk and Bears will still spoil in a few days regardless of how quickly you eat. And once that's gone, well, good luck finding more, you poor sod!\n\nUpdate: As I was writing this, I tried again on the combat thing. After landing two hits to the head (one even being a 'perfectly executed thrust to his skull!') of an enemy, I proceeded to never hit him again for literally 30 turns of combat as all my weapons broke in quick succession, he never died or fell unconscious from blood loss as getting a SPEAR TO THE HEAD WOULD DO, and I died. And then, after trying AGAIN, I missed an attack on an Unconscious opponent.

Don't even bother.\n\nThe old school graphics are cool and all, and the basic idea should in theory work, but you need to do eveyrthing a certain way in a certain order never told to you or you will die. For instance fishing leads to starvation as it will never provide enough food to cover the hunger while you are fishing, also you need bow and arrow ASAP, because contrary to what the game tells you, you neither sneak up on animals or run them down, everything from the biggest to the smallest animal can outrun a human and none of them have lairs or places they return to, so they can run thousands of miles, and even with 100/100 in sneak, you can not go 5 feat without trigger the animal to run away.\n\nFunniest thing you can do in the game is try to climb trees. It is SAFEST if you have a low stat, because you will fall down from the tree 99/100 times, and the higher your skill in climbing is, the higher you get before you fall down.

Sure, the graphics are dated and controls might feel overwhelming in the beginning, but behind the first impressions hides a truly spectacular survival experience in the forests of Iron Age Finland.\n\nUnreal World utilises the mechanics that 2D world offers over 3D to give the player more realistic survival setting. 2D world can speed up the world around you when you perform tasks much more naturally than any game done in 3D could, and the game takes full advantage of this. The days in UrW are 24h, the year is 365 days. When you plant crops they aren't full grown in the next morning. There's also full 4 seasons in a Finnish year. During summer it's warm and the nature is blooming, but after a few months of sunshine it starts to get cold. And it gets really cold. If you are not prepared the winter can freeze you to death in a day and roaming in waist deep snow is exhausting. But even winter has its benefits. Animal tracks are easier to spot in the snow and food lasts for months before it spoils when it's -20c outside 24/7.\n\nAnimals in the Unreal World are dangerous, but not like in many other games where you'll be beating them off multiple times a day with your fancy swords. In Unreal World even the most dangerous animals, the bears will flee when they spot you 90% of the time, perhaps even more often. They might get curious, smelling your roasting food and stay nearby. Come night they might try to sneak in and steal your food. Specially foxes like to do that. Or they might eat your livestock if you have any. But most of the time they will attack you only after you have provoked them by chasing them, cornering them or by surprising them, sneaking too close. Almost any animal will attack you when cornered, an elk might kick you to the head if you give it no chance to escape.\n\nCombat is terrifying. Any time you are attacked there's always a real chance your game will end there. This might sound like a bad game design choice. But in my opinion it makes much more sense this way. The player is not a super-human who could beat of 10 other people with ease. And if you lose in combat you will not wake up in your bed the next morning or something like that. You will be staring at the summary screen of your characters life, that has ended. Some special cases might leave you alive after you lose a battle, the robbers and friendly villagers. Robbers will take all your valuables and villagers will take away stolen property by force if you try to steal from them.\n\nUnreal World is the most complete survival experience I have come across, ever. And the best thing is that the author still has ideas of what to add, even if the pace might not be the fastest.\n\nHere's a few ways to end your life sooner rather than later in Unreal World, try to avoid:\n-Throwing a rock at a bear when you are not prepared for battle.\n-Walking on thin ice in the spring.\n-Swimming with all your stuff\n-Fishing with poor skill or poor tools\n-Eating funny looking mushrooms or plants.", "timestamp_created": 1489664839, "timestamp_updated": 1489664839, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518209", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30472479": {"recommendationid": "30472479", "author": {"steamid": "76561198114658695", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 15583, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512857781}, "language": "schinese", "review": "3.40\u6253\u730e\u771f\u7684\u975e\u5e38\u96be\uff0c3.18\u62ff\u7740\u5927\u68d2\u5b50\u8ffd\u7740\u730e\u7269\u51e0\u4e2a\u56fe\u5c31\u80fd\u66f4\u4e0a\u5e76\u6253\u6b7b\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u66f4\u65b0\u68ee\u6797\u592a\u591a\u592a\u8302\u5bc6\u4e86\uff0c\u6bcf\u6b21\u8ffd\u730e\u7269\u8fdb\u4e86\u6811\u6797\u5c31\u50bb\u773c\u4e86\uff0c\u6811\u592a\u591a\u4e86\uff0c\u60f3\u8981\u627e\u730e\u7269\u8db3\u8ff9\u5fc5\u987b\u628a\u89c6\u91ce\u653e\u5230\u6700\u5c0f\u7a0b\u5ea6\u624d\u80fd\u5728\u6811\u6797\u91cc\u770b\u4eb2\u8db3\u8ff9\uff0c\u4e0d\u80fd\u53d1\u89c6\u91ce\u8c03\u5230\u6700\u5927\uff0c\u89c6\u754c\u592a\u5c0f\u4e86\uff0c\u538b\u6839\u6ca1\u6cd5\u76ef\u7740\u730e\u7269\u5f80\u54ea\u4e2a\u65b9\u5411\u8dd1\uff0c\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u8bdd\u5728\u68ee\u6797\u91cc\u8db3\u8ff9\u5f88\u5feb\u5c31\u8ffd\u4e71\u4e86\uff0c\u5f88\u75db\u82e6\uff0c\u65b0\u7248\u672c\u6211\u5c45\u7136\u6ca1\u6709\u6253\u6b7b\u4e00\u53ea\u5927\u578b\u730e\u7269   \u603b\u4e4b\uff0c\u6e38\u620f\u662f\u4e2a\u597d\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u6709\u54ea\u4e2a\u5927\u795e\u80fd\u6559\u6211\u4e00\u4e0b\u65b0\u7248\u672c\u600e\u4e48\u6253\u730e\u7684\uff0c\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u7248\u672c\u6211\u6253\u730e\u90fd\u4e0d\u7528\u8fdc\u7a0b\u6b66\u5668\u7684\uff0c\u5168\u9760\u4e00\u53cc\u811a\u8dd1\u7136\u540e\u4e0a\u6b21\u7ed3\u679c\u75b2\u52b3\u7684\u52a8\u7269\uff0c\u73b0\u5728\u7684\u8bdd\u57fa\u672c\u4e0a\u9760\u811a\u662f\u6781\u96be\u8ffd\u4e0a\u730e\u7269\u4e86\uff0c\u6811\u6797\u592aTM\u7684\u8302\u5bc6\u4e86\uff0c\u592a\u8302\u5bc6\u4e86\uff0c\u592a\u8302\u5bc6\u4e86\u3002      \u5f53\u7136\uff0c\u8981\u662f\u80fd\u6709\u5b98\u65b9\u6c49\u5316\u5c31\u66f4\u5b8c\u7f8e\u4e86\uff0c\u597d\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u6709\u6700\u65b0\u7248\u7684\u5b98\u65b9\u6c49\u5316\u7684\u8bdd\u6587\u5b57\u573a\u666f\u5c31\u80fd\u770b\u5f97\u8ddf\u6e05\u695a\u4e86\uff0c\u5168\u82f1\u6587\u7684\u53ea\u80fd\u8fb9\u73a9\u8fb9\u67e5\uff0c\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u5355\u8bcd\u8fd8\u597d\uff0c\u590d\u6742\u6216\u8005\u751f\u50fb\u4e00\u70b9\u7684\u5355\u8bcd\u5c31\u5f97\u53bb\u82f1\u6c49\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e86\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u6b66\u5668\u540d\u548c\u52a8\u7269\u540d\u3002\u3002\u3002\u7ed9\u4e2a\u8d5e\uff0c\u563f\u563f\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u6709\u5f88\u591a\u7684\u4eba\u5173\u6ce8\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u8bdd\u8bf4\u4e0d\u5b9a\u5c31\u6709\u5927\u624b\u6765\u641e\u65b0\u7248\u672c\u7684\u6c49\u5316\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e86\u3002\u3002\u3002\u563f\u563f", "timestamp_created": 1489330564, "timestamp_updated": 1489330564, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.676617", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30378548": {"recommendationid": "30378548", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022454933", "num_games_owned": 501, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 4783, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 135, "last_played": 1514189922}, "language": "english", "review": "Best realistic roguelike survival game ever made.", "timestamp_created": 1488915929, "timestamp_updated": 1488915929, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509251", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30366456": {"recommendationid": "30366456", "author": {"steamid": "76561198089818381", "num_games_owned": 472, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 555, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497288519}, "language": "english", "review": "If you enjoy inmersive roleplaying within a game, and making up your own story, and letting your imagination take over in place of visuals then this game is for you.  However, if you need animations on screen, rigid questlines, and giant battles then you will not enjoy Unreal World.  It plays very close to the adventure mode in dwarf fortress (just not with ascii graphics) and Im sure some inspiration definately came from dwarf fortress.  \n\nWhen starting the game you create a character through stats and choosing a tribe/ cultural group.  If you explore the help manual with the f1 key then you can find some more information about each tribe.  One thing I really enjoyed was that most of the native tribes (the northern tribes) aren't especially fond of warfare, but are very much in touch with the land and the spirits.\n\nAfter creating your character you get to pick your starting \"story\" which is thr scenario your character will start in.  Most of the time I end up using the unfortunate hunting trip scenario, very revenant like, but I did not survive being mauled by the bear.\n\nWhat Unreal World lacks visually it makes up for in depth.  The survival mechanics are managable, but it is too possible to not realize that you hadn't packed enough food to last a migration south to warmer climates for the winter.  Also, combat is much more unforgiving (just as it is in dwarf fortress (can you see a theme yet?)) And what seemed like an easy fight can go wrong with a lucky blow to the leg.  The hunting system is my favorite by far!  Tracking, stalking, mix and repeat.  Very realistic, and Im speaking from experience as a hunter myself.  In other games you go look for an animal, you shoot it, and you have enough food for a little while.  Unreal World makes you earn it.  So you found an elk, got close enough for a shot with your bow?  Great, you have mortally wounded it, but it still ran away.  So you will spend the rest of the in game day following blood trails and tracks, and hopefully you find it again.\n\nIf you do not enjoy creating your own experience in a game then Unreal World is not for you!

There's a lot of negatives when compared to similar games.  But I have to give it a positive review for being so original, especially considering the time in which it was conceived.  My biggest gripe is that for a game that's been in development for about 30 years, there's surprisingly little content when compared to other survival titles that are flashier and prettier to look at.  The development is absolutely glacial in pace (puns, heh...).  Released to Steam in Feb 2016 and it's received only 1 sizeable update if I remember correctly.

Now, however, I can leave a review!\n\nSo, this game won't be for everyone. I can gush about it for hours, but it's important that you understand that if [i]I[/i] like it, that doesn't have to mean [i]you[/i] will. That's why I will start outlining the things that may make this game not fit for everyone.\n\n[h1]Cons:[/h1]\n\n[list]\n[*]The graphics are simple and have little merit to them. They're merely there to make the game accessible. If you have a problem with simple graphics, this game is not for you.\n[*]The controls are not very good. Once again, they're just there in order to be able to control the game, and to play this you'll have to remember or look up a bunch of key combinations. Luckily, you can do this in-game. This'll become muscle memory after a while, but if you're starting out it can be quite difficult.\n[*]The game has no difficulty curve. There is one difficulty, and while you have the merit of starting out with some useful stuff and you can delay winter by starting early in the year, you're going to have to learn how to deal with the game's challenges. And this game can be hard, especially if you're not sure what to do.\n[*]The game can be a grind. You have to focus on both the long term and the short term, which often means you'll have to do the same thing for weeks on end in an effort to reach some long term goal, and especially early on you'll be restricted when you're just beginning to make a living for yourself.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Pros:[/h1]\n\n[list]\n[*]This game has great depth. While it's certainly possible to understand the game mechanics, there are always things that will surprise you are possible. As an example, I once got knocked in the eye while climbing a tree, and I was astounded that my field of vision was actually decreased by this.\n[*]The game world is huge. It's not endless, but there is plenty of room to do anything you wish.\n[*]There are a lot of interesting skills, and they're not trivial to master. From weatherlore to timbercraft to tracking, there's plenty of skills to spend your time refining and reap the benefits from.\n[*]There's a lot of things you can build and do. You could become a carpenter who sells their crafts for food, or a hunter, who is self-sustaining but has to travel a lot. Each option is interesting and provides you with a new style of play, needing to focus on different things to be successful.\n[*]Realism. Harsh realism. This game is not forgiving, and a single mistake can lead to a series of events that ends with you dying alone in a pit surrounded by wolves. There are of course limits to this, but a few of the things you will need to keep an eye on during your travels are temperature, thirst, nutrition, carrying capacity, wounds, disposition with the locals, time of year, state of your clothes, and quality of your tools and items.\n[/list]\n\nIn the end, there's just a lot you can do in this game, and it's great to see your plans come together as you slowly build up resources, self-sufficiency, and social contacts among the locals.\nThe price of 10,99 is great, and the amount of content you'll get is certainly worth that price.\nThis game sets out to place you, on your own, in a harsh, wild land in the ancient North, and it captures that feel well. You'll often be struggling to survive, cold, undernourished, or low on supplies, with no traces of civilization for miles around.\nThis game is not for everyone, but if you've made it this far into

It's brilliant, realistic and the longest still supported game in history. \n\nThe graphics is probably one thing that hold people back from buying it. But don't let the simple graphics fool you. Underneath it's a very advanced simulator and you quickly forget about it and you might even think the graphics are good after a while.\n\nThe sound is what's happening in the game world, you hear an owl? There is an owl close by which you can hunt. You hear a wolf? Make sure your sheep is brought inside for the night or you could wake up by the sound of grawls and bleats.

There's barely no hand holding at all, no easier modes, just you and nature, and those warriors that kill you everytime. As a person who love RougeLikes and Survival games this hits me with love.

It introduces tasks in the wrong sequence and doesn't let you work on the relevant task until you finish the preceding task.\n\nFor example to build a fire you need to chop down a tree but you can't do the task for chopping down a tree until you build a fire.  Once you build the fire you need to chop down another tree to complete the chopping down a tree tutorial.\n\nIt eventually tells you to catch a fish but every body of water I can find says that there are no fish available.  I can't sleep because it's constantly raining so I'm crawling around trying to find somewhere I can catch a fish so I can move on to how to build a shelter.\n\nTutorials should not be an exercise in frustration like the tutorial for this game is.  If the developers don't want to fix the sequence of events for the tutorial at the minimum they should allow the player to view all tutorial options and give credit as they are completed.\n\nIt appears that fish is a poor choice of first food types because it is so dependent on finding somewhere that the game will allow you to fish that you end up starving to death trying to find somewhere to get food.\n\nWhile the game might get better as you get more familiar with how it works (my second game was less frustrating then my first game) there is a limited refund window on Steam and as poorly as the game is currently playing I don't want to exceed that window it in hopes that the game gets better.", "timestamp_created": 1475948856, "timestamp_updated": 1477014541, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25570913": {"recommendationid": "25570913", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065481512", "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 366, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474303979}, "language": "english", "review": "So far I am loving this game.

You can do almost anything in the game that you want and the sheer size of the simulation and procedural generation is crazy. Every map is full randomly generated, although certain factions will always inhabit particular areas as that is part of the game's history. (Thereis a full in-game encyclopedia to tell you about just about everything, from were each of the 9 dominant tribes live, how they live, and what tools and skills the use in their daily life) \n\nThe creators have updated the game for a very very long time and are consistent, I remember stumbling on this accidentally like 10 years ago on their webpage and thought it was awesome. They mix in real pictures to simulate many of the events in the game and locations and if you look past the basic spriting, its a game that shines. The soundtrack is great and the theme song is played on a Kantele, which is apparently a Finnish instrument. They use a lot of their heritage in the game as it is based in the real world with Finnish mythological stuff thrown on top (but mostly in the form of rituals). You can hunt, fish, trade, fight, build, go bear grylls in Iron Age Finland, basically whatever you choose. \n\nAlthough it is not a super easy game in the beginning, it is rewarding once you figure out the controls and your basics. There are guides available online too that make it easier to start, or just figure it out by trial and error and look through your list of ancestors. It's not that expensive and you'll get more time out of it than AAA titles, except maybe Witcher 3, because damn that is a good, solid game.

Amazing depth - food can give you food poisoning, wounds can kill you slowly if not treated properly, you can freeze, and the bear can kill you with one hit. It is as unforgiving as it is deep.\n2. Really immersive - I love the setting, with all those lovely forests and lakes, wise sages, a touch of magic, and never knowing what might hide behind the corner and kill you, if you're careless.\n3. Crafting - you can craft many items, build your own home, and given how long it takes, it really feels like a reward.\n4. Great developers who keep adding new things and make the game even greater. \n5. Very detailed system of clothing and how it shields you not only from the enemy, but also from cold. \n6. Hunting is really challenging and rewarding.\n7. Trapping is fun.\n8. Mushrooms that can kill you slowly. Seriously. This game is that unforgiving. \n\nCons:\n1.

But there are some minor things that is just bad game design and it takes away a bit of enjoyment from the game. \n\nFor example tracking. Normally when you walk through the woods you notice tracks of animals here and there. Some pine cones eaten by a bird, or a squirrel, or a mouse. Some droppings of a hare, or a fox. Now and then some tracks. Even an idiot can clearly see these signs of animals moving about a forest, even though an idiot may not recognize what animal left that tracks. In this game, I'm playing a max intelligence character with 40% tracking skill and after walking over half the map he didn't spot a single track anywhere. What's more, walking through the woods is not enough, I have to activate a skill EVERY STEP OF THE WAY. Come on. It's just tedious and not the least bit of fun. Just make it a toggle to track, which means pay more attention to the ground, and let movement cost slightly more or something. \n\nThe crafting interface is also a bit clunky. I have a pile of timber and planks and twigs on the ground, but if it's not in my inventory I can't build anything, and I can't pick it up because I'm not strong enough. Like, wait, that's not how you build a house... Builders don't carry EVERYTHING THEY NEED for the house, they just go get one plank at a time. If it's in the adjacent squares, that should be enough.\n\nAnd so on. But it is an enjoyable game. Just a bit surprising that it was developed for decades and still simple things to fix like what I mentioned are still in the game.", "timestamp_created": 1472999640, "timestamp_updated": 1472999640, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500042", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25338144": {"recommendationid": "25338144", "author": {"steamid": "76561197974847754", "num_games_owned": 151, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 5725, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 140, "last_played": 1514002413}, "language": "english", "review": "UnReal World is a wilderness survival game set in iron age Finland.

Don't let the hours here fool you, I've put hundreds (maybe thousands) of hours into this game long before it got onto Steam. The game is fantastically replayable, which is good as you will be replaying it a lot when your characters die, over and over. \n\nI would not describe the game as brutal, since there are some starting scenarios that actually set you up quite well if you just want to get to a point where you're stable and can focus on building a house, crafting, and trading. But the game IS unforgiving. No matter how well equipped you are, you'll need to think twice about taking on a Njerpez warrior (even alone) or going after that bear you see across the marsh. One missed swing or shot by you and one solid hit from your opponent (especially if that opponent is a bear) can end you all at once. Or maybe just give you a little scratch that you can tend to while you're sorting through loot or tanning a bear hide to make yourself a nice winter coat. That unpredictability that faces all violent interactions within the game can put some players off, but is a huge draw to others like myself. And if you're looking at a game like this, you're probably one of those kinda of players anyway!\n\nWhile the game has tons of content and an absolutely enormous, randomly generated world to play in, the one downside is that it suffers from something of a \"late game\" drag. I hate late game in the context of Unreal World since you can play for as long as you can keep your character alive, but when you've survived one full year and you're comfortable enough to sit for days on end at your homestead crafting or resting and not have to worry about feeding or clothing yourself, you'll know you've arrived at the \"late game\". However, once better interaction mechanics are implemented with NPC communities (something that is in the pipeline), this period will be vastly improved. In the meantime, what most players seem to do is pick harder scenarios, pack up and move, go on a really long expedition, or start taking on riskier endeavors (such as aforementioned bear hunting and Njerpez fighting.

Why play games like Pokemon or UnReal World only to avoid a majority of the content--lest you make it too easy for yourself--instead of just playing a game that's inherently difficult? There's other RPG's out there where you'll actually be challenged just by playing the game normally and utilizing all materials and tactics.

But honestly in retrospect, I really only struggled with it due to my not knowing how to distribute my time spent on various tasks. You'll lose characters to this confusion. Do not misinterpret this as challenge, it is only the overwhelming amount of skills and ways to gather food that are leading you to death. You'll grasp it all soon and realize it's mathematical boredom. Nothing will intimidate you. You'll have so much food you'll have to throw it away to make room for more food. I had one character with 400 pounds of food in a cellar and I didn't even bother removing it when it all spoiled. \n\nIf in future updates they change it so that I'm no longer a walking meat grinder who sucks the life out of anything that moves as soon as it enters range, I would very much enjoy playing. One suggestion I have is to make there be 500% less settlements spawning. If there were only one or two within reasonable walking distance of the player, maybe I'd value them enough to not slaughter their sages and steal their livestock. This would probably be easier to implement than tampering with damage multipliers and everything else it takes to nerf or boost characters. \n\nI still recmmend the game despite writing nothing but complaints because it took me 70 hours to realize how depthless it all really is. The game maintained this facade that kept me fearful and thinking I was some chess master when I'd succeed in kills. It wasn't till I decimiated my 50th village that I realized \"wait a minute. absolutely nothing is a threat to me, even when i'm practically naked and using only a handaxe\".\nAlso, I respect the developer despite my major disagreements with some of his methods. You are living the dream, and I think you're a swell guy.\nSo, yeah. 10 bucks for 70 hours of fun? I don't regret this purchase in the slightest, though clearly I had expected this to be years of fun like other, better roguelikes (...that are all free.

It is a rogue-like. Starting from sticks & stones, build and trade whatever you need to survive the unforgiving Northern Europe. There are no classes, levels, hitpoints... just you, your survival skills, knowledge and pure nature as far as eye can see, and quite a bit more after that.\n\n[h1]Gameplay Highlights[/h1]\n[list]\n  [*] It is turn based, it is played by mostly keyboard, but some actions are simplified with a mouse.\n  [*] You can choose tribes for various initial bonusses to skills, and starting items, then use skills to train and develop them.\n  [*] There are no limitations based on skills or item quality (although tasks require specific types of items). The end result, and how long it takes to get there varies by skills and item quality.\n  [*] Damage modelled as wounds inflicted on specific body parts, and blood loss. \n  [*] Hunger and thirst are fairly realistic, in fact this game has the most realistic hunger and thirst simulation I've ever seen.\n  [*] Objects and actions behave as expected. Recipes make sense. There are no mysterious crafting recipes like \"wood + rock = hand gun\"\n  [*] The game is difficult. It will take a while to survive beyond the first week, it may even take a few tries to get to that point. Oh, and there are no guard rails. You can die within the first day.\n  [*] Some items, including some common items, cannot be crafted, and must be traded for.

They roam through the land, depending on the season, the terrain, spirits' favour and chance.

Dont know a mushroom because your herblore skill is too low? better dont eat it, you might get sick and die. Thank the spirits, there are also plants that help your body in a variaty of ways, some ease fever and help you getting rid of toxins. Or ease that flu you got after sleeping in the rain. Better know some. winter time? no plants for you then, except maybe some cloudberries that ripen extremely late in the year.\n\ncoolest crafting system i know. Want to smoke your meat because you cant eat the whole elk before it spoils? Well, you need a smoking hut. fell some trees, big ones. Make logs from the trunks, build walls. split some trunks into boards, make a door. get smaller trees and boards for the roof. a window, if you are fancy. For each step you need an axe. while it is possible to fell trees with a flimsy stone-axe, you better have some nice big axe (different axes are ideal for different work) or this will take a while...\n collect a whole bunch of stones to build a stove. get firewood and smoke it up. dont forget some tying equipment to hang the meat from the roof (craftable from clothes or hides). And then the meat will taste terrible because your cooking skill is too low =) \n\nA Bear mauled you? well this game has the most complex system of injuries i have ever seen in a game. if he just broke some ribs, lucky you. Maybe your legs are total waste and you cant stand up. good luck hunting now, you better have some emergency food stache to last you until everything is healed. Got a nice warm bear fur coat? good for you, but without gloves you'll get frostbite on your hands in winter. Better make a fire and warm yourself up regularly. You met a raider with a cuirass and your weapon is rather flimsy? aim for the legs and run! more than a dozen different zones of your body can get injured with different effects an armor parts realistically cover different parts. Different materials protect differently against point (e.g. spear, arrows), blade(sword), impact (club, reindeer hooves) damage and cold. bleeding is seperately discounted for. better have a bandage or you will bleed out, good if you know the blood staunching prayer.\n\nawesome game and great support, too! for example there used to be a rare issue with the game not starting up on ubuntu. posted on the forum, the developer replied quickly and fixed it.

So one fateful day I stumble upon this masterpeice of a game. \n\nI fell in love with the hardships I faced and the small victories I could claw from the grasp of mother nature. But I admit I got frustrated when I got so far and lost it all due to a silly mistake, then I learned the incredible art of BACKUP SAVES!

Before I knew it I was slightly interested. \n\nMy slight interest and curiosity got me to download the free version of this game and give it a good college try. After about an hour I knew this was something special. Something I could play for years if not for once in a while. \n\nYou are in control of a tribesmen or women of sorts set to survive in the great iron north. You can customize your starting story which impacts your starting gear and situation respectively. You can also customize where you start and whether the tutorial is active or not. From there is up to you create a marvelous adventure filled with peril, exhaustion, starvation, infection, and whatever else might kill you. \n\nThe game mechanics make sense and feel realistic. Chopping a tree down with a knife takes hours unlike using an axe, chasing down a reindeer or badger is unlikely, etc. It\u2019s not perfect but it works. \n\nThis game kind of reminds me of a \u2018create your own adventure book/board game\u2019. Time progresses as you perform actions and move around the world. This gives you time to think about your next action. Do you try and sneak up on that wild pig or do you chunk this rock on the ground at it? Knowing that if you miss it\u2019s probably going to get away. Should I eat this spoiled food knowing it might make me sick? \n\nDeath is permanent so make every choice count! \n\nEvery action performed is checked against multiple stats. Reminds me of the old DnD days. Makes the world feel more immersive and the combat feel richer. You want to throw that spear? How fatigued are you? What\u2019s you skill in spears? Are you injured? How far away is the target? I don\u2019t know all the exact stats but I know there is a lot going on in the background for everything you do. \n\nI recommend that you just watch a couple video and try it out for yourself. Download the free version at their website.\n If this sounds good to you then you owe it to yourself to give it a good college try like I did. \n\nI will leave you with a brief adventure that I had in the Unreal World\u2026 \n\nAlone, cold, and starving I come across a lonely reindeer in the middle of a vast frozen forest. He doesn\u2019t notice me so make a slow approach. As I approach I snap a small branch beneath my foot like an idiot which alerts the reindeer to jump to attention. It\u2019s now or never. I draw and shoot my bow. The shot is steady and accurate but the reindeer is already in motion. The arrow penetrates just below the reindeer\u2019s shoulder. It takes off into the dense woods. I follow. After a short while I start to lose sight of it and I am relying on my tracking ability alone. Tracks and blood keep me focused. As night beings to fall I start to loose site of its trail. It\u2019s getting dark and I am starting to lose hope. My stomach growls and I begin to shiver. The cold is taking a hold of me I am beginning to fail. Then I hear something to my south. A yell of an animal. Do I continue on or follow the sound? I hear the yell again. After losing complete site of the reindeer tracks I decide to follow the sound. After about 10 minutes of travelling south I see it\u2026 It\u2019s the reindeer I shot earlier. It nearly doubled backed on me. It\u2019s injured, crippled and fatigued. \u201cYou\u2019re mine now!\u201d I draw and fire my bow. I am so fatigued the arrow hits the tree next to it. Again! I draw and shot my bow. The arrow flies true and I hit it straight in the neck; blood rushes out. It slows and after a few steps staggers then passes out. I approach and finish the job.\nI take a moment to rest but I am too cold to stay still for too long. Night has fallen and I need to rest. I quickly gather some branches and firewood and make a fire. The warmth of the fire gives me a second wind an I decide to skin the animal and butcher some of its meat. I am so hungry I feast on it raw like a ravenous dog. Its late, taking satisfaction of a good kill I decide to sleep for the night. Unfortunately the fire goes out in the middle of the night and I awake in the early hours of the morning chilled yet again. I hear something approaching... I take a moment to scan my surroundings and notice my reindeer has been feasted upon. What could of done this? A dog? No... A bear. As I turn I see the bastard himself. I take a step back and it approaches. I draw my bow and take the shot. My shot is steady and true puncturing the bear in the front of his chest. It\u2019s not enough. It becomes enraged and begins to charge. Before I can react It swipes its massive claw and gashes my arm and chest wide open. I fall back\u2026 I reach for my knife... It finishes me off with a mighty blow. \nHugh Glass would of been disappointed... \n\nThis is just one of my wonderful adventures. Many more await you in the Unreal World. \n\n9 bear tracks out of 10.", "timestamp_created": 1459116144, "timestamp_updated": 1512949488, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 33, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.745095", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22073318": {"recommendationid": "22073318", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967419832", "num_games_owned": 1133, "num_reviews": 181, "playtime_forever": 325, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1463630832}, "language": "english", "review": "I've played UnReal World off and on over the last few years, never really got far but I plan to change that since I've always preferred playing games on steam.

I have read that water is the first priorty so I went looking for some and found a frozen lake. Of course stupid me I walked out onto the lake and fell through! I got back to shore and my character was prone and freezing to death.\n\nSo, I decided f*** it I cut a hole in the ice and had my drink. Then I spotted a fallen log so I crawled to it to make a fire, no luck, needed more timber. So I went to a tree and cut 11 pieces of branches off of it. It took me a while but I figured out how to pick it up. Crawled back to falled log, dropped the timber on it and tried several times to make a fire...finally success and I was able to warm right back up and get it.\n\nIt seems trivival but really it was very exciting to figure out the controls and save myself from freezing to death! Keep in mind playing this on steam is the first time I have ever played this game. my character is still alive. Though he came very very very close to dying of dehydration. I found water, and I had to tear up some of my clothes to make cords but I have successfully made a stone axe, and also I have also successfully crafted a primative bow.\n\nNow I need feathers. I found a bird and hit it with a rock, which I believe wounded it but did not kill it, then I chased it down and threw my spear and missed, kept going after it and collected my spear. Got next to the bird, attacked and killed it, my first kill. \n\nI need to collect the feathers from the bird and clean it so I can cook it. How do I collect the feathers from the bird?

Even if you're totally enamoured with this game by the looks of the descriptions and reviews, I still urge people to play the free version before grabbing the Steam one. Once you've given it a shot, you can make a much better decision on if you want to drop money on it. I told myself that if I played the free version for longer than eight hours, I'd buy the Steam version even if I never boot it up again. I clocked about ten hours, bought it on Steam, then continued to play it for however long it says I have at the top of this review.\n\nI really love this game. It's deep, but I've never felt truly lost; when you make a character, you can pick to have a goal-orientated quest system that teaches you how to play. This ranges from 'This is how you drink water, you [i]gigantic idiot[/i]' to building your own house and trading for animals. Once you've grasped the basics, the game opens up as the survival roguelike it aims to be. If you want to know all the cool mechanics that come with the game, the other positive reviews go into passionate detail about what makes the game great. To avoid clashing with people who have literally hundreds of hours of gametime over me, I'll instead relay something that's unique to me; an in-game story.\n\nFur is really important in UnReal World. It's valuable, it's useful, and it'll stop you from freezing to death when Snow Hell decides to pay a visit. Unfortunately, being a total newbie at the game, the only hides I can get are from squirrels, hares, and ermines. Not very prestigious. The only big hides I had managed to score was one of a bear and an elk, and that's because they fell into a pit trap I set up and became a sitting duck for my volley of arrows. Basically, I'm a bad hunter.\n\nOne day I'm out in the snow in my bear fur clothes, checking my pit traps to see if any more suckers have taken pity on my awful hunting skills. The traps are on the border between a mire and a forest, set up to channel and capture any animals walking from one area to another. This time, I noticed a wolf on the world map standing in the mire, so I zoom in on the action to see what's going on.\n\nTurns out, it's not a wolf. It's a [i]pack[/i] of them.\n\nAt this point of the game, the most dangerous thing I've successfully managed to hunt (that wasn't sitting in a pit and woefully awaiting death) is a fox. All the animals I've come across are basically 'let's see how close I can get before it runs away at the speed of light'. The wolves didn't do that. They decided that I'm up for dinner. They charge at me (\"What? Animals [i]attack[/i] you in this game?!\") and suddenly I'm reaching for my bow. I thought I was a goner, but it turns out that shooting an arrow into the shoulder of a charging wolf is a good deterrent (who knew?). It became a game of scoring a single wound on each attacking wolf to scare them and make them flee. I scored a particularly good hit on one wolf, and I chased down its limping self and attacked its head for a kill. Skinned its fur and butchered its meat and fat. Good stuff.\n\nThat's when I discovered why wolves were even here in the first place; lying in the middle of the field was a wolf-torn elk. I approached it and checked the hide, and was surprised to see the wolves hadn't mangled it beyond recognition. It was about a quarter of the way through skinning it that I realised the wolves were still around -- just keeping their distance. I decided to grab the skin and forget the butchering, get out while I still could. I didn't need the meat, the fur was the real gold here.\n\nSo I walk home with some wolf and elk fur under my arms. The total sum of the furs I had back home came to something like 8lbs; the fur I was carring totalled 30lbs. A good catch! I set the wolf fur down and use its fat from the butchering to tan it. I then set the elk fur down and -- wait! I didn't butcher the elk! I don't have any fat to tan it with! 20lbs of fur was threaning to go rotten on me if I didn't find a solution, and fast.\n\nI dumped the fur in my cold, 'please don't rot on me' cellar and made a return to the elk. Turns out, so had the wolves, and they had regained their courage. Some nasty nips later, I decided my life wasn't worth some fat and fled.\n\nI looked up about the tanning process to try to find alternatives for my elk fur. Turns out, you don't [i]have[/i] to use fat. The skinned barks of alder and rowan trees work just as well. Big problem; I lived in a gigantic forest of pine and birch. So begins the race against time to find an alder or rowan tree before my goldmine attracts flies rather than merchants.\n\nSo I'm darting around the world map, cursing every pine and birch that I see. That's when I find a herd of reindeer milling around. I decided to try my luck, so I zoomed in and took a less-than-hopeful shot at the nearest one, expecting a total miss and all the reindeer to flee. It hits. Fire off a second arrow before the victim has a chance to run. Second one hits.\n\nOh crap. So this is what hunting feels like.\n\nThe reindeer has been so badly hit, it's practically crawling its way across the floor. I catch up with it and start trying to unload arrows into its head. My aim is so bad that it ends up hitting the shoulder, body, and even one hit on the knee, at which point I reprimanded UnReal World for its poor choice of meme references. It was around the time I decided to equip a javelin and start poking its head that my character falls asleep. Turns out, fighting wolves and lugging fur across a continent really tires a man out. Who knew?\n\nI awoke with the reindeer nowhere in sight. I followed its tracks and found it only a short run away, still desperately trying to crawl its way to freedom. I started poking at its head with the javelin until it dies, skinned it, made sure to grab the fat this time, and recovered the arrows I had fired. The fat of the reindeer was enough to tan its own hide, but not enough to tan the elk's. The hunt for the tree was still on.\n\nI read up on alder and rowan trees, and found out that they mostly grow in and around villages. So I poked my head into the local village and -- sure enough -- sitting in the middle of the field all proud of itself was an alder tree. The villagers were probably weirded out to see a man walk into their village, cry 'YES!' and then begin frantically carving the bark off of one of their trees. I didn't care. Elk fur was back in fashion, baby.\n\nSo that's how I went from Small Game Extraordinaire to sleeping in the furs of a wolf, elk, and reindeer, all because I decided to go check my traps for a bit. My bear fur clothes had some nasty wolf bites in them and I had sufffered a few nasty scratches myself, but I could probably line the entirety of my house in fur now. It was about this time I realised that maybe, just maybe, UnReal World is an awesome game and that I'm glad I got it.\n\nStay safe in the cold North, folks!", "timestamp_created": 1458084734, "timestamp_updated": 1458084961, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 134, "votes_funny": 14, "weighted_vote_score": "0.919826", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21820674": {"recommendationid": "21820674", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066333644", "num_games_owned": 114, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 2634, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490117953}, "language": "english", "review": "sweet little sandbox / roguelike survival game. it\u00b4s a great example that a game doesn\u00b4t neet the latest in graphics and special hurray to be entertaining. it captures you by presenting the core of survival: you against all odds. \n\nok, it has it\u00b4s flaws. once you master the basic survival needs, it basically becomes a ressource management game where your ressources are\nenergy (you can only do so much during a day)\nhunger\nthirst\ntemperature\n\nbut if you know thr basic mechanics and have learned a few things, you are set up pretty fast pretty good. after that ...\n\nanyways: \ngreat gameplay\ngreat presentation (for such a game)\n\nwould die of starvation / cold again\n9/10", "timestamp_created": 1457895228, "timestamp_updated": 1457895228, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21800829": {"recommendationid": "21800829", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991084138", "num_games_owned": 221, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 9525, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493263506}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty simple in mose aspects, hunting is pretty good though.", "timestamp_created": 1457821799, "timestamp_updated": 1457821799, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.478632", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21787455": {"recommendationid": "21787455", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012838737", "num_games_owned": 442, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 429, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490278629}, "language": "english", "review": "Class A survival game.\nI've played this over 10 years and still return to it with every new patch", "timestamp_created": 1457783901, "timestamp_updated": 1457783901, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21771818": {"recommendationid": "21771818", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077897997", "num_games_owned": 36, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 8039, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510309035}, "language": "english", "review": "edit: I initially gave this game a negative rating, but as you can see, I'm now 40+ hours into the game, so I've now changed it to positive.\n\nThe reason for the initial negative rating is the rather-unfriendly UI.

I'm the kind of gamer who likes to sit back and relax in my chair while clicking on my mouse, rather than hunch over the keyboard in an upright position, so I wasn't pleased in the beginning. The dozens of keyboard commands are difficult to remember and will force you to consult the \"help\" page every so often.\n\nHowever, if you can tolerate this, Unreal World becomes a beautiful sandbox game. You can do whatever you want, whether it be to become a farmer, hunter, lumberjack, fisherman, bandit, serial killer etc. The main \"goal\" is to survive winter, which is harsh and deadly, so most of your time will be devoted to hunting and gathering food, and building a suitable shelter for the cold season. How you approach this is up to you. \n\nMy main complaint (besides the unfriendly UI) is that the game world can feel lonely at times. At present, you're not able to marry anyone or have kids. You do have the option of hiring adventurers and workers, but they will only stay with you for a short time and then leave. You can't move into a village or improve it.

Well now, through the magic of computer roleplaying, you can at last find out!\n\nThis game is a pretty innovative blend of roguelike and survival simulator that dates back to several decades before the current survival game craze. The presentation and interface are true to that era, and so really shouldn't be a hindrance unless you're a millenial casual babby, in which case I congratulate you on managing to read this far without losing interest and playing with your smartphone, you little shit. \n\nThe only area where this doesn't really hold is with certain repeated commands - putting down several fishing nets in succession involves a number of awkward key combinations, and the process of chopping down trees and hauling them to a location (which you WILL need to do if you want a house) will inevitably strain your fingers to the point where you will certainly come to sympathize with your likewise strained and fatigued character.\n\nBesides that, the graphics are charming and effective - the sprites stand out, look good and tell you what you need to know, and the menus are decorated with quaint images of Finnish cosplayers in their natural habitat.\n\nBut enough about that nonsense! You want to hear about gameplay! The areas where this game really excels are its depth, realism and immersiveness. You begin play at a season of your choice, either in the wilderness or in a friendly, desolate or hostile settlement, depending on the starting scenario of your choice, equipped with either very little or nothing at all to help you weather the oncoming trials. From that point on, you have just one overarching goal: survive.\n\nThis isn't nearly as easy as you might think - not because everything is trying to kill you (in fact, the opposite is more likely to be true), but rather because getting the necessities of life is [i]hard[/i]. Hunting, for example, requires that you first find prey - which involves a great deal of fruitless wandering and scouring the land for tracks. You might follow a fresh and promising trail to the point where you're only a hair's breadth away from your quarry, only to have it suddenly go cold, prompting profound disappointment. If you do find prey, your problems only multiply, as you then have to make a decision - do you close the distance and risk spooking the game in order to get a better shot? Or take the one you have, and risk missing to the same effect?\n\nManaging risks and resources is in many ways the core of the gameplay. You have to choose not only how to conduct your activities, but which activities to embark on, as each have their associated risks and rewards. A hunt is likely to fail, can be dangerous, and is wont to leave you far from home and exhausted come night time. Fishing is safe, but consumes large amounts of your time and might return nothing at all, or an insufficient catch. There are no sure bets, however, and you'll inevitably have to go all in at some point. Sometimes you'll fail. That's just life.\n\nLikewise, every activity has its associated costs. Not necessarily in resources, but always in your character's time and energy. Building a house will give you a leg up, but chopping down trees and hewing logs is hard work that's sure to leave you with an appetite, and to make it worse, all that time you spent doing that was time you didn't spend acquiring food. Consequently, much of the earlier game is an exercise in building a big enough stockpile to be able to do more time-intensive work without worrying about what you'll eat tomorrow. This is difficult, as the most easily acquired foods (fish and meat) spoil rapidly without some means to preserve them, and even if you do get lucky enough to kill an elk early on, there's no way you can eat all the resultant meat all by yourself before it will spoil.\n\nStill, though, overcoming all of those challenges as they come at you brings on a sense of elation like little else in video games.

There are numerous tasks always available for you to do, and the objective is simply to survive. But almost inevitably: you won't.\n\nYour character struggles mostly against nature (and the occasional bandit or warrior). The weather, the ice, the BEARS. Go fishing, go hunting, go trading. Make tools and weapons and traps. Whatever you think you could do in an Iron-Age Scandinavian forest, you can do it in this game, with astonishing attention to detail and realism.\n\nThe animal A.I. is amazing. Wolves split and converge over long-distances with their packs, howling for communication. Kill the biggest reindeer in a pack (the leader) and the other reindeer will become aimless until they're picked off by other prey. \n\nCombat, while not action-based, has a cold realism to it unlike anything I've seen. Your life isn't measured in \"Hit points\"... Rather your body, your limbs, your blood, your senses: they can all be attacked and taken away from you -- or you can take them away from your enemy. One hit in the right spot will debilitate you. Game over. But its a death that will make you smile. Dying is a part of nature, and a part of this game. Fight against it, but realize that its what makes your character's adventure... complete.\n\nHunting in this game is a challenge and never a guaranteed success. You, the player, as a person, need to learn the value of patience and deligence. But when you finally manage to track down your first elk or stag through vast reaches of forest, until at last the animal is too fatigued to run anymore... there is NO \"kill\" in a videogame I've found as satisfying as this. Yesterday I got really lucky, and chased a panicked reindeer that injured itself trying to scale down a cliff -- but when I finally caught up to it, a wolf had half-eaten its corpse, ruining the precious fur and making off with some of the meat.\n\nSmoke/Dry the meat, tan the skin, feed your dog, and donate a cut of meat to the \"gods\" for letting you live another day. Work on building your cabin, or preparing the cold soil for future agriculture. There is so much to do, and it is all vital, well-designed, brilliant. This is a brilliant one-of-a-kind game that throws you into a real world like no other game I've ever played. There is no game I would more enthusiastically urge people to try.

They might be interesting and fun, but only in few cases I really get hooked. I have played the steam version of URW for only 10 realtime hours (44 ingame days), but they flew by like nothing and I feel like I will  keep returning to this game.\n\nLike with all games, I would only recommend the game if the setting appeals to you, which is based on stone age Finnland with all its harshness and mythology. Just watch the steam launch trailer, if it seems interesting to you, it might be worth buying this game. You have to be prepared to do some reading, there is a lot of ingame lore and many things you need to know in order to survive. The use of the online wiki is not required, there is a tutorial and an ingame encyclopedia, but still the wiki can be really helpful at times. Also, you will need to learn many keybindings and how to operate the game by keyboard. That is certainly not a game for the totally impatient, they won't survive long.\n\nBut that does not mean that the game is boring, there is a huge world waiting for you to be explored. And there is always something to do, there are different ways to keep your belly filled, as a hunter, fisher, farmer, trader and so on, but no matter which career(s) you choose, you won't be able to lean back. I haven't played a survival game yet which felt so realistic. I felt so happy when after few days of unsuccesful hunting, after many animals escaped me (despite following their track), and near starvation, for the first time I finally managed to kill a stag. I butchered it and cooked the pieces, which fed me for several days, until they got spoiled. I wasn't wise enough to smoke/dry them or to build a cellar for storage. I learned from it and my character became really promising, until I made the mistake to fight a couple of robbers, which led to an early death when I failed to treat my wounds. The game tells its own stories and even though the graphics seem horrible, the immersion is greater than in any other game I have played so far.

I further did research online, and though the developer doesn't have a FB or Twitter account I was able to pull up very high reviews of this game and fans hashtags on twitter. I own and play games like Radiation Island, SurvivalCraft (over Minecraft), KoDP and few other survival/RPG type games, so I had to check this out. \n\nTo cut right to the chase this URW is awesome! \n\nFor this game to be 20 something y/o and still going strong with devouted fans and newbies (like myself) is amazing!

Whenever I was in doubt, I would always refer to wiki via my tablet to free up space on my monitor, or hit (SHIFT + ?) for the layout of the key commands. I'm playing on a Mac so I think the key layout might be a just a little different from PC, but no big deal.  Still have a ways to go by getting full grasp of this game, but overall I love it and have no regrets spending $ for I didn't know the game was free till after purchase.

You create a character from scratch with tons of skills at your disposal. The player is given a lot of freedom and tools which grants a lot of variety. You can play vastly different and try various survival tactics in order to overcome nature and it's threats. Be a fisherman, farmer, hunter, gatherer or a bandit. You're given the choice.\n\nThe world itself is vast and filled with tons of items, creatures, immersion, lore and danger. It's very intricate and engaging with a great amount of detail. Every task that action that you perform has consequences and keeping your characters alive is really a challenge, furthermore the entire game is designed in a realistic way which only enhances the immersion. From fishing to hideworking or combat, everything is rough and has detail. It's a engrossing and hostile world.\n\nA great aspect is the interactive story, despite not having a full blown campaign. You can chose from a variety of character backgrounds which vastly changes the start of your adventure. Start as a well equipped hunter or fisherman but if you're up for the challenge you can play as a runaway slave that is being hunted. You make your own story and it's done with such detail that you feel really immersed. Even though the minimalistic graphics aren't that advanced, the presentation is solid. The small amount of songs and sound effect will still grab your attention, as for the rest the text provides enough flavor to really make you feel like this lonesome adventurer. This is pretty much standard for most roguelike though but this theme really resonates with me compared to other dungeon crawlers.\n\nThe interface and controls are somewhat unintuitive but once you get used to it, it's really not that much of a deal. It might be a hassle at first to browse through the various menus but it's all set up in a reasonable fashion. That might be the biggest issue about this game, also there aren't many sound effects but it's still solid enough.\n\nOverall this is a very lovely game and crafted with such dedication, if this type of game doesn't appeal to you. You will probably get frustrated and not really enjoy it. But if you do, you will be rewarded with a great survival game that actually makes you think about provide a good challenge, while having a strong theme with a realistic tone.\n\nDefinitely worth the price.

There is a free version the creators website, but it is an older version. The latest version on steam has a revamped graphics and new features. The new graphical upgrade does look better. You can zoom out and see much further or zoom in close to your character. This game may not have eye candy graphics but its gameplay pulls you in. Its a survivalist game where the details can kill you. You have to think about what you are going to do next, based on your characters condition and the environment, how much food you have, fatigue and sleep etc. Merely eating any food wont in the long run do you any good if you stick to fish for example because your nutrition will suffer, which means you get fatigued faster. You can trap, track and hunt game. But its not easy, often they get away, but some game are easier to catch than others like squirrels for example. One time i was nearly straving and came back to my camp before it got dark and discovered one of my small deadfall traps had my dinner. There are aspects of the game i havent delved into yet, such as owning a dog which can help out with hunting. The game is turn based, but you can still get into trouble with burning your food if you go off and do a long consuming task or sleep, or you can have your food spoil if you do not eat it in a reasonable time or preserve it. There are NPC in the game whom you can trade with to get better quality gear which makes doing tasks much faster eg. chopping down trees with an iron axe instead of a stone axe. There is many skills you can invest into and level up. Some other features in the pipeline sound interesting, such as being able to marry and have offsrping which when your character dies you can resume as one of your offspring.

The gameplay has a ton of freedom and depth, and the setting is rich in its historical atmosphere and lore. \n\nThere are many ways to play, you could be a farmer, hunter, a gatherer, a fisherman, a adventurer or trader as you find your path in this harsh, gritty world. There are no set rules, you decide where to go and what to do. Despite the simple graphics the gameplay is very realistic. It takes creativity and experience to accomplish some of the harder tasks like hunting. You really feel like you're part of the world as you make your way through the four seasons every year.\n\nThe game has its roots as a ASCII-based roguelike. If you've never played one of those before it might seem daunting to learn the controls, since for these games there're a lot of commands, akin to playing a flight simulator on the keyboard.

I've been playing this game like crazy for the past few days though. I saw the game in my discovery queue and thought it looked interesting. I'm a bit of a cheapskate though and I've been burned by so many games in the past that I didn't want to jump right on it. As I'm reading through the comments, I see mention that you can download and play the game from the developer's website. So I gave it a shot. At first I was a bit overwhelmed but after looking over a couple guides, I started figuring it out a bit.\n\nSo I've been playing a bunch for the last couple days and I'm really loving the game. At this point, I decided that I was going to buy this game and support the developer. This isn't some big company. It's a small indie thing and this guy has a huge set of cojones making his game available for free while also selling it on Stream. That shows confidence in your work. It IS that good. It's worth buying even though I could play it for free. I've already talked it up to a couple friends and they're going to try it out as well. Get the word of mouth going on this one.\n\nSo actually talking about the game itself. The graphics aren't anything to speak of but they don't need to be. This isn't a splashing graphical game for the Xbox crowd. This is an old school game but it's got depth that the old school games couldn't pull off. You start the world as a Nordic person back in the Iron Age. In most of the scenarios (there are many you can choose from) you start off alone. Usually you've got some basic supplies and a day or two worth of food. From here you've got to find food, build shelter, and stay alive! I've been starting in the summer. My goal has been to build a cabin before the winter hits. That's not an easy task. It's not like other survival games where it's simplified. Building takes lots of time and effort. Fishing, hunting, and trapping are difficult! It's easy to get lost in this game for hours. \n\nHighly reccommended!", "timestamp_created": 1456948784, "timestamp_updated": 1456948784, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500156", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21585358": {"recommendationid": "21585358", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040923434", "num_games_owned": 2292, "num_reviews": 79, "playtime_forever": 1646, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508983485}, "language": "english", "review": "It is the most poetic and one the most violent games.

The UI can definitely be improved in some areas, among other things, but the devs are constantly improving the game and it is possible these issues are fixed later on. As an example of the overall attention to detail from the developer, The latest update (the first version released on Steam) added improved winter mechanics, making snow and ice thicker and thinner as winter comes and goes and adding the possibility of breaking the ice, adding another highly plausible way of dying during winter. Something else that has been in the game for some time is one of (if not THE most) advanced animal AI that isn't just randomly walking around, like other games.\n\nIn summary, it's a highly competent survival game, and the Steam version is currently just a way to pay the devs for the amazing amount of work they have done.

Go check out the game on their website for free: http://www.unrealworld.fi/ \n You have to put in some effort to learn the controls (which don't take long, depending on how custom you are with roguelikes and basic keyboard layout) You also need to be able to use your imagination (which is our greatest gift for video games) to immerse yourself in your own world. Once you feel comfortable with that, you are set.\n\n[list]\n[*]Unreal World sets the player close to the iron age of human history located in Finland. You can see from the start as soon as you launch the game that the traditional and folklore of the finnish culture is in place by listening to the music. The Kantele is being used which is part of the Finnish culture and it immediately tries to immerse the player in its rich world. \n\n[*]You choose a culture and then roll some stats. The world is then randomly generated and you get to choose a beginning \"story\" or setup to how you will play the first moments of the game. Each scenario has some sort of interesting background to help you be ready and immersed in the world. They are all interesting and some provide tools to help you get started.\n\n[*]If you survive your initial scenario (depending if you chose a violent one) you are then free to do what you wish. Ultimately Unreal World is a simulator of sorts to show the player how our world is a dangerous one without the need of zombies and Rust like 24/7 violence. Like the Finnish Proverb says \"The world will surely teach one; if nothing else, than to walk slowly.\" It's very true! \n\n[/list]\n\nI won't go into details of what you can do because basically there are SO many things you can do and everything necessary is there to survive. If you were someone that read this because you thought you wouldn't be able to learn this or hate it for the graphics; well good for you b/c there are mods, in-game tutorials, encylopedia, and online guides.\n\n[h1] Pros [/h1]\n+ Very Immersive\n+ A game that allows players to use their imagination\n+ Awesome Developers (Thanks Sami and Erkka)\n+ In Depth Combat System\n+ In Depth Injury System from cuts/bruises, to diseases and so much more\n+ Accurate Historical Items and Folklore\n+ Easily Moddable\n+ High Replayability\n\n[h1] Cons [/h1]\n-Roguelike Graphics: This is a con for some players used to modern graphics (Latest Update Improved them and mods help)\n-Slight learning curve with keys (but is easily fluid once you get used to it)\n-Could use more sounds IMO but overall very well done\n-Pictures are somewhat corny but overall they do well (personal taste and easily moddable and mods help)\n\nOverall, this is the TRUE survival game. I have over 400 hours of Rust and have played just about every survival game out there, but Unreal World just keeps pulling me back in for its in depth system of how we humans are adapted to survive in the impossible. This game allows me to use my imagination and do what I cannot do in my daily life.\n\n[h1] Final Score: 95/100 [/h1]\nThank you so much for reading!", "timestamp_created": 1456717383, "timestamp_updated": 1511520531, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 76, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.829492", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21537726": {"recommendationid": "21537726", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006488265", "num_games_owned": 182, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 17, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1456709450}, "language": "english", "review": "Far from a game that is for everyone, UnReal World is a gritty and realistic game of death versus survival, with your actions and luck dictating the outcome. \n\nI have played this many times over the years, and the improvements have been great.

UnReal World... Where do I start? I started playing  it back in december of 2014 and since then, I am hooked! the graffics may not be the best (the new ones look great, dont get me wrong) but who needs graphics when you have such an emersive, rich game that can take you to places you always wished you could go! For me, what got me into this game at first was curiosity, but I had a feeling I would like it, and oh boy do I! You start off with a multitude of scenarios, wich can greatly challenge you or make life easier for your character. And if you're into challenges, make up your own! with a multitude of skills to learn and master. But skills in UnReal World aren't like skyrim or Unturned, its a pore realistic approach where the more you practice, the better you get IE, you want to raise your cooking skill, cook stuff! But what you can cook doesnt depend on your cooking skill, the taste depends on your skill. For crafting skills, there's obviously no taste, quality is the factor. All and all, the game itself is HUGE, not in size itself, but in its potential for your mind to create more of the game. right now, I've started a new character for the steam release, but before that, I played with a character for a WHOLE 9 MONTHS... IRL. and I didn't get bored once. I have to admit I got my fair share of near death experiences, which is scary since the game is PERMADEATH.

I'm twenty-four years old so this game has been \"In-Dev\" my entire existence and it shows through in some good and bad ways*. When I saw UnReal World on Steam my jaw dropped, I loaded $25 onto my wallet, and bought it immediately. No regrets.\n\nI'm going to do a light Pros & Cons to sum the why of it up.\n\nPros: \n\n+ Deep game mechanics.\n+ Actually a survival game. (Unlike Rust/The Forest/ and others that make the claim)\n+ High Replayability.\n+ Immersive Lore.\n+ Progressive skills.\n+ Massive crafting system.\n+ Extensive Medical system.\n+ Many mods made by the community and refined over time.\n+ Easy to create your own mods. Google the resources you need and the system is easy to learn.\n\nCons:\n\n-- Mixture of Traditional & Digitized sprites for graphics.\n-- Complex context menus required for maneveuring through the game.\n- Basic/dated sound effects.\n\n\nNeutral (Because this could be a plus for some, a negative for others.)\n\n* +/- Overall a dated old-school look and feel.\n\n  +/- A slight lack of \"end-game\" content, but reaching the end-game takes plenty of time and new updates are planned to rectify this.  A few of the planned updates are: family management, village ceremonies, and more. This is all detailed on the development page.\n\n  +/- End game content  by 3rd party developers. I think that a game's merit shouldn't be based off the content created by the community, but while you're waiting on new updates things like the Shaman mod can give you your fix of additional content. It adds many \"rituals\" that feel lore-friendly and allow you to delve into spiritual magic and ultimately align yourself with light or darkness.\n\n+/- It is lacking in music overall, but the new title screen music is promising.\n\n\nDue to the time when the project was initially started the game has been stuck in the past as far as graphics, sound, and the general presentation goes.\n\nThe skin isn't beautiful, but the meat is sturdy and supple. [It must be a Kaumo.]\nFor those who aren't deterred by the time investment it takes to learn this game it is worthwhile and has more to come.\n\nYou can check out the developer's plans over on the website under the Development tab. \n\nhttp://www.unrealworld.fi/urw_development.html\n\nProtips for those who intend to buy it/already have:\n\n(I'll update this as I think of more.)\n\n! Use the mouse wheel to zoom in/out. This is very useful for hunting.\n\n! The help menu is your friend. Even for seasoned veterans.\n\n! Dogs are man's best friends for a reason. They make hunting much easier.\n\n! Humans used to use a method called \"Persistence Hunting\" to hunt down big game. The short of it is you use your incredible endurance to run an animal down and track it until it collapses from exhaustion then shower it with arrows or beat it to death in its sleep. How metal is that?\n\n! Try to spawn close to the Driikil\u00e4iset people (Cyan on the map, toggle culture colors on) so that you can trade with their massive amounts of shops if you find a village. You'll do quite well for yourself by peddling your crafts to them for various supplies.\n\n! Trap fences can be difficult to get the hang of, but making a house relatively near one can help guarantee your cellar stays stocked throughout the winter.\n\n! When starving and tracking down an animal have ranged weaponry. \nYou miss 100% of the shots you don't take -Lebron James on hunting, maybe.\n\n!!! Don't give up. Every death is a chance to learn or try something different although it is frustrating to lose your progress. If you really don't want to lose out on it (and this is often frowned upon, but your own choice) then you pull up task manager (Control + Alt + Delete) and end the URW.exe process before going through the menu that deletes your character/progress. Everything that happened up to your death will be the same when you reload the game. You lose out on the experience, but it is your purchase and decision.\n\n\nEDIT:  Actually, since I was born in 1992 and the game was released then it has been in-dev all my life.

I *think* that makes it the game with the longest development time - at least more so than either Dwarf Frotress or the Duke Nukem. 24 years of work, as of the time of this review in 2016.\n\nSo what can you do in this game? Good question. You might recall how Todd Howard likes to say of Bethesda's releases that you can 'climb any mountain' or 'do anything' - well, you couldn't. In UrW you can come a whole lot closer to doing anything, though!\n\nEvery aspect of life (bar taking a shit and fucking someone, which is probably for the best) is covered. A massive amount of attention to detail has been made, and there are absolutely shedloads of historically accurate items, foods and activites you can access. What's more, the game (despite being a roguelike and keyboard-based, which may initially pout a lot of people off) is very accessible due to its fantastic in-game wiki.\n\nWhat I've always loved in particular is that you set your own goals, something that no other RPG I've ever seen has done so well:\n\n* Want to hunt a bear? Sure, get tracking! But first you need to make sure you're well prepared. Should you take the spear, the bow or both? Is it worth buying a hunting dog to help you out? Maybe you'll need a companion from a local village to cover your back? How much food will you need for the journey? There are so many things to consider.\n\n* Exploration is crazy in this game! I mean, the gameworld is literally Finland. The very size. It's enormous.\n\n* Perhaps it's time to settle down; building a settlement in UrW is incredibly rewarding, but by no means easy work! I've never found anything as satisfying in a game as having completed a gleaming wooden longhall, complete with mead benches and a roaring hearth. It took me several in-game months to achieve and arrived just in time for winter. Winter is brutal in this game!\n\n* If you somehow feel your options aren't already wide enough, the game is incredibly easy to mod! Making and adding mods are both simple processes and widely expand the gameplay; what's more, since modding for the most aprt relies on adding .txt and .png files, there's practically a 0% chance that you could damage your game with mods (unlike certain other franchises), so go crazy!\n\nA final note is that the UrW forums having been running for years and in that time the developers Sami and Erkka have been amazing; they have listened to every player suggestion, answered every question they could and are highly aware of what can make the game better. There never has been, and never will be, a shitty update. It's been getting better for 24 continuous years, and can only improve in the future!

For now this is my 2nd livestream and exprerience with this game:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWYcKY7PVG8\n\nWow!  if you are looking for a deep, engaging, procedural survival game that will offer you a complete sandbox and tons of game choices, options, and endless possible games (no two games will be the same, guaranteed)... then LOOK NO FURTHER.  \n\nThis game is vast.  This game is mind-boggling at all of its choices, options, and different scenarios.\n\nTruly amazing.  \n\nThis score might change as I play the game more, and ain't such a darn 'noob' at all its vast possibilties...  But after 2 hours... I think I can give this game a pretty accurate first impressions score based on my own scoring system...\n\nVALUE:  40 out of 40  -  Yes you can play it for free on the games website, but why not get the best and most up-to-date version of this game, and help support the developer who has made this masterfully done game and been working on it since 1992!  Value is through the roof even at the regular price of $10.99 USD.  No brainer, max value here people.\n\nFUN:  26 out of 30  -  This part of the game is the part that will likely vary the most and be more subjective depending on who you are and what kind of games personally enjoy.  But to me, this game offers a very rich and deep game, the kind of game that can only be accessed by using the power of your imagination to truly immerse you in its world.\n\nCONTROLS & BUGS: 20 out of 20 - The controls are many in this game, and the UI (user interface) takes a bit of learning, but there is plenty of in-game help and features to help you learn.  Beautifully done with more options that you can throw a stick at! \n\nGRAPHICS & SOUND: 6 out of 10 - This is going to be the lowest score for this game and again, it's a bit subjective.  I'm giving this game a \"6\" based on the TYPE of game it is, and thinking its very clear what is a rock, what is water, what is a tree, etc.  Other people may give this game a 1 or a 2 score here out of 10, but again, this is a different type of game and in my opinion needs to be scored as the type of game it is, so it gets a 6 out of 10 from me.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nMY TOTAL LAUNCH DAY ON STEAM \nFIRST IMPRESSIONS (2 HOURS) SCORE:  92%\n\nEasily a MUST BUY for any person who likes good RPG games like this and isn't concerned about not having 3D next gen graphics to enjoy it!

After 15 years it's awesome to finally see it come to the mainstream public attention, and I have nothing but praise for the game.\n\nAt its core, it's your basic roguelike game: perma-death, turn-based, keyboard-heavy and with 2d pixel tiles instead of fancy graphics. Actually, it started out way back (it's in development since 1992) as a fairly standard fantasy game, but then slowly transformed into a realistic life simulator in the setting of iron age Finland.\n\nYou will have to survive by crafting needed stuff, hunting/gathering/fishing/putting out traps and get food, wood and pelts to make items and/or to trade for things you can't craft like axes or pots, and get better armor and weapons to fight off wild beasts and nasty humans (they come in the form of either bloodthirsty Njerpez warriors that will only settle for your death, or simple robbers that will try to get your stuff either by talking or by bludgeoning you over the head). Also of course you'll get tired and need to sleep, eat, and drink.\n\nThe game has a day-night cycle, full-on weather and seasons system: in summer the temperatures are bearable even without being covered head to toe in furs, berries and plants to eat are readily available, there's plenty of game to hunt and life is generally easier (you will get mauled by a bear nonetheless, don't worry)\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, winter is harsh: days are short and nights are long, it gets freezing cold and you WILL die from hypothermia so you have to build shelter, possibly an elaborate log cabin complete with fireplace, table and bed, make enough firewood to keep warm and get a decent source of food or a good plan for having enough in those long, boring months. Ice will cover the rivers and lakes so to fish you'll have to poke holes in it, and if you're not careful you can walk on thin ice that will break and drop you into freezing water. Also snow accumulates on the ground and unless you have skis, you won't be able to walk very long without getting incredibly tired so you better have everything you need not too far away. On the upside it also allows you to spot tracks much easier. Too bad there are few animals around in winter...\n\nI could speak about the game all day but this would become too long, so I'll just say one last thing, and it's the thing that impressed me most:\n\nThis game is a labor of love. Over the many years I've been playing this, a LOT of things have changed, and always for the better. Just since last year or so, there's a totally new trading / reputation system with villages, most exploits have been squashed and replaced with sensible mechanics, you can command your pet dog and it's even more of a killing machine, new animal AI especially for predators that will actively hunt their prey (have sheeps in a pen? be careful of wolves!), addition of more birds and seals you can club, and the list goes on and on. It's a truly well supported game that is worth at least double what they're asking, so if you're interested in this kind of game and don't mind that it's keyboard-heavy and has 2d graphics, it is a MUST BUY.", "timestamp_created": 1456531694, "timestamp_updated": 1456531741, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.603006", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21486122": {"recommendationid": "21486122", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001850020", "num_games_owned": 174, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 208, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502904933}, "language": "german", "review": "Also das Spiel kommt mir auch vor wie aus der Eisenzeit.

I'm huge fan of this game and it's been a long while since i've played it. I have played countless hours of this game. I was reallu surprised to see this on steam! I had to buy it. \n\nThe steam market is over saturated with multiple poor \"survival\" games that take all inspiration from minecraft. But this game has uniques spin on it. It's been in development from the year 1996. This has been a passion project of one man. Since this has come to steam I had to buy it. \n\nThis game is based on fictional ironage Finland. It's the only game that embrases finnish-culture bigtime. \n\nThis is REAL roguelike game! Turns, tiles, permadeath, perma everything, super hard and super depressing. It can be daunting to use this games interface. It's mostly keyboard driven. It' will take sme time, but in a while you'll get to enjoy a deep game.\n\nWhat is this game all about: survival in wilderness. REAL survival. You are only human in huge, vast wilderness. You'll get cold, hungry, thirsty and injured. You'll die and you'll mourn your ancestors. \nThe world in this game is HUGE and there is lot to do. The wilderness does not care about you. It's mostly empty and you\u00e4ll rarely even see wildlife. It's realistic in that way. Some times you'' get to meet other people in settlement or just wandering around wilderness just like you. Some of them are even hostile. But the main enemy here is the wilderness it'\u00e4s self and inevitable winter. Winter is to be dreaded.\nMostly it revolves around getting food. Yes the real survival is all about food. You may be farmer, wich is hard, because winter is always coming. You can hunt for you food, but animals are superhard to catch and some of them are just ready to kill you instead. You can fish wich can be good, but you may drown while setting nets or starve when waters are frozen. Sometimes you'll need to rely on cannibalism, but this is surely way to get killed. \nThere is crafting in this game. You'll get to build your house or some basic equipment. House is essential, because it's shelters you from winter. You can craft some weapons, but only crude ones. Best ones you need to buy usually with valuables like fur, food or equipment. YOU are not Tony Stark who builts everything out of box of scrap.\n\nThere are tons of features to be mentioned. \n\nPlay this, and be free. \n", "timestamp_created": 1456515697, "timestamp_updated": 1456515697, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.544951", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21481441": {"recommendationid": "21481441", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018230025", "num_games_owned": 65, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 160, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481143823}, "language": "finnish", "review": "When you play this game, you understand that this is a REAL survival game.

The camp has pretty much everything I need except water so I take off looking for water. I must have been wandering snowblind and dehydrated because when I snap out of my stupor I'm standing in the middle of a frozen lake. I learn this just in time to fall through the ice. \n\nI am finally able to get out of the water and back on to the ice, so I then start crawling for the shore. I get to the shore and I realize \"hey, I can make a hole in the ice and drink the water\". As I am raising my axe to punch the hole, some tribesman I do not know walks up and politely informs me that I will donate all my stuff to him. I tell him to go to hell and as bad as I just wanted a drink of that cool water, I turn the axe on the interloper who then whistles for his friend (up to this point I though that his use of the words \"us\" and \"we\" was just an eccentricity...like the royal \"We\"). \n\nWith an axe in one hand and a knife in the other I am getting the better of this upstart worm of a thief, but I can see his friend has come out of the treeline with a huge - what I can only describe as a \"pole\". I guess it was supposed to be a staff but no normal man would wield this giant piece of wood as a staff. I get back to the business at hand and I have finally killed the thief who started this whole affair.  When I look up again the other thief has closed the distance and brains me with this monstrous tree that he has carried with him.

In solid, continuous development since 1992, URW has no end in sight, with Enormous Elk (developers Sami and Erkka) continuing their work in bringing Iron Age Totally-Not-Finland to life.\n\nURW is the epitome of survival games, yet predates the current craze by literally decades. It's realistic, it's tough, it's unforgiving, and extremely rewarding to play. There is a lot of depth and complexity to explore, and you can live your (probably short) life as a fisherman, hunter, trader, hermit, cannibal, raider... whatever strikes your fancy.\n\nRoguelike mechanics, charming tileset graphics, and harsh survival interweaved with a touch of mysticism and the spirit of nature (which is simulated in great detail, from plants to animals to weather and seasons). Playing URW is simultaneously zen, and at times stressful (when you fall from a tree and break all your limbs and freeze to death, or almost anything to do with bears). \n\nHighly recommended, and sold for a pittance.

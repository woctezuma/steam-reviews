It's a super crate box clone where you get new items randomly from vendors and try to kill enemies before they grow stronger, they grow stronger the longer they're alive.\n\nThe randomness can be frustrating, but this game is super addictive, honestly.

Every level randomly presents you with one of a handful objectives ranging from surviving until a timer runs out, to shutting off devices before they catastrophically overheat, to retrieving fuel rods from one part of the map and depositing them in another location.  Along the way, you're beset by a variety of enemies (the titular aliens) and, true to form, \"game over\" is a single death away.\n\nFortunately, you'll have access to a generous array of unlockable weapons and items scattered throughout the game--and this, in my opinion, is where the game shines.  The sheer variety of weapons and items may be impressive, but the fact that they're generally well-balanced is shocking--particularly when you consider how diverse they are.  There's the shotgun with its typical buckshot spread, the sniper rifle that pierces multiple targets, a laser that becomes more powerful as it fires, and...an electric pogo stick?  \n\nYet you'll discover combinations and quirks that aren't immediately obvious.  Orbs ordinarily prevent you from firing your weapons while you carry them, but if you're using that electric pogo stick, you're still able to kill enemies...because the pogo works by dropping down on their heads (plus it lets you move faster!)  The explosive boomerang will injure you if it's still armed when it returns...but if you're nimble, you can kite it around indefinitely, letting it chew up enemies as you run around with your sidearm.  The \"Mega Chakra\" is a sloppy and temperamental thing, yet even after being abandoned for another weapon, it'll violently react to enemy contact.\n\nAnd that's to say nothing of all the sidearms, explosives, defensive items, special abilities, and perks the game has to offer.  Hacking modules, a transforming blaster for a sidearm, remote satchel charges, a radioactive unit that passively accumulates the resource used for special abilities, teleporters, forcefields, etc.  The point is that there's a great variety of tools at your disposal, and many complement each other in unexpected ways.  Since each player can hold a primary weapon, sidearm, explosive, special ability, defensive ability, and perk at any given time, the combinations and strategies are surprisingly vast.  Perhaps not quite \"Binding of Isaac\" levels, but great nonetheless.\n\nThere's a commendable ecology of enemies, as well, bolstered by the game's mutation mechanic:  Smaller, weaker alien variations will grow into monstrous versions if exposed to too much radiation (the result of leaving them alive for too long while radioactive beacons are spilling green light everywhere) or if they pick up the green radiation pellets that drop as ammo for special abilities.  In other words, if an enemy beats the player to the pellet, not only do they begin mutating into a more powerful version of themselves, but the player is denied a valuable resource.   It's a refreshing dynamic and forces a balance between hoovering up pellets despite your tank being full, and leaving them until you need them (but risking the chance that they benefit an enemy instead). \n\nAt the lowest difficulty, the game is appropriately easy; on the hardest, the average player won't be able to sleepwalk through a run (sleeprun?).  And despite getting killed a lot at higher difficulties, I can't recall any moments where I felt like the game cheated me.\n\nOf course, if you're still having trouble, the couch co-op allows two players to tackle all 12 levels together on one screen.  Combined with the aforementioned abundance of strange and novel items, this feature makes for some intense and hilarious moments that really amplify the game's crazier side.\n\n\nPROS\n+ Fantastic diversity and balance among weapons, items, and enemies \n+ Mechanically solid:  Easy to pick up, but harder to master.\n+ Solid pixel-art style\n+ Couch co-op\n+ Very responsive developer\n\nCONS\n- Strange technical issues in conjunction with Nvidia Optimus\n- Limited assortment of game modes\n- Level design and aesthetics can get too \"samey\" after a while", "timestamp_created": 1481769610, "timestamp_updated": 1481932782, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513460", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28265334": {"recommendationid": "28265334", "author": {"steamid": "76561198137298709", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 8443, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511455113}, "language": "english", "review": "The art is gorgeous.

Basically a fleet of alien ships found Earth and completely annihilated the entire planet except for 3 fleets of spaceships which managed to escape while carrying humans in cryostasis.\n\nDespite Humanity\u2019s best efforts in order to preserve our species the aliens still manage to track down the fleets and are now attempting to destroy our last hope of survival. You play as one of several robots which were tasked of safeguarding these last humans and you\u2019re the only thing able to prevent Humankind extinction.\n\n[b][u]Gameplay:[/u][/b]\n\nAs for the game itself, it features 3 different difficulty settings which you can unlock by beating the game in the hardest difficulty available. You can play either the endless mode, once you unlock it, or the \u201cstory mode\u201d which is divided into 3 different galaxies, each corresponding to one of the 3 different fleets and each galaxy consists of 4 levels with the last level having a boss. If you beat all the 3 bosses it\u2019s game over and you win, simple as that. The game does offer local co-op but I\u2019ve not been able to test it out, it\u2019s a shame there is no online or some sort of leaderboard system though.\n\nAs far as I can tell the levels are not procedural generated, the game just picks one from a pool of handcrafted maps. However, each level can be played in a different way, sometimes you have to eliminate all enemies while other times you have to carry fuel tanks from one side of the map to the other in order to power the hyper drive to complete the mission. Each level can also have some machines that after a certain period of time can give you either a new weapon, a new type of explosives or HP. There are also crates that can spawn at the beginning of a level which can contain certain perks such as, double jump, dash, dodge, increased fire rate, etc. Overall the weapon variety is enough to keep a satisfying experience by having weapons such as a RPG, a lightsaber, shotgun, among others but I do wish the game had some unique and silly weapons that could potentially make things a lot more fun. As for the enemy variety, I think there\u2019s plenty of it in order to keep the game a challenge, especially when there\u2019s this certain machine which boost the enemies making them bigger and more powerful.\n\nNow, in theory each level is pretty short and one playthrough could easily be accomplished in under half an hour but the more you play the more things get interesting because you\u2019ll unlock new enemy types, new items and weapons that you can choose as starting gear as well as new robots to play as. That said, due to the fact that a single run is rather short, especially if you die in the first levels, the game has that \u201cone more\u201d feel to it. The game does start slow but as you progress through the levels the speed of the game ramps up and the game goes from this slow paced shooting platformer to a very fast paced and hectic one, and I guess that\u2019s one of the things I really like about it.\n\n[h1][b][u]Conclusion:[/u][/b][/h1]\n\nAll in all, Super Mutant Alien Assault is a very solid Super Crate Box clone that brings some new mechanics to the formula which can either appeal you or not, depending on how you like these kinds of games. Despite having a fair good amount of time with the game, I do wish there were more galaxies, unlockables and map layouts or even a little more focus on the story side of the game to keep me coming back to it every now and then, I also think a level editor and Steam Workshop would benefit this game greatly. And, while I do like the pixel art style I can\u2019t really say the same for the soundtrack, even though it seems to be praised by others it just isn\u2019t my thing.\n\n[h1]If you enjoyed Super Crate Box or if you\u2019re looking for a shooting platformer with tight controls and very simplistic gameplay with enough enemy and weapon variety, as well as unlockables, to keep things interesting, I definitely recommend you check this one out.[/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1473093180, "timestamp_updated": 1473093364, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.613712", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25325386": {"recommendationid": "25325386", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068342703", "num_games_owned": 6, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 169, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470243506}, "language": "english", "review": "Super Mutant Alien Assault is a fun, tense, action game with a great dubstep soundtrack, but it\u2019s an extremely short experience.

The pixel art style is beyond awesome with the environments and the enemy designs being really cool.  \n\nThe soundtrack is also really sweet, with techno and dubstep music accompanying the fast and tense gameplay. It might not be everyone's cup of tea, but I personally loved it and I think you will too.\n\nThe game has three galaxies to go through and each one of them is 4 levels long. All levels are randomly generated and when you die the levels will reset into something new which is a very welcome addition.  To unlock the higher difficulties you will have to play through the game without dying once (which I wasn't able to do) so people who want replay value will have a lot to go through. \n\nBut people who don't like that big of a challenge don't worry, because after you unlock a galaxy you can start the game from whatever galaxy you want.\n\nThe game took me 1 hour to complete the three galaxies, but there's a lot of stuff to do. As mentioned before you can go and play through it without dying and there's also endless mode where you can put your skills to the test and try to survive as long as possible.\n\nI didn't encounter any problems with the game whatsoever. It ran smoothly from beginning to end, so I doubt any of you will encounter any problems.\n\nSuper Mutant Alien Assault is incredibly fun and is definitely a game I will come back to in the future. It's incredibly fun and without a doubt the best Super Crate Box type of game I've played to date.\n\nPros:\n+ Insanely Fun\n+ Great Soundtrack\n+ Awesome pixel art style\n\nCons:\n-  Only Three galaxies \n\n8.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1468447774, "timestamp_updated": 1468447774, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.573970", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24298410": {"recommendationid": "24298410", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014198791", "num_games_owned": 516, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 295, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468801991}, "language": "english", "review": "1.

I watched it in EA and was tempted to buy it on many occasions but I held off and waited for the full release.  I'm really happy I waited as the final product is quite good. Of course I was immediately reminded of Super Crate Box as the core gameplay similarities are  quite obvious.  At first play I will admit SMAA felt slower paced and quite easy in comparison to SCB but after a bit more gametime it started to blossom.  Beat the first difficulty level (which was extremely easy) and now the game has become fairly challenging on the second of three difficulty levels.  Mutitudes of items and weapons left to to unlock as well as an extremely challenging endless mode with leaderboards will keep the game fresh for awhile. :-)  Oh..and the soundtrack is  quite interesting as well.

As somebody who loved super crate box, I've been looking for a single screen puzzle-shooter to top it since. And well, SMAA is almost a contender. Almost.\n\nTouting itself as \"The Citzen Kane of Super Crate Box Clones\", joke or not, admittedly got my expectations up. The gameplay looked promising from the trailers, so I decided to pounce on it immediately. While the hype and love started oozing from every one of my pores as soon as I started playing, the well dried up pretty fast of my enjoyment. There seems to be a soulless void... an emptiness, to this game. And, I'm dedicating the rest of the review to try and figure it out for myself using self-talk therapy.\n\nFirstly the positives:\n\nThe graphics are very good. The gibs of the enemies are crunchy, and remind me a lot of shooting a rocket or super shotgun at some cacodemons in doom. It's very satisfying when you chunk a cluster of flying enemies with a rocket launcher, or snipe a particularly troublesome foe in the head with a sniper rifle. The spaceship's designs are all very pretty, and every enemy is thought out aesthetically to match their obvious functions.\n\nThe gimmicks it's added to distance itself from crate box are also unique and interesting. Monsters mutate not only in speed, but now in function- they grow larger, gain extra abilities, and sometimes can even reach more than one stage. There are now grenades and special abilities added to the mix, which can be powered by the radiation gathered from upgraded monsters. This means you can choose to upgrade some monsters for some special ability ammo if you wish! There are different types of levels, making your goal from each vary.\n\nBut now for the negatives:\n\nAfter deliberating the issue with SMAA in my head, I've realized it all comes down to the game's speed. A game like this doesn't need to be fast to be enjoyable, but when a game is both fast and slow at the same time the action begins to clash and create friction between the different elements. \n\nTo sum it up in an allegory: Super Mutant Alien Assault is like making Usain Bolt hit a huge rock with a pickaxe. You can sprint around the rock smashing it all you want, but at the end of the day, you're doing long tedious work and have to keep running around in circles to get the job done. In super crate box, you shoot fast, deal lots of damage, but die fast. This is because super crate box is a high score based arcade game, so it's just skill that lets you get further. However, SMAA has changed the genre to sort of a roguelike room clearing game, and has to be rebalanced to fit that. Therefore, this fast movement based game has now been refitted to pump in more gimmicks, include player health bars, ways to stall, more player power... And to balance it out, more enemy health. Now the game runs a whole lot slower, and since the movement is about the same, feels a whole lot clunkier as a result. Sound familiar?\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXQ2lO3ieBA\n\nTo quickly wrap up the other things I have problems with:\n\nThe music needs to calm down. This is a minor gripe because I can just mute it, but based on the new speed of the game... Loud aggressive dubstep music just doesn't work. It sounds like every second of my game should just be some call of duty montage on youtube, even if I'm just sitting around waiting for enemies to spawn. I just muted it after a while. This is pretty much personal opinion and I don't factor it into my review, but thought I should mention it.\n\nThe slowdown effects are tied to framerate. That means that whenever the game wants to dramatically slow down time, it reduces the framerate directly. This is extremely distracting, and text cannot justify how much it hurts to look at. I don't know if the engine itself is responsible for this, but I seriously hope it will be patched eventually.\n\nOverall, while not all terrible, I still cannot recommend SMAA because I find Super Crate Box to be way more enjoyable for free instead of 8 dollars. If this game was the first of it's kind with nothing to compare to, maybe I'd say it's worth the price, but honestly there have been games that have done it better before for lower prices and/or free.", "timestamp_created": 1468387102, "timestamp_updated": 1468387301, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.539964", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24281037": {"recommendationid": "24281037", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054395540", "num_games_owned": 637, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 259, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468350449}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "SMAA \u00e9 um jogo bem divertido de a\u00e7\u00e3o fren\u00e9tica (e m\u00fasica fren\u00e9tica) que pode ser jogado com at\u00e9 dois jogadores no mesmo computador. \u00c9 dif\u00edcil pra porra, mas vale a pena se distrair nesse jogo com a vibe retro.\nO unico ruim \u00e9 que \u00e9 bem repetitivo depois de um tempo :s\n\nAnalise completa: http://gonbrasil.com.br/2016/07/12/jogamos-super-mutant-alien-assault/", "timestamp_created": 1468352333, "timestamp_updated": 1468352333, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24271263": {"recommendationid": "24271263", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003624430", "num_games_owned": 124, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 401, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496469340}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is literally crack.

I don't think much more of a preview is required for this title but sure, lets do this. Super Mutant Alien Assault is gaming popcorn, it's delicious, fun, and probably bad for your heart. All jokes aside, the game is EXTREMELY well put together for an early access title. The level design, controls, and aesthetics of the game are all very sharp and pleasing. The games concept is rather simple but highly replayable. Kill monsters, make it as far as you can, unlock more stuff that makes the game even more fun, rinse and repeat. This gameplay leads to the \"One more game\" syndrome. Making it hard to put down at times. Throw in co-op with a friend and suddenly your blasting away hours of aliens. Now like other arcade games Super Mutant Alien Assault doesn't necessarily have much staying power. It's a pick up and play type of game and then come back later after you've played something else. That isn't a bad thing, it's a familiar type of game that is welcoming and guaranteed fun. Just keep this in mind. The  awesome part?

Still in early access, the cons are compensated for by the pros. Recommended for those who enjoy a challange or over the top mindless gunplay.\n\n\nPros\n1. Gorgeous flowing pixel art style\n2. Controls are crisp and tight\n3. Excellent weapon variery and distinction\n\nCons\n1. Lack of online co-op\n2. The game feels a little short\n\n\nPro 1: Gorgeous flowing pixel art style\nSMAA is presented in a high quality pixel art style that evokes the feel of classic 16-bit games. Like other games of a similar style, such as Bleed, Shovel Knight, and They Bleed Pixels, SMAA's art style works well with the game design. Every alien's design is distinct and it is easy to distinguish an interactable item from background scenery.  \n\nPro 2: Controls are crisp and tight\nSMAA shines in its control scheme. The options allow for keyboard control, and native support for XBOX controllers or gamepads with X mode support. The majority of controls are rebindable to your own comfort. The robots respond perfectly to your commands, with no noticable lag or over/understeering. They attack when you tell them, and move where you direct. Given the game's frantic nature, a tight smooth control scheme is a necessity, and SMAA delivers perfectly. When you make a mistake, you will not be able to blame poor controls.\n\nPro 3: Excellent weapon variery and distinction\nA major component of SMAA is the selection of weapons avaliable for your use. With weapons ranging from a simple short ranged shiv to pistols, AK-47 assault rifles, miniguns, grenades, to exotic unique ones like the plasma pogostick, every weapon comes with its own strengths and weaknesses, but most importantly, they all feel unique. Shotguns have spread effects, sniper rifles can pierce through multiple aliens at once. The more you play the game, the more weapons are unlocked for use. Special abilities and defence moves round out your combat skills, giving you the tools to handle even the largest boss fights.\n\n\nCon 1: Lack of online co-op\nSMAA's greatest flaw is its lack of LAN or online co-op support. Only local co-op is supported, meaning that both players must be physically present in order to play. While this is not a major issue for those who enjoy such activities with friends, Online co-op would provide greater variety and competition.\n\n2. The game feels a little short\nSMAA has four main gameplay modes spread out across 12 levels. Each level takes 1-2 minutes to complete, so a full playthrough of all 3 galaxies can be done in about 20 minutes. While great for the causal player, those who are looking to unlock everything will quickly find themselves playing through the same stages and fighting the same bosses over and over. Increasing the number of potential boss creatures, or randomizing the order in which you encounter them would help to reduce repetition.\n\n\nConclusions\nOverall, SMAA is a perfect example of a small team indy game developed with a clear goal in mind. So long as it's fun and enjoyable, it doesn't have to offer a unique game experience, and SMAA delivers on the promise of fun. Tightly focused, it knows what it wants to achieve and sets out to do it without adding in excess baggage. \n\nHighly recommended when on sale.", "timestamp_created": 1441537322, "timestamp_updated": 1441537322, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "17808698": {"recommendationid": "17808698", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072255649", "num_games_owned": 2191, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 269, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1440887108}, "language": "schinese", "review": "Flash \u6e38\u620f Mutant Alien Assault  \u7684\u52a0\u5f3a\u7248\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u8bf4\u662fEA\u4f46\u5b8c\u6210\u5ea6\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u9ad8\u3002\u6e38\u620f\u5728\u9650\u65f6\u5b88\u5173\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u4e00\u4e9b\u65b0\u7684\u73a9\u6cd5\uff0c\u52a0\u4e0a\u4e0d\u540c\u6b66\u5668\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u6253\u6cd5\u6e38\u620f\u4e50\u8da3\u975e\u5e38\u591a\u3002\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u91c7\u7528\u968f\u7740\u6e38\u620f\u9010\u6b65\u89e3\u9501\u7684\u673a\u5236\u6765\u589e\u52a0\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u96be\u5ea6\u548c\u4e30\u5bcc\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u6bd4\u5982\u65b0\u7684\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u65b0\u7684\u6b66\u5668\uff0c\u65b0\u7684\u654c\u4eba\u7b49\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u6bcf\u6b21\u73a9\u90fd\u4f1a\u589e\u52a0\u65b0\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u548c\u4e50\u8da3\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1441009757, "timestamp_updated": 1441009757, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513324", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "17764768": {"recommendationid": "17764768", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034390687", "num_games_owned": 26, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1255, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1466095890}, "language": "english", "review": "Can't get enough of this game.

The countless stream of unlocks means there was always something more to see and experience with every attempt at surviving each playthrough. All the while, dubstep beats playing in the background added to my nearly overloaded senses.\n\nThe game is challenging and offers even more of a challenge with higher, unlockable difficulty modes. Although, I would have liked to see a couple of these difficulties unlocked by default.\n\nTight, simple controls allowed me to jump into the action with ease, giving me room to improve and attempt to master more advanced movement and positioning. It was a lot of fun zipping along levels using the dash ability.\n\nIt's no secret I really enjoy the game, however I would have loved to enjoy it with online friends \u2013 the lack of online multi-player is a bit of a letdown. Having said that, single-player is packed full of content to unlock and experience, including an endless mode for those wanting to play the game forever. Just a word of warning, it can get a tad repetitive.\n\nSuper Mutant Alien Assault offers a lot of content in a small package. Tight controls, a beautiful pixel art aesthetic, and intense and challenging gameplay make this a buy in my opinion.

So far, i'd have to say it's very good, and the fact that it's only early access atm, excites me even more. Because this means even more things will be added to this awesome game! And unlike some developers, I can say for a fact this game has been tested properly by the devs. I haven't ran into any bugs or lack of content in the game yet and it hasen't gotten old. I'll be able to give a better review soon after my recording session with this game. So keep an eye out for the gameplay video I'll be posting! Also... go buy the game already and stop reading the review!!!\n\n\nSomething to note. This game is currently only local multiplayer (to be expected), but thats fine.

A secondary weapon which is weaker, but a good back up plan for when your primary weapon runs out, and the weapon dispenser isn't recharged. Sometimes you might get defensive gadgets like a dash ability, or a perk which allows you to double jump.\n\nThe music is really cool. It does a great job at pumping your adrenaline as you try to survive as long as possible through different enemy waves and bosses.\n\nIf you enjoyed Super Crate Box, I'd definitely recommend this. \nIf you never tried Super Crate Box, I'd say try this game anyway.\n\nOverall, a lot of fun!", "timestamp_created": 1440112689, "timestamp_updated": 1440114747, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 32, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.634316", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}}}

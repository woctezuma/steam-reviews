Everytime you \"attack\" a monster you lose some health, and everytime you move over a health pack you restore health. As you collect experience while you progress through the increasily difficult dungeon floors, you level up, causing the amount of health you have to increase, providing an incentive to maximum the experience you gain on each floor. While this may sound like a simple concept, there are enough secondary mechanics, interesting monster behaviours, and challenging trade-offs you must make to keep the gameplay varied and interesting. If you lose all your health or spent too long on a level, the ghost will appear to keep you on your toes. This provides a very fast-paced gameplay, while forcing you to pay careful attention to every move you make, even if there is an undo command.\n\nUnfortunately, the game is not without its flaws. The ghost can be an annoyance to those who want to take their time, or experiment without worry of having to start all over again.

You gain items and health for doing earlier floors better, so performance on early floors affects your ability on later ones, and even when you can't figure out the perfect solution you're always pressured to do as well as you possibly can.\n\nThe randomly generated levels will occasionally throw you a floor you can wipe in one try out of instinct, and occasionally something that has you completely stuck, which can be demoralizing near the end of a good run. There's also a timer on each level, which I guess is there to make sure you can't be TOO cautious, but getting wrecked by a ghost when you're 3/4ths of the way through a tricky level can feel frustrating all the same.

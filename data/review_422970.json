Grafica fotorealistica, sopraffazione dei sensi, possibilit\u00e0 di gioco multi-stratificate, achievement che richiedono decine se non centinaia di ore di dedizione...\n\nParallelamente esiste un altro filone, composta da giochi solitamente (ma non necessariamente) afferenti al settore indipendente, che invece vanno in una direzione completamente opposta, dove tutte le componenti del gioco sono estremamente sintetiche e rivolte alla purezza del game design. Questo di solito si traduce in un'estetica molto ricercata, in possibilit\u00e0 di gioco pi\u00f9 ridotte ma anche molto pi\u00f9 particolari, in un approccio al gameplay molto pi\u00f9 adulto, diretto, senza fronzoli.\n\n[i]Devil Daggers[/i] \u00e8 assolutamente uno dei capisaldi di questa categoria.\n\nIl gameplay \u00e8 ridotto all'osso: sei in un'arena, piatta e finita, e arrivano orde di mostri, orde che tra l'altro non sono casuali ma sono procedurali. Se uno di loro ti tocca, muori. Devi semplicemente star l\u00ec e farli fuori tutti. Hai una sola arma con due modalit\u00e0 di fuoco; se resisti abbastanza arrivi a sbloccarne una terza di dubbia utilit\u00e0. E quando muori il gioco \u00e8 finito: non puoi fare altro che ricominciare e cercare di resistere pi\u00f9 a lungo. Il gioco tiene traccia del tempo che sei riuscito a sopravvivere, ti mostra il tuo record, e ti ficca una classifica nella quale puoi vedere i risultati globali, quel che hanno fatto i tuoi amici, e i replay del risultato migliore di tutti quanti.\n\nBasta, il gioco sta tutto qui. In cinque minuti hai gi\u00e0 visto tutto. Anzi, in cinque minuti ti sei gi\u00e0 fatto dieci partite perch\u00e8 il tuo record di sopravvivenza \u00e8 di quaranta secondi.\n\nQuesta sorta di gameplay minimale come un pallottola, freddo e sintetico come un colpo d'accetta, \u00e8 peraltro condito da una grafica assolutamente allucinata: un 3D ricoperto di una finta pixel-art che rimanda a certi grandi nomi del passato tipo [i]Doom[/i], coi quali per la verit\u00e0 il gameplay non ha nulla a che vedere ma che evidentemente fa partire un qualche tipo di associazione mentale con un periodo nel quale andavano di moda giochi molto pi\u00f9 [i]arcade[/i] di oggi. Da questi il gioco eredita anche il font, che \u00e8 credo lo stesso che veniva usato in certi giochi tipo [i]Risky Woods[/i]. E poi ci sono i mostri, che sono mucchi di teschi di varie forme e composizioni, mescolati con delle cose tentacolose e insettose di netta impronta pulp; in generale sembra di trovarsi dentro ad un incubo acido inspiegabile e allucinante.\n\n[i]Devil Daggers[/i] viene tra l'altro, a ragione, applaudito per il suo geniale design sonoro: a parte la parvenza di colonna sonora, che sembra essere pure quella una specie di memoria marcia uscita da un Soundblaster dei primi '90 e rimessa in sesto con strumentazioni moderne, gli effetti sonori hanno un'importanza assoluta all'interno del gameplay. Molto pi\u00f9 che in altri sparatutto \u00e8 infatti importantissimo tenere le orecchie tese per riconoscere quali nemici stiano arrivando e da dove, perch\u00e8 tutti emettono suoni diversi - dal battere i denti al tamburellare le proprie dita insettose sul terreno - e alcuni di essi hanno percorsi altamente prevedibili che \u00e8 necessario tenersi a mente per evitare di camminare guardandosi continuamente alle spalle.\n\nInsomma, [i]Devil Daggers[/i] da una parte \u00e8 l'anti-sparatutto per eccellenza, \u00e8 la negazione pi\u00f9 plateale di tutto quanto verso il quale il genere si sia mosso nel corso degli ultimi trent'anni. E parallelamente \u00e8 per\u00f2 lo sparatutto perfetto, quello pi\u00f9 unico, quello pi\u00f9 impeccabile e privo di sbavature, quello che o lo ami o lo odi, ma se lo odi lo odi non perch\u00e8 ti fa ca**re, lo odi perch\u00e8 sai che \u00e8 semplicemente qualcosa con il quale tu non hai niente a che spartire, un po' come la pancetta a colazione, che s\u00ec, fa bene, per\u00f2 poi ti fa anche schifo perch\u00e8 tu a colazione sei stato cresciuto col caff\u00e8 e il toast con marmellata, no?

These skulls are relentless in their pursuit of you. You need to stay moving and look around at all times or you'll turn around into a wall of bouncing bone. Most attempts last less than a minute, because once you get hit that's it. You're sent to the leaderboard, but you can get back to the game with a click of the retry.\n\nShooting is easy, hold down the mouse button and a steady stream of dagger bullets will flow from your hand. Press the mouse button and they will shotgun out in a fat burst of projectiles. The problem with that is I was never able to consistently fire that shotgun burst after 40 minutes, so I just never used it. The enemies are always on top of you. Enemies take a bit of damage before they dissipate and they'll turn a bright orange when low on health. What's that... an easy mode where enemies have less health? No... welcome to the pit, you were sent here to die.\n\nIts a needlessly difficult game, a bit unfair, there is no warning you're about to die from a wall of skulls other than you know enemies will always be on top of you. That's just the arcade nature of it. If you don't want to put up with that, then this clearly isn't the game for you. Because you can just get right back into the thick of it, there's no sort of lost progress. You have what you have going in as you will have when you die.\n\nWhile most first person shooters waste time on levels and enemy variety, Devil Daggers keeps it simple. You are here. You will never leave here. You will run around in an infinite circle bull fighting enemies until you die. Towers will crop up to spawn enemies. Usually one burst pours a dozen or so skulls with a secondary horned skull that does laps. These horned skulls drop gems. Destroying enemy towers will dislodge red gems. When you stop shooting, the gems get pulled toward you.  Collecting gems will eventually upgrade how many daggers you can shoot.\n\nDevil Daggers puts forth a convincing environment and great sound design. Other than that, if you have seen a minute of it, you have seen the game. Sure more enemies happen, but there's little variety here when even the most basic enemy will kill you dead.\n\nWith all the frustration and aggravation, its still a tough game to put down as you're dumped right back into the game with nothing lost.

This is an arcade-type game where the goal is to survive for as many seconds as you can, resulting in a higher leaderboard position. As for the end-goal of the game, if you survive for a really long time, you'll be awarded with the game's sole achievement, perhaps the ultimate bragging-right.\nThe gameplay is relatively simple. You only have two weapons: a shotgun-blast of daggers(single clicks) and a rapid-fire stream of daggers (holding down the mouse button). You die from touching anything, and most enemies' method of attack is to either chase you or act as obstacles you can accidentally run into. Most enemies are faster than you if moving in a straight line, so part of playing well is to frequently make tight turns so that most enemies have a tougher time catching up to you. Like many classic FPS games, you can bunnyhop to increase your speed and fire a blast at the floor to propel yourself into the air. These abilities can sometimes get you out of tight situations. Certain enemies drop red gems, and if you stop shooting for a few seconds you can attract any gems toward you. At certain amounts of gems collected, you gain firepower.\nThe difficulty gives intense satisfaction when you finally beat your or a freind's high score, even if by just a few seconds. Despite how hard it is, the mechanics of the game are so well-refined that no deaths ever feel unfair or cheap. That's not to say that you won't get frustrated with yourself if you're having a bad session.\nThe artstyle is also really cool; it has a dark PSX/early-3D look to it. That in addition to the fantastic sound design and lighting effects make this game really stand out as something unique.\nIf you enjoyed Doom, its 2016 reboot or other fast-paced FPS classics and want something simple, challenging and addictive to play at the drop of a hat, I highly recommend Devil Daggers.", "timestamp_created": 1511403499, "timestamp_updated": 1511403499, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36898318": {"recommendationid": "36898318", "author": {"steamid": "76561198142358657", "num_games_owned": 157, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 503, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511403441}, "language": "english", "review": "this game is v good, and v spicy. overall v good/10", "timestamp_created": 1511403365, "timestamp_updated": 1511403489, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519833", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36896306": {"recommendationid": "36896306", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064948141", "num_games_owned": 204, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 269, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511402449}, "language": "english", "review": "Devil Daggers harks back to arcade games of old.

There is only one level and your job is to do one thing: Survive. Doing just that is by no means an easy task as the average play session (at least for me) lasts only about a minute to a minute and a half (if even that, might feel longer with everything it throws at you). As soon as you die, you are met with a leaderboard showing how long you lasted that time as well as others, which is of course, standard. BUT, it also gives you the option to watch the replays of all the players on said leaderboard, so if you find yourself getting stuck in one particular section you might be able to learn how to better deal with a scenario from studying the higher ranked players, i absolutely love this feature.

You'll feel so much momentum and power in this game!\n\nAs you start to get farther and farther, more challenging enemies like spiders, bigger skulls, more spawners and even centepedes come out of the abyss to kill you. But there is a learning curve to this game because the same enemies will appear at an allocated time. \n\nSo as you make it to (120 seconds) a centepede appears, and at first you'll think to yourself (HOW DO I EVEN KILL THIS THING!) But the more you make it to that time the more you'll be able to practice that segment. It's like a system that pulls you in because you have to work hard to even be able to practice and I assure you the reward of progression is so satisfying!\n\nAnother very cool feature is that you get red gems that increase your firepower, making both your machine gun and shotgun shoot more daggers at a time. And once you get the 3rd upgrade, (70 Gems) you can fire homing daggers that OBLITHERATE everything on the stage. (Almost everything)\n\nThe game lets you keep track of your friends scores, with results being uploaded in real time, and you can even watch replays of your friends instantly.\n\nMe and my friend are probably trying to beat each others scores as you're reading this review. \n\nJust get this game please, it's an awesome time waster that is so addicting.

Per quanto agili e reattivi, inevitabilmente prima o poi subiremo un colpo, nel qual caso dopo una schermata riassuntiva con tempi, punteggi e statistiche dovremo ricominciare tutto da capo.\n\nUn vecchio detto recita che \"il Diavolo \u00e8 nei dettagli\", e questo gioco sembra esserne la prova lampante. Per quanto sia concettualmente semplice (spara ad ogni cosa che si muove, schiva quello che non riesci ad uccidere), alla prova dei fatti senza la giusta preparazione le prime partite si concluderanno in una manciata di secondi con dei sonori fallimenti e un crescente senso di frustrazione. Con una buona dose di pazienza e tanta, tantissima pratica riusciremo piano piano a migliorare il nostro score: il gioco NON \u00e8 battibile, quindi la voglia di superare il proprio record e scalare le classifiche di Steam diventa necessariamente il solo e unico stimolo a proseguire.\n\nLe immagini piuttosto sgranate ci riportano all'epoca dei primi rendering 3D, rievocando in una certa misura lo stile di QUAKE; il motore grafico di Devil Daggers \u00e8 leggero e performante, con framerate granitico anche nei frangenti pi\u00f9 caotici. Gli effetti sonori (risate demoniache, sospiri, versi animaleschi) sono tutti di ottima fattura, e l'audio direzionale da il grande vantaggio di poter stabilire con anticipo la direzione di arrivo dei nemici, anticipandone le mosse; in quest'ottica il peso dell'assenza di un soundtrack vero e proprio non si fa assolutamente sentire.\n\nE' difficile NON consigliare Devil Daggers, ma al tempo stesso bisogna riconoscere che si tratta di un prodotto di nicchia, diretto ai veri appassionati di FPS old-school e in particolar modo a quella player base hardcore che ama misurarsi con livelli di difficolt\u00e0 proibitivi. Se vi riconoscete in una di queste categorie e non avete ancora provato Devil Daggers dovete assolutamente rimediare: vi state perdendo uno degli FPS arcade pi\u00f9 adrenalinici e skill-demanding di sempre. In caso contrario, statene alla larga: frustrazione e rabbia sono sempre dietro l'angolo, e senza la giusta spinta il gioco perde subito gran parte del proprio appeal.\n\n[i][b]Se questa recensione ti \u00e8 piaciuta clicca \"Segui\" sulla [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/retrogamingcafe/curation]pagina del Curatore[/url] del mio gruppo: sarai sempre aggiornato con i miei personali consigli e le recensioni dei migliori titoli indie/retro/roguelite in circolazione![/b][/i]", "timestamp_created": 1508347266, "timestamp_updated": 1508347364, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.658849", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35786692": {"recommendationid": "35786692", "author": {"steamid": "76561198273779653", "num_games_owned": 108, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1054, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505447066}, "language": "english", "review": "So good.

You go to them and...\nYou die.\nSo you start again and try run after run to beat your record until the last guy finsihed with loading (LoL or something like that) and you close the game.\n\nThe Goal?\nSurvive as long as you can.\nHow?\nShoot the Skulls that are flying around but dont touch'em!\nWhy?\nI dont know man you get a dagger but you can't stab anyone.\n\nWhat i like about the game:\nIf I'm bored i just go to Library Start the game do 10-15 Rounds and close the game. Its not really a game that you play 4 Hours straight.\nIt has a really cool art Style.\nThe game isnt going in that deep, like Binding of Isaac, where you find Items, have to clear rooms, have a Story. No its just pressing play and start shooting.\n\nWhat i dont like about the game:\n300M/B download size? I mean its not that much but for comparison, Spintires only has 500M/B and its full 3D game with more than just one Map.\nThere is only one Map, one gamemode, no Support for modding (atleast i didnt see any mods).\n\nSo is it worth the 5\u20ac?

If you say the first-person market is oversaturated, you may be making an understatement. Some of the most popular games of this decade and this past few years were first person shooters. Devil Daggers is different; instead of killing yet another group of terrorists in games like Counter-Strike or Insurgency, or killing space aliens in Halo or Destiny, Devil Daggers focuses on skill and takes you back to the days of Doom and Quake.\n\nDevil Daggers is a fast-paced shooter set in hell and makes you face \u2018endless legions of demons\u2019. The movement is incredibly fast and your weapons are throwable daggers. While there are only 13 types of enemies, every round feels different and unique. This game will make you feel frustrated and angry, but you come to back to it for another round. \n\nI recommend you play this game with headphones because this game is terrifying.

Do you wish you could shoot knives out of your hand so fast it looks like a polygonal flamethrower?\u00a0\n\nAlso, do you not mind dying?\n\nDevil Daggers is a really simple game. It honestly is just shoot things until you die; that's the entire game. The tricky bit is to last as long as possible without dying, which is so much easier to say than to do. The longest round of Devil Daggers I've had was around 2 minutes, and that took a lot of effort and practice. In fact, the only achievement in the game asks you to survive \u00a0500 seconds, or 8 minutes and 20 seconds. At the time of this writing, 0.1% of all players of Devil Daggers have managed 500 seconds.\n\nThis literal hell of shoot, die, repeat is still very engaging though. It's based on Arena shooters of old (in particular it reminds me of Quake) that featured mechanics like Strafe Jumping to build up speed and \"rocket\" jumping, and keeping an older looking demonic vibe to all the enemies.\n\nWhich fits well. The Vantablack level of darkness frames a stone platform, where all the shooting happens. Over the course of a run, specific enemies will spawn in and around the platform, screaming and screeching to life in a horrifying way. Devil Daggers is definitely best played with headphones on, since the expertly engineered audio is not only immersive and terrible to behold, but absolutely essential in pinpointing where enemies are coming from. This, combined with tight controls and simple shooting mechanics mean that players are easily sucked into the dark abyss that is Devil Daggers.\n\nSo what lives down there in the dark? As soon as you pick up your dagger, the game throws all kinds of horrible things at you; chattering hordes of skulls, floating spiders, gargantuan centipedes... there are 13 enemy types in all, but they all work together beautifully. Enemies in Devil Daggers will always spawn at certain time periods, meaning that (with practice) you can predict what's coming next and how to handle them. It's insanely well tuned, and absolutely brutally hard to overcome without being obtuse. Repeated attempts see improvement, and players that pay attention and learn the rhythms of the game can get pretty far in.\n\nTo help the player, you can upgrade your base weapon by collecting red stones from dead enemies. So long as you're not firing, the stones travel directly to the player, so good play requires knowing when you need to shoot, and when you need to get precious stones. With enough of the things, players get an improved weapon; faster firing rates, more damage, and eventually a panic button that fires homing daggers all over the place. It's a simple mechanic that requires practice to really get the hang of, since too much time spent collecting stones means time spent not shooting, and time not spent shooting is time enough for the hordes you're facing to overwhelm you.\n\nThe reward for all this\u00a0is minimal, though. If you're not into arcade-style high scores and competition, then Devil Daggers will be an absolute waste. The entire point of the game is surviving the longest you possibly can, and if leaderboards or personal bests aren't your thing, then this game isn't for you; but if that type of masochism appeals to your tastes, then guess what? This game is literally built for specifically that.\n\nIn order to help players learn, Devil Daggers saves the replays of a player's personal best, and makes them available to everyone for viewing.

Very much so.\n\nWhat Devil Daggers does offer to the player is a seamless FPS survival arena with incredibly tight 90's-era controls, immense replayability, enchanting and original graphics, and some of the absolute best sound design I've ever heard in a video game.\n\n**Controls & Game Flow**\nAnyone who grew up with or even simply played a game like Quake or Doom knows that when it comes to movement, what is realistic is not always fun. Many modern titles include realistic movement speed, reloading, little to no jumping, and the ability to interact with objects (stopping the flow). Quake was not like this. Quake rewarded the player for taking advantage of the engine by bunny-hopping and strafing, and DOOM never interrupted the action with cutscenes or reloading. Devil Daggers would be nothing without tight controls, and it's safe to say that it actually *improved* on the high-skill-ceiling controls of 90's-FPS titles (mastering modern mechanics such as the \"rocket jump\"). Like a bullet hell, your actual hitbox is very small, smaller than you think it is. The pinpoint-precision occasionally demanded by Devil Daggers is one of its biggest strengths. \n\n**Replayability & Advancement**\nThere are no permanent upgrades in Devil Daggers. Only your skill will save you. The challenge offered to the player, as well as the golden, elusive reward of the DEVIL DAGGER achievement (the one and only achievement, achieved by a mere 98 people at the time of writing) provides a scenario where playing and replaying are encouraged, and doing so will really open up opportunity to get better at the game, keeping you constantly challenging your Personal Best.\n\n**Visual & Audio Design**\nAethetically and functionally, both the graphical and audio design are stellar. You can see how precise and minimalist the graphics are from the trailers. While minimalist, the eerie pixelated visuals of Devil Daggers manage to be very unique to the title. But the department in which the game really shines is its audio design. Every enemy makes a unique sound, easily recognizable, and thanks to the game's simulated 3D-surround sound capabilities, with headphones on you can determine the location and distance of enemies based solely on sound, and do so consistently. Situational and spatial awareness are absolutely essential in Devil Daggers, and the sound design keeps no information from you in this regard. Hearing is truly just as important as seeing in this game, and no other FPS I've played has been able to say the same.\n\n**Conclusion**\nFor $4.99, Devil Daggers is definitely worth your time. Even though the majority of us will in all likelihood never \"beat\" the game, Devil Daggers is about the adventure, the constant pursuit of that end goal. And in this pursuit the game really shines.", "timestamp_created": 1504871997, "timestamp_updated": 1504872074, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34812123": {"recommendationid": "34812123", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078723723", "num_games_owned": 298, "num_reviews": 140, "playtime_forever": 173, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502431552}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun at first, and is still ocassionaly entertaining to mindlessly shoot, but quickly becomes old as it's simple to a fault.

The sound design is incredible. I can literally dance my way backwards through a crowd of enemies knowing who and where they are by sound alone. The graphics are low-res, but the art design is excellent and the whole thing just feels creepier because of the vague definition around the pixels on my 1080P monitor. And the controls are so tight you'll feel like a demon god as you climb the (admittedly high) difficulty curve. The longest I can last is a couple minutes even when I'm in top form, but I know every time I die that it was my fault, and the game allows for some incredibly tight maneuvers if you can pull them off. It's like some wierd lovechild of DOOM and Ubermosh, and I love it to pieces.\n\n[b]TL;DR[/b]\nThis game has its creepy, satanic mood down perfectly. This game has its very high skill curve down perfectly. This game has its combination of frustration and addictiveness down perfectly.

While each enemy is programmed to behave in a certain way, the sheer volume of Lovecraftian horrors that spawn in the arena makes keeping track of them difficult, ensuring that the player is always kept on their toes. Thanks to the incredible sound design, each enemy has its own distinctive sound, which is necessary with the first person perspective to keep track of the arena.\n\nIf that sounds difficult, it's because it is- the game tasks the player with surviving for as long as possible, then uploads players' best times to a global leaderboard. The world record currently stands at a little over 1000 seconds, which equates to around 17 minutes. Most players' average campaign time will be between 45 and 60 seconds, with the game's only achievement being offered to the 0.1% of players that manage to survive for 500 seconds or more.

Something about them never seemed all that appealing. My friend is absolutely obsessed with those types of games and will always tell me how much of an idiot I am for not playing them and that I should really give them a shot. So, as a compromise,I bought this. \n\nDevil Daggers is a great game but also a very challenging one. The idea is simple enough. You just need to survive for as long as you can on a hellish platform as wave after wave of enemies swarms you. Sounds kind of dull now that I've written it, but it is anything but. You really need to learn to master this games mechanics if you ever want to get a time higher than 200 seconds. You need to be know the weapon better than the back of your hand (ironic seeing as the weapon IS your hand) and how to best utilize it for each enemy. Rocket jumping, shotgun blasting, short burst, bullet damage, precise aiming and strafing is necessary if you want to prevail. \n\nThe enemys are introduced slowly, but you better get used to them pretty quick, because the game is going to throw tons of them at you. Each enemy poses its own challenges, such as the flying monsters requiring you to shoot off every gem from its body before it will die, or the egg spawners who can steal your upgrade gems and turn them into more demons. The design of the demons is incredible and can make some of them really unsettling. Turning around and seeing a floating dark skull inches away from your face can be surprisingly scary when your not expecting it. Each demon has its own AI aswell, which gives them another layer of challenge and interesting design. \n\nI will also quickly note that I love the sound design on this game. Wearing headphones or having good speakers can help you hear where the enemys are going to spawn, which sounds overpowered but actually just gives you a fair chance at staying alive. It is a great feature and I am very impressed with how accurate it is. \n\nIf its not obvious, I love this game. I think it is a fantastic and well executed fast paced shooter that really rewards you for your time and effort. A must have. \n\n8/10\n\n(P.S. Even after playing this for as long as I have and loving how it handles, I'm still not interested in Doom or Quake. And weirdly, my mate, who I said loves those games at the start of this review, doesn't actually like this game very much.

Time slows down and you can hit every dagger dead center with no issues. \n\nI lightly farmed perfectly and got Level 3 midway through killing the first centipede. I started feeling cocky and then proceeded to completely screw up the 2 3-Pack spider waves. Immediately after, the 6-pack of Squid 1's spawn and I raced around the arena praying to a god I've never believed in and managed to clear the arena. \n\nAfter clearing the arena, three Squid 2's and a Squid 3 spawn and I f*cking kill everything.\n\nThe ground shakes after I killed the Squid 3, and three Gigapedes spawn, each with 50 gems, just scraping one of them would get me the Level 4 upgrade. I scraped one, got 40-something gems and \"absorbed\" the gems. Two Level-1 spiders spawn as well as a new type of spider, the dreaded... Spider 2...? Okay, yeah, Spider 2, not just a Giga-Spider. Anyways, I kill all 3 of the spiders, scrape again, get Level 4, 3 more spiders spawn, completely wipe the floor with them, and then three Squid 3's spawn. I kill those as well. After killing the Squid 3's, I spewed out at least 30 homing (f/d)aggers and ran around the arena as a handful of Squid 2's spawn. I kill all the skulls, destroy the Squid 2's, and finish off the Gigapedes.\n\nThe ground shakes violently as I see a shimmering, red, and also gargantuan figure start to materialize in front of me. And before I know it, the screen flashes red, the black abyss turns into a hellscape before my eyes and in the center of the arena, I saw what looked like the Statue of Liberty's head was chopped off, set on fire, and was given a $100 coupon for Hot Topic. I then learned that the name of this enemy is simply the [b] [i] LEVIATHAN. [/i] [/b]\n\nI ran around the arena like a headless chicken for the next minute and a half and another gigapede spawns, complete with two Spider 1's and a Giga-Spid- I mean Spider 2. I kill the spiders and then continue running around like a lost child in a Wal-mart and I hear this ear-drum shattering noise behind me. I flick my mouse around and I see a Skull 4 that was recently inside of the Leviathan, shrieking like a banshee too. Horrified, I spam the shotgun and the beast wouldn't slow down. I eventually killed it, but not long before I looked at the top of my screen, with 497 seconds, I knew for a fact that I was going to hit the 500 second mark. Time slowed down to a screeching halt as I bunny hopped away from the skulls, and I did it. I hit 500. I die and then a shiny, beautiful, red dagger flashes on my screen, spinning.\n\nI then proceeded to jump out of my chair with enough energy to send my self into the f*cking ceiling.\n\n11/10", "timestamp_created": 1501354356, "timestamp_updated": 1510254877, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33873899": {"recommendationid": "33873899", "author": {"steamid": "76561198101348264", "num_games_owned": 100, "num_reviews": 46, "playtime_forever": 3093, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510262420}, "language": "english", "review": "Devil Daggers is the closest thing I have ever seen to a perfect game. I have never played anything like it. You know, back when I used to play games for 30 - 40 hours every two weeks, it was divided between at least 3 - 5 games. In less than a single week, Devil Daggers has not only taken my playtime from the last two weeks from 4.9 hours to 20 hours+, but it has made up about half (as of writing this) of my normal two-week playtime TOTAL. As of writing this, with 16 hours logged (probably 4 of which were spent on the homescreen), my high score is 192 seconds. So what is it about this game that's so captivating? Well, I'm gonna explain it all.\n\nThe Visuals:\n\nThe low-poly 3D models mixed with an extremely low resolution and dark, gritty color palette make this game look very unique. Even when things are far away and they are being drawn using less of the massive pixels in the resolution, you can tell exactly what you're looking at.\n\nThe Game Mechanics:\n\nI have NEVER played a game with game mechanics as tight and polished as this one. Not even the overrated games of today (CS:GO, Rocket League, Overwatch, and so on) can come close to this. It's not overcrowded with different game mechanics but what they have work together in a very meaningful and seamless way. From the Rocket Jumping, Momentum, and Two-Purpose Daggers with travel time, to the spawn times of the enemies, the swarm mechanics (which I've never seen done so well before), and the shape/size of the platform. Everything. Not ONCE have I died and considered myself to have been killed by anything other than my own incompetence, and for a competitive, score based game, that is very important.\n\nThe Sound Design:\n\nYou know, as an amateur musician and aspiring audio engineer and producer, great sound design gives me a boner. I have reached the point where I've trained my ear to notice every detail of every sound, so the more you treat my ear and the better your sound works with what's being shown on screen, the more I have to rave about it. And let me just say.. This is quite possibly the single best sound design I have ever had the pleasure of experiencing in gaming. The most recent Battlefield games come close, but the sound here is so excellent that with enough practice you could probably play the game blind. Also, despite having no obligation to do so, the developer has added support for 3D binaural sound, which means when played with the right headphones, the skulls are suddenly floating right past your ear and behind your head and it feels as real as a fly buzzing around in the room near you. Every action, every enemy, and every position has a clear place in the frequency spectrum and overall soundstage of the game. Every sound adds to how satisfying the gameplay is, and you can't play the game without it. Believe me, I've tried.\n\nThe Addiction/Replayability:\n\nI genuinely fear that this game has already started to make whatever self control for gaming I thought I had vanish entirely. Every run feels completely unique, and even though I know I'm seeing the same enemies I fought last round, it still feels like an entirely new experience with new decisions to make, new problems, and new ways for me to get myself out of a pinch. Everything just feels so dynamic, and I've played games with way more content that got old way quicker (My interest is still growing and has yet to hit a plateau). This has led me to \"one more round\" myself past midnight and into the wee hours of the morning.\n\nThe Performance:\n\nI own a normal laptop. Quad-core 2.2ghz AMD A8 processor with AMD Radeon R5 Graphics and 12 GB of RAM. Not at all suitable for gaming. Well, I still get a solid 60fps early on and it still remains playable to the very last seconds of my 192 second record. If you have ANY sort of GPU, you have nothing to worry about. This is likely due to the massive pixels, low-poly models, and the fact that all that exists in the game world is a platform and hundreds of demons on it. Who knows? Maybe it's also some good old fashioned optimization.. That seems to be rare today, especially with every developer these days hopping on Unity or Unreal Engine.\n\nThe Verdict:\n\nIt's 2 am, and I'm tired. Just buy the game. It costs about as much as a fast food meal and it'll be 50 times as enjoyable for many hours longer. However, if you do buy it, prepare for a real challenge, one created simply by crafting creative enemy types to be fought with solid game mechanics instead of the generic cookie cutter fps enemies of today.", "timestamp_created": 1501309396, "timestamp_updated": 1501436169, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.550861", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33849996": {"recommendationid": "33849996", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019038274", "num_games_owned": 87, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 38, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501155662}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]CAUTION[/h1]\nIf you don't play every game on the hardest difficulty and enjoy being anihilated by extremely hard games, this is absolutely NOT FOR YOU.\n\nGreat game in terms of gameplay, graphics and style. \n\n[h1]CAPR Layout[/h1]\n\nChallenge\n\u3000Enemies which chase the player\n\u3000Enemies constantly spawn (at certain times)\n\u3000\nAppeal\n\u300090s graphics\n\u3000Arenashooter type gameplay\n\u3000Simplistic mechanics\n\u3000\nProgress\n\u3000Timer for score\n\u3000Weapon upgrades (3)\n\u3000\nReplayability\n\u3000Score can be beaten\n\u3000Score is global and compared to friends'", "timestamp_created": 1501226116, "timestamp_updated": 1501226129, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509794", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33849574": {"recommendationid": "33849574", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079179231", "num_games_owned": 122, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 3042, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512776325}, "language": "english", "review": "I am Ranked 588 and i think i have some grounds to say this is the single best game to kill time on and enjoy it.

I haven't really been that far into this. Partly because my skill set puts me at odds with these fast paced, dash and shoot, types of games. But from what I can tell. A progressive, rogue-like, arena shooter. Like a bullet hell game. But with hell spawn as bullets. Each \"level\" doesn't so much as start as it blends with the previous. With scarier looking creatures coming out of the dark dark mists of the abyss with every few kills. \n\nIt IS addicting. In the same way that Paranautical Activity was in the first weeks of owning it. Just without a random dungeon to crawl.  The demons know where you are. They are coming to you. I imagine it has something to do with the power infused blade you take at the beginning of the game.\n\nThe sounds are great. I mentioned headphones right at the beginning. Just do it! The monsters are scary. Make it loud enough that you can hear the music and then go to town. I found my self wincing and cringing in those tense moments were there were baddies on all sides. I love scary sounds. And each of these creatures has a particular creep about them to give you just the right amount of chills.\n\nFinding out just how far you can go, or what new and well crafted beasts you will come across, is allot of fun. Or maybe you fall prey to the feeling of \"I very, nearly, almost, did not die right there!!\" \n\nAnd expect to die allot. I read this in so many different games reviews. But I find it to be important that it is followed by \"so much fun\". Otherwise whats the point. It isn't frustrating. It can kill you constantly and yet have you rushing back in for more. Brilliant.\n\nAlso, leader boards. As in, the only true way to tell how far you got, is by seeing how many points you racked up. Seeing your best score right in front of you gives incentive to go for one more round. But the friends, and global leader boards, also hold some allure. For you competitive types.\n\n-TLDR-\n\nIts good.

Once you get beyond that point there will be no more content and you will be in a endless enemy pattern loop.\n\nDevil Daggers is a game for only some people... no I'm not talking about hiscorers and hardcore people. It's more restrict than that.[b]It's a game for the hardcorer's who like to crowd control swarms.[/b] The trailer is not capable of showing this well. To really know how it's the dynamic, see a elite player doing a long run. (You need anyway to get good enough at this game...)\n\nThe game has 13 enemies, but they can be boiled down to only 4 some categories: Stuff you run at max speed to escape from (skulls, spiderlings), stuff you run at full speed to kill a weak spot (spiders, spires),stuff that you find a sweat spot to hit strong (centipedes) and one that floats erratically (skull2). Almost everthing kills on contact, and that's the only action that can kill you (unless you make a dumb mistake of falling). Because of this, the tactics in the game become mostly \"run form the mob to kill the target\", that becomes repetitive really fast (and yeah... we are talking about a game of only 500 seconds... aggravate this with your replays)\n\nIn terms of mecanics, you have a lot of oldschool oddities here. Like runstraffing, rocket-jumping and bunnyhoping. but I'm not sure if all then were implemented for good here, for example: bunnyhoping seemed more a chore of remembering to press space than a thing that interferes in the tatics.\n\nDespite all that DD is really a well made game, they put a lot of effort to simulate magic carpet and quake style of sound and graphics and are really authentic. Unfortunately, they didn't have much stuff to apply it as it's only one room with only one kind of floor, adds to it the lack of music to keep the blood pumping (and to make timing more easy) and the general darkness at long range. I wish I could have a easy mode just to appreciate the artwork. It's incredible, I want a bigger game using this stuff.\n\nI'm sure that this is a good game and was built with a lot of love, but as a DooM player I discovered this is not my type of dish and because I was mislead, I give a negative.

In it's current state, I feel like $5 is a bit too much for Devil Daggers, and it feels more like an experiment than an actual game. Some improvments could be made here, such as:\n[list]\n[*][h1]More enemy variety[/h1]There should be a bit more than 13 enemies, most of which are bigger, stronger and differently colored versions of the first ones you encounter. Hell, I'd be happy if there was an entire skelton enemy added; at least it's more than a flying skull released from a tentacle monolith.\n\n[*][h1]Maps[/h1]This may be a solution to one of Olde's complaints: add a couple maps with, say, higher up platforms that can be reached via dagger jumps so they actually serve a damn purpose, or ramps with higher-up terrain. ANYTHING to add variety to the arena.\n\n*Removed because I'm a whiny little bitch. Was about Health* \n\n[*][h1]Weapon Variety[/h1]Yes. I know that it's called Devil Daggers, but at least give me some variety with the daggers other than river of daggers, wall of daggers, and aim-removing daggers. Mabye have a selection screen with three different playstyles? I don't know, but I'd like something more interesting than an overpowered verson of Quake's nailgun. \n\n*Removed this part because it would be useless. Was about a HUD*\n[/list]\nPlease consider some of the things above if you plan on improving this game.

"language": "english", "review": "This is one of the most limiting games I've ever played. Chances are you know what Devil Daggers is about. You run around a pitch black arena, you get one weapon, you die in a single hit, there are no pickups, and you fight an endless stream of enemies, which either remain stationary and fire projectiles at you or they follow a single path to you. This tries to pass itself off as a \"pure\" arena shooter, and even blatantly steals its look from Quake, but what this comes down to is endless generic shooting without any real substance. It's a crime that there's no level design as you're just on a floating platform in the middle of a black void. There's zero story or context, and while that's not necessarily a bad thing, here there isn't even a feeling of progression. This game is as purely about gameplay as you can get. This has been a universal point of praise for DD, but it's a major problem here because it doesn't feel like there's any point to it, or any fun to be had.\n\nWhen I say it's pure gameplay, I mean it. There are no environments, no areas to explore, no secrets to find, no explanations or mysteries or really anything to discover or uncover. This is Arena Shooter: The Game, but all this means is you're in a pitch black arena with endless floating bad guys to shoot. In a game like Serious Sam: TFE or TSE, there's a sense of progression, like you're actually doing something that has an effect. You explore environments with actual level design and layouts. There will be environmental hazards, hills, plateaus, items, pickups, obstacles, ramps, and otherwise things to use to help you when you get bombarded by enemies. Yes, you will fight in large \"arenas\" in Serious Sam, but you're never just in a literal circular platform floating in the middle of space.\n\nDevil Daggers feels like a mod made by someone who wanted to strip Quake of everything that made it fun just to test his skill by seeing how long he could survive against endless waves of increasingly impossible to avoid enemies and projectiles. It is clearly skill-based but the skill you develop to get better in this game won't apply to any game except this one. It relies on predictable AI and manipulating the game's point system to get into a frenzy mode. The controls are like Quake's, but should it be praised for being derivative? You really have to hate yourself to try and beat some of the records put on by people with no lives who have played this game for a thousand hours. And that's really the problem with this game. There's no reason to play except to get on the leaderboards. Even if you make first place, I fail to see what the accomplishment is there. A game with no multiplayer better have spectacular AI, since human enemies always have the potential to be smarter than AI ones; this game's AI feels like it would be beaten by the original Quake's AI. \n\nThere's no interesting art or sound design. There's no music. There's no interesting weapon design or variety. There's no information. The enemies look like they belong in a Quake mod. The only strategy is to manipulate this game's undisclosed point system to earn you certain...things (?) at certain points to progress against enemies with more health. I can appreciate the attempt to make a gameplay-focused game, but Devil Daggers makes me want to gouge my eyes out with devil daggers. You're better off watching a video of the high-score record of this game and then never looking at it again.\n\nMy biggest problem with Devil Daggers is that it was actually ranked as like number 6 in the top FPS's of all time and the best game of 2016 by Rock, Paper, Shotgun (a source that's supposed well-informed and well-versed in video games). It's just not. Even they say you can't play this game for longer than 15 minutes at a time, and there's a reason for that. This game is ugly and [b][i][u]ludicrously[/u][/i][/b] redundant. I get that stripping an entire game down to the fundamental principle of arena-shooting was the goal, but it has several arbitrary decisions and leaves me with questions that I have to seek the forums for answers to. For instance, why does your weapon fire projectiles instead of use hitscan? Why do the projectiles move so slowly? Why does it take so long to redirect your movement? How does the point system work? When do you go into berserk mode and what does it allow you to do? This game has serious problems, yet it has been hailed as one the best games of all time and consistently receives next to no criticism.\n\nDD has one trick up its sleeve: bombarding you with enemies and projectiles to avoid in a cramped space. It's literally the FPS equivalent of a SHMUP with one never-ending level that takes place in a pitch black arena (or should I include the brown floor?). Read the other reviews of this game--and keep in mind the reviewers' hours--and tell me that Devil Daggers hasn't been unfairly hailed as a godsend when there could easily be a much better \"pure\" arena shooter. This game is ugly, devoid of a good-looking style, and plays just a Flash game that your friend dares you to try out just to make you feel like a bad player. [i][u]Bizarrely, Devil Daggers has been over-refined, over-thought, and overly-stripped down to the point where there is truly no point in playing it[/u][/i]. Arbitrary gameplay decisions aside, there's just nothing interesting to look at, listen to, or play. It's a game that revolutionizes nothing, which has no end, no chance of survival, and no merit except in what it stole from a much better game.\n\nI really thought I would like this game, and I really wanted to like it, because we NEED a game like Devil Daggers. Too often new games come out that claim to have super-realistic graphics and claim to push the envelope of graphics, sound design, or realism, but have none of the brutality or skill basis that characterized FPS's in the 1990s. Those games were all about twitch reflexes, accuracy, movement, speed, control, precision, strategizing, weapon prioritization, and things like that. At its core, you can tell the developers of Devil Daggers have a kernel of understanding of what people valued in those games. And I think the people who played it believed that since this new game is a \"pure FPS,\" they thought it took the throne and became a shining example of the epitome of arena shooter gaming. Whether the developers tried to do that, I don't know, but what I do know is that it ended up taking away all that gave meaning to those games. You're in a black void with no music, hardly any sound effects, graphics blockier than the original DOOM, and enemy variety that only consists of floating skulls, monoliths, centipedes, and tentacle monsters. This POS literally won RPS's game of the year award. \n\n[i][u]Apparently all it takes to make a game of the year is to make a game whose difficulty depends on avoiding a ridiculous number of projectiles and floating enemies while you figure out how to stack kills in such a way as to get you slow-mo mode at certain times. This is so limited that it's absurd.[/u][/i]\n\nDon't get me wrong, I love gameplay-oriented games like DOOM and Quake, but Devil Daggers lacks everything that made those games fun. Even the new release of Rise of the Triad is more fun than Devil Daggers, because at least there's an environment. With Devil Daggers, there are simply no environments, no enemy weight, no gravitas, no tone, and no atmosphere.

And not be wasting time.\n\nPlayed enough. Seen enough. Should be called \"Spiders and Daggers\" because they're the enemy that varies the difficulty simply out of slight invicibility(miss target? get punished WAY HARDER with a curled up invicible spider ball you have to wait on to hit....) and can throw off kill-time(I can easily beat half the scores in the world and the game is still too hard simply bc of 1 and only 1 enemy(also, might as well start over if the spider curls up just once)). If it was just the other enemies, this game would be a big big dissapointment, anyways. Seeing how the spiders are the most unreasonably hard(for being a massive priority-they steal your upgrades) and, again, they can curl up and f*** you up so bad that the player might as well start right the f*** back over. The rest of the game looks cool. Not worth the frustration over one enemy's bad gimmic.\n\nThe leviathans would be cool to shoot at, but the spiders spawn in 3's at that point, steal your upgrades and makes Devil Daggers into Spider Daggers. If you don't have level 3 through Farming(and the game doesn't say you can farm, it requires other people's gameplays to help explain the game). I was happy up to the Farming being a necessity. Why can't I just beat a bunch of enemies and be rewarded? \n\nPros: not a hefty price, at least a few hours of fun...\nCons: the game is pacman w/gun and infinite ghosts(oh and a spider that changes things up to help things appear as a \"full game\")", "timestamp_created": 1495507551, "timestamp_updated": 1495860655, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.369128", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31909749": {"recommendationid": "31909749", "author": {"steamid": "76561198157012331", "num_games_owned": 78, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 801, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4, "last_played": 1513227352}, "language": "english", "review": "its lit", "timestamp_created": 1495497690, "timestamp_updated": 1495497690, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496689", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31907875": {"recommendationid": "31907875", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038606383", "num_games_owned": 321, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 495, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504361426}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is made of awesomeness, and misery, and demons, and death, and misery.

Eine Handlung, Charaktere oder irgendwelche Lore gibt es nicht.\n\nWir haben zwei \"Waffen\" (eigentlich Feuermodi der mit der Hand unserer Spielfigur abgefeuerten Teufelsdolche...) zur Verf\u00fcgung, einmal das gute alte (und pr\u00e4zise) Dauerfeuer und dann eine Art Streuschuss, der zwar eine gr\u00f6\u00dfe Fl\u00e4che mit Projektilen endeckt, daf\u00fcr aber langsamer schie\u00dft (weil man hier f\u00fcr jeden Schuss die linke Maustaste wieder dr\u00fccken muss).\n\nAch, und \u00fcberleben hei\u00dft hier genau eines: Nicht getroffen werden. Jup, ein Treffer und man ist tot und die Runde damit vorbei. Man stirbt \u00fcbrigens auch, wenn man aus Versehen vom Rand der Arena in den Abgrund st\u00fcrzt...\n\nZiel ist wie gesagt das m\u00f6glichst lange \u00dcberleben. Man bekommt f\u00fcr die \u00fcberlebte Zeit Punkte, so dass man dann nach der Runde in die globale Bestenliste eingetrage wird. Man hat also immer einen Anreiz, noch besser zu werden um in der Liste nach oben zu klettern. Es gibt noch einsammelbare rote Kristalle, die von manchen Gegnern bei deren Ableben fallen gelassen werden und die - bei gen\u00fcgend gesammelter Anzahl - unsere Angriffe verst\u00e4rken.\n\nEs gibt nur ein einziges Achievment, f\u00fcr das man 500 Sekunden am St\u00fcck \u00fcberleben muss. Wenn man jetzt mal bedenkt, dass sp\u00e4testens nach 1-2 Minuten (also 60-120 Sekunden) einen derart mit Gegnern zuballert, das man mit ziemlicher Sicherheit stirbt, dann d\u00fcrften wohl nur die wenigsten Spieler jemals ne Chance haben, diesen Erfolg freizuschalten.\n\nInsgesamt ist DD ein tolles Spiel, auch f\u00fcr Zwischendurch. Eben gerade weil im Normalfall die Runden doch recht kurz sind. Aber vorsicht, es macht s\u00fcchtig! \"Nur noch eine Runde\" wird man sich hier \u00f6fter denken...\n\nDer Schwierigkeitsgrad ist hoch, aber fordernd und motiviert zu immer neuen Anl\u00e4ufen. Einziger Minuspunkt ist aus meiner Sicht, dass man quasi st\u00e4ndig die ersten 60 Sekunden des Spiels wiederholt, weil die Gegner in jeder Runde genau in der gleichen Reihenfolge auftauchen (nur an leicht unterschiedlichen Stellen in der Arena). Das kann dann trotz des Suchtfaktors schon mal nerven. Hier w\u00e4re vielleicht f\u00fcr eine eventuelle Fortsetzung ein System mit Angriffswellen besser, wo man dann als Spieler selber w\u00e4hlen kann, bei welcher (bereits freigeschalteten) Welle man einsteigen m\u00f6chte.\n\nDer grafische Stil, der an Spiele aus den 90ern angelehnt ist, gef\u00e4llt mir sehr gut (was eventuell damit zu tun haben k\u00f6nnte, dass ich in besagten 90ern aufgewachsen bin... ;-) ) und wirkt insgesamt sehr zeitlos und zur H\u00f6llen-Thematik passend.\n\nDer Sound ist eher zur\u00fcckhaltend, aber immerhin kann man anhand der Ger\u00e4usche der Gegner zumindest zum Teil erkennen, wo sie sind bzw. wie nahe sie an einem dran sind.\nAch ja, ich sollte vielleicht noch erw\u00e4hnen, dass sich die meisten Gegner ein klein wenig schneller als unsere Spielfigur bewegen, weshalb weglaufen keine Dauerl\u00f6sung ist...\n\nFazit:\n\nDD ist saum\u00e4\u00dfig schwer, macht aber immer wieder Gaudi. Aber eine gewisse Frustresistenz sollte man schon mitbringen, da man selbst als ge\u00fcbter Shooterspieler hier sehr oft den L\u00f6ffel abgeben wird und den Anfang quasi in Endlosschleife wiederholt.\n\nDen Preis von 5 Euro halte ich f\u00fcr angemessen, auch wenn ich pers\u00f6nlich das Spiel in einem Sale f\u00fcr weniger (ich glaub es waren knapp 3,50) bekommen habe.\n\nWer irgendwas mit Shootern anfangen kann (und auch gut darin ist, diese zu spielen ;-) ) und ein kurzweiliges Spiel sucht, der ist hier genau richtig.", "timestamp_created": 1492000440, "timestamp_updated": 1492001899, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31095055": {"recommendationid": "31095055", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072134477", "num_games_owned": 185, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 53, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480484912}, "language": "english", "review": "one time uncle told me being married is like being chased by waves of demons that spawn in predictable patterns, but i never believed it until i played a simple game  called devils' daggers\n\n\"son being married is simple\" he told to me the night before prom,  \"you hold down left click for a continuous stream of daggers, and click right mouse button for the scatter shot\" he became stern and creased, \"son listen, when you're married it looks a lot like Quake 1\"\n\nthose words will never leave, they are seared into my bones and fused with the marrow... in a way i resent that old son of a gun, as i'm doomed to repeat his mistakes along with his successes.", "timestamp_created": 1491996099, "timestamp_updated": 1491996099, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503304", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31093006": {"recommendationid": "31093006", "author": {"steamid": "76561197975398465", "num_games_owned": 274, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 146, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511896133}, "language": "english", "review": "This game was the one that finally broke my aging Logitech G500.\n\nIt was totally worth it.", "timestamp_created": 1491985006, "timestamp_updated": 1491985006, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31081016": {"recommendationid": "31081016", "author": {"steamid": "76561198122493109", "num_games_owned": 69, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 170, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511638174}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is Amazing!

Armed with basic WASD movemen controls and your left mouse button, you're set to fail time and time again; however, failure is satisfying in Devil Daggers. You will always take something from your last run. I found myself learning audio cues, enemy placements, and optimal aiming and timing skills with each momentous death. \n\nIt's tough as nails, but it's worth every second of your time (and I mean every second, as you'll be watching your counter in the top left from the corner of your eye to \"NEW HIGHSCORE\" your friends or climb the leaderboards yourself.)

You have to be very tactical about what to kill first. You've got towers spawning in monsters to kill you and you've got monsters stealing your gems so your weapon doesn't get upgraded. I'll let you figure out the rest tho ;)\n\nPros:\n-Super cheap!\n-Hard but very rewarding once you advance.\n-Great sounds.\n-Neat looking graphics, perfect for this style.\n\nCons:\n-Won't apeal to the bigger audience since most will be bored very fast. \n-Only one gamemode.\n\nSummary:\nOver this is a super well made game with just the right things for it! I love the style and how they went about it. \nHowever, I do wish that we had more gamemodes.

And if you don\u2019t have five dollars lying around, well\u2026maybe your neighbors do. So just go to their house when they\u2019re asleep, and collect any money you see lying around.

Because if they are, then you may experience anxiety, as you hear them walking together on your lawn, or pressing your door bell. If they\u2019re snooping around, now\u2019s the time to wash and hide the blade.

How good is it? Let's find out.\n\n[h1]DEMON BLASTING FUN[/h1]\nDevil Daggers is just straight up fun. You will die in one hit. No ifs, ands or buts. The difficulty is absolutely off the scale. The game is simply nothing but endless Demon killing fun. No interuptions. You are equipped with two weapons; a rapid-fire SMG-like spell, and a super-powered shotgun-like spell. Both serve their uses to the fullest, and are very balanced in terms of enemy damage. The most common enemy you'll see are the Skulls, which are spawned from big tentacle monsters. These Skulls die in 1-3 hits, and will swarm you by the hundreds if left alive. Not killing them will result in their speed becoming faster, this makes tactical kiting a must if you want to stay alive. Some other harder and less common enemies include Spiders, Horned Skulls and Worms. All of these serve as harder enemies that will attack once you get past a certain time limit. The sound design and graphical is absolutely fantastic, and brought me back to games like DOOM. You can even watch replays to see where you went wrong, which is a cute feature. And then there's the online leaderboards, which are self-explanatory. This game's one flaw is how small it is. Even though it has alot of content, there is only one single map, and it is no bigger than 50x50 meters. This is still satisfying, but I'd like to see more maps, you know?\n\n[h1]RATING[/h1]\nDevil Daggers delivers and absolutely fantastic nostalgia trip into an unholy-blasting first person shooter, and it is one of the best small games I have ever played. Do your self a favour: spare the chocolate-bar price and pick this up, you won't regret it. It will bring you hours of frustrating and rewarding gameplay.

I'd like to think that this is because the game realises that isn't a deep, philosphical or particularly ambitious game on any account, and is rather meant to be experienced at face value: That being pure, unfiltered entertainment. I think that phrase sums up this entire game, personally; you won't be thinking about it for years to come, you likely won't discuss it for hours at a time, but you will have fun and isn't that really what matters when playing a game. I think the aesthetic simplicity of this game is one of its best aspects, as that makes it unintimidating for newcomers and easy to pick up and play casually after a long, stressful day.\n\nTechnically speaking, Devil Daggers is a joy to play. Rythm-slowing reloading is completely scrapped, a decision mirroring the design of the 2016 adaptation of DOOM, and the strafing and movement is incredibly sharp and responsive, which is necessary in a game of such difficulty.

I suppose you can say this is a bit like if Quake and Heretic were put together into a game about surviving an arena with an endless amount of enemies. This isn't an FPS where you can mindlessly run around and shoot enemies, you need to think quickly and react even quicker while you attempt to bunnyhop away from the hordes of skulls that never let up.\n\nA lot of people complain that they can't survive for long, and I know this may seem very unhelpful, but 'get gud' is literally all there is to it. When you first play, you will die over and over and over again. But over time you will learn patterns, how to prioritise your targets in any situation, and generally improve your aim.\n\nBut even then, there are many guides that will give you a lot of information on the game and its enemies, such as their health and behaviour (as well as tips for fighting them):\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=640200664\n\nThe game's soundtrack is pretty much composed of the sound effects. Everything from the general ambience to the sounds of the enemies gives the game a very uneasy feeling. The game has a (particularly frightening) menu theme, but doesn't really have any music playing during a run (probably since listening for your enemies' audio cues is so important), but I suppose you could just play Quake 1's soundtrack in the background.\n\nThe artstyle is also lovely too. Not only does it take direct inspiration from Quake 1's unique gothic looks but it pretty much nails the 'ye olde' FPS look entirely. The devs made sure the 90s look actually looks 90s without lazily making the game look like minecraft just for the sake of 'wow so retro!' \n\nThe game on the whole is bloody brilliant, and it's only 4 quid! The game might not have a large amount of content, but you'll want to keep playing due to your desire to get better and beat your times.\n\nThe only thing I hope for now from the devs is a sequel that expands the game with a single player campaign. Even if it's not a direct sequel to Devil Daggers, it would still be amazing if it still has the same kind of artstyle and gameplay with handcrafted levels. It would essentially be the Quake 1 sequel we never got (though I suppose DUSK will scratch this itch for the meantime).\n\nRecommended!", "timestamp_created": 1488839129, "timestamp_updated": 1490131918, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521542", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30361973": {"recommendationid": "30361973", "author": {"steamid": "76561198150094143", "num_games_owned": 40, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 328, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509409366}, "language": "spanish", "review": "la persona que logre llegar a 1 puta hora sin morir sera coronado rey de inglaterra\n", "timestamp_created": 1488833054, "timestamp_updated": 1488833054, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30361854": {"recommendationid": "30361854", "author": {"steamid": "76561198106383721", "num_games_owned": 145, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1899, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511209895}, "language": "french", "review": "Awesome game, addictive AF.", "timestamp_created": 1488832447, "timestamp_updated": 1488832447, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499574", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30361427": {"recommendationid": "30361427", "author": {"steamid": "76561198135362513", "num_games_owned": 145, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 336, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504477174}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is amazing, its design is masterful, you discover new mechanics on each run and get better and better each time.

Most (most) of the negative reviews are from people who played less than an hour.  One of the more common complaints is that it's too hard, and that there isn't enough content.\n\nThese people are wrong.\n\nThere is SO MUCH MORE to this game than at first glance.  The better you get at the game, the more you see of what lies beyond the first couple minutes.  Not only that, but it's surprisingly strategic.  You will eventually develop a routine for the first minute, and for the minutes after that.  The first two minutes that you struggled with so badly become child's play.\n\nAside from the gameplay, the leaderboard is one of the best features in the game.  You can watch replays from other players, and go into a top-down view to see the whole playing field.  The best players' replays are the key to getting better.  Watch them, and learn from them.\n\nHonestly I can't recommend this game enough.

The game is very pretty on the surface, but on the inside, it's really simplistic to the point it's just boring and not all that cool than it tries to be. This is so overhyped and it's really pathetic that people call this something like a \"game that is nothing like anything out there, period\". Because, let's be honest, it's a very tiny project. Is it beautiful? Yeah, yeah it is. Is it fun? Yeah, for like 5 minutes. But paying money for this and playing it like if it's a game? I don't know if i would. I'm a huge fps enthusiast. I've played millions upon billions of fps games, it's one of my top favorite genres ever. But while playing this i just kept thinking to myself: \"i'd rather play a really cool doom mod right now\". I'm shocked that this game is praised by idiot critics and even has a metascore of 83 (on par with all the good AAA games out there). So i guess, all it takes to be praised is to be all old-school-y and flashy, and to lack all the essence in terms of gameplay, while gameplay in reality is something that made all those good old-school fps games actually good, don't you think? Just adding features like \"bunnyhop\", \"rocketjump\" and etc. in an incredibly dull game is not enough to make it \"oldschool\". All that is said, it's really not the game's fault, nor the creator's. It's the same deal as with Gone Home, which wasn't a bad game on its own, untill people started raising up the bars of expectation on other people, and this game is just another victim of this hype. I guess it's an okay \"game\" to play at work from time to time, considering you have almost no time to play bigger games.

It's fast-paced survival action against skulls, skulls with horns, skulls with tentacles that spawn the skulls and skulls with horns, giant skulls with spider legs that spawn miniature skulls with spider legs, and rarely non-skull related enemies. All of which fly at you from pitch blackness, faster than you can run, and instakill you. You must survive as long as possible against Mr. Skeltals forces, armed only with Satan's Kitchen Knives.\n\nThis is one of those rare examples of a game that has managed to pack in a lot of addicting fun into a small price ($5, though it was on sale when I got it) and low hardware requirements (good for me because my computer is crap). If you're somebody who likes games that actually press you to stay on the move, keep your ears as open as your eyes, and most of all develop insane twitch aiming, this is for you. Expect to get good, very good, if you want to get far in this game. Conventional tactics typically used in easier modern survival video games will not work, enemies are too fast and varied in movement patterns to kite or camp. You will kill or be killed. If you're not the type of person who likes that, don't bother, I'm sure there's a ~$60 (plus ~$60 of \"DLC\") hand-holding \"AAA\" game out there for you. \n\nThe only downside is that the gameplay is short and only has one map(an incredibly simplistic one at that) and enemy spawn pattern(the spawn pattern is actually pretty intense). Though I guess you could consider that a good side: for $5 this game makes a very nice, short, but replayable gameplay experience. It's a very good game for attempting to rise the world leaderboards, compete with friends, or even just for trying to get a new personal best. Also personally I really like the style, visually the game does a very good job of hitting that pixelated arcade look while also being a little spooky with its abyssal horror theme. The sound is well done too, every enemy makes unique sounds, this is why using your ears in this game are so important.

This game drips with a disconcerting and dangerous atmosphere you just can't really find in giant AAA titles. Somehow they turned old school looking Quake 1 style graphics into a visual statement that's frightening and exciting to blast through.\n\nThis is not your typical first person shooter. I'm not sure if this genre has a name but the gameplay falls somewhere in line with the movies Groundhog Day or Edge of Tomorrow, only you know...in hell or something. There isn't really a level it's just a flat plain wrapped in darkness. Demonic enemies appear all around you some on a timer and some triggered by the death of other enemies (I think), and you simply try to survive as long as you can through wave after wave. This sounds simple except that I basically garuntee you the first time you play you'll die within the first 5 seconds. \n\nThen you simply respawn and try again. The enemies more or less will spawn in the same way they did before you and you use your knowledge of previous runs to help you along, but rest assured this game is painfully difficult. Success is measured in \"Seconds that you survived\" and watching better players replays (a built in feature of the game) will only make you want to try again, over and over. \n\nSeriously the amount of sweat you'll shed just to add a few seconds to your best time is a testament to how fun this game actually is. \n\nGive this deceptively complex game a try!", "timestamp_created": 1485532016, "timestamp_updated": 1485532016, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29522122": {"recommendationid": "29522122", "author": {"steamid": "76561198138206475", "num_games_owned": 463, "num_reviews": 335, "playtime_forever": 108, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485527165}, "language": "polish", "review": "\u0179le dobrany poziom trudno\u015bci.

It REALLY does have that sort of atomosphere for me. \n\nThe graphics style is a mix of Doom, Quake, an old VHS tape, and the inside of Satans brain. The art style is slightly minimalistic and the mosnter designs remind me of Shadow Of The Colossus and maybe even. . . Brutal Legend? It's so hard to even classify, the monsters definitley look absoulutely stunning either way. \n\nDevil Daggers gameplay is placed purely on skill and nothing else. There is no upgrade tree, no item shop, no story, no world building, no multiplayer. There IS however a scoreboard. For some people that is a turn off (However that 4.99 price point definitely was a turn on for me) and those people need to understand that this game is NOT for someone who loves competiveness or perhaps even someone who likes the old FPS games. Its difficulty is staggering (very reminiscent of Dark Souls, or God Hand, you must take time to hone your skills or this game will punish you brutally) and it only has one arena. Everything is smooth, quick and fluid, as is death. It will come very often so prepare yourself.\n\nAll in all, play it. It's literally 5 bucks, it's super fun, and hell, why not? 9/10 easily.

It is something you will likely understand in about 10 seconds and then it is purely down to player skill regarding if you survive. The premise is there is a \"devil dagger\" (I think?) and once you pick that up you can shoot magical bullet things from your hand. You transport into a circular arena with a deadly drop at the edges and then an eternal wave of enemies begins to pour in, from skulls, spires made of skulls, spiders made of skulls, snakes made of skulls, other types of skull related things come in, skulls, skulls, skulls! You shoot the skulls, and that is it. As a result its simplicity will no doubt be off-putting to many: it appears shallow both in its enemy variety and weaponry (magic hand, that is it) and the fact there is no easily defined plot. This simplicity is Devil Daggers strength, it does very few things, but that which it does do is VERY well done. If there is any comparison to make it would be a Serious Sam arena stripped of all the level design fluff leaving only the bare combat, making you scoot about prioritising enemies and considering when to fire and when to not fire, when to use the basic magic machine gun attack or hold off for a second for a single magic shotgun burst, or when to stop firing altogether to make the power-ups  fly to you. Everything is fast, instinctual and reactionary and for that it is possibly one of the most bullshit free FPS games I think I've played in many, many years.\n\nThe simplicity of Devil Daggers makes me hold back from saying I advise it. I conditionally advise it. It is so basic that you will either love it or hate it.\nDo you like FPS? If the answer is no, stop.\nDo you like realism? If the answer is yes, stop.\nDo you need deep narrative? If the answer is yes, stop.\nDo you like twitchy, fast paced games? If the answer is no, stop.\nDo you like score attack games with no real greater purpose than just fulfilling your need to have an endorphin rush, something to sink time into now and then rather than a long and meaningful experience that the games industry seems to keep pushing? If the answer is yes, maybe this is the game for you.\n\nJust remember, if you stop moving, you die.", "timestamp_created": 1485120358, "timestamp_updated": 1485120358, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.539924", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29426115": {"recommendationid": "29426115", "author": {"steamid": "76561198139007144", "num_games_owned": 160, "num_reviews": 120, "playtime_forever": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485103767}, "language": "german", "review": "Dieses Spiel kann ich jedem empfehlen, der seinen Skill-Level unter Beweis stellen m\u00f6chte.", "timestamp_created": 1485103855, "timestamp_updated": 1485103855, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476882", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29422958": {"recommendationid": "29422958", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967750722", "num_games_owned": 173, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 300, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485094405}, "language": "english", "review": "Cool game killed by poor design.

There are very few of the tropes that most FPS games carry as baggage. In Devil Daggers...there's no map, no health kits, no lives, no continues, no save points, no plot... and no escape.\n\nYou have death constantly rain down on you and swirl around you. You fire back with daggers to hold them off.... and that's IT. \n\nYou will be lucky to last a minute before death finds you and ends your game.\n\n...and you will play it again and again and again. Much like the arcade games of old, it's easy to play - and near impossible to master. The difficulty is brutal and unforgiving... which makes it great for a high-score challenge, and great as a casual game that you don't want to invest much time into (not that it will let you anyway!)\n\nAfter suffering death and reincarnation over and over again.... you will have a religious experience. Your mind will become Zen. You will FEEL where those skulls are behind your back without even seeing them. You will be at one with the force, and then... only then.... you might last an entire **three minutes** before dying!\n\nDevil Daggers has the best impression of hell that I've seen in a video game. Visually, sonically, and stylistically, it is downright evil... and to top it off the gamplay is addictive while being utterly merciless.

The spider is a very unique enemy in how it negatively affects your game, but the game actually gives you a mini tutorial for the unique demon while there are few enemies around in the early game to distract you.\n    Trust me, get this game, it is worth more than the $5 they charge and I have over 35 hours logged.", "timestamp_created": 1484103464, "timestamp_updated": 1484103464, "voted_up":

Usually i don't care about highscores in games, but this game got it right.\nThe game will put your skills to a hard, hard test while it gives you a movement-system, which is very fluid and precise.\nI love this movement-sytem to death, i could bunnyhop, strafe-  and rocketjump all day and night in this game.\n\nThe game is very predictable, meaning that every enemy appears to a specific time, but everything happens so fast, when you do something slightly different, faster, slower or in different order, you will have an different outcome you'll have to deal with. To me this game always manages to challange me and i always want to optimize a little more so i can squeeze out a few seconds more.\n\nThe game can also be very frustrating and sometimes you get a feeling like, \"omg, this is to much!!!!\" But it pisses you off in a way, you wan't to continue, well at least it worked for me, the last session i had, i found myself playing this game for about 4 hours, never felt bored for 1 minute. Mostly because of that fluid movement-system and because it feels so good to wreck these fools. After all, it is a very rewarding yet simple game, with hidden complexity underneath it.\n\nThe graphics, they are done pretty good i think. It's an very cohesive artstyle. I especially love how the animations/pixels melt into each other, if that makes sense... very fluid again. The colors are picked well, giving it a dark but also colorfull feel.\nSometimes i have a hard time to maintain my overview, when a lot is going on, because of the pixely graphics itself, but it ain't all that bad. After all in my opinion they got a very good art direction, which helps the overall feel of the game.\n\nThe sounddesign is also something with thought behind it. It can be very minmalistic, but you wan't to have it that way, so you can hear where the enemies are and what they are doing at any given time. It has this sick and transdimensional vibe to it. The first weapon sounds weak to me but the the other ones, oh my god, they sound like a device invented in collaboration by satan and cthulhu. Very punchy and weird in a cool way.\n\t\nSo if you like your challange and a game which can be played in short burst or if you are an addict like me for hours upon hours, for 5 Dollar you can't go wrong!", "timestamp_created": 1483696860, "timestamp_updated": 1491946196, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29050699": {"recommendationid": "29050699", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043163280", "num_games_owned": 385, "num_reviews": 46, "playtime_forever": 33, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483673672}, "language": "english", "review": "[i] First 1990s software-style rendering that runs smooth  [/i]", "timestamp_created": 1483672456, "timestamp_updated": 1483672456, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29031826": {"recommendationid": "29031826", "author": {"steamid": "76561198213141983", "num_games_owned": 248, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 63, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503510404}, "language": "french", "review": "dur difficile quasi impossible du defi pur voila ce que vous aurez en y jouant ce jeu est une torture fermez la porte eteignez votre telephone prevenez vos parents ou votre petite amie vous allez devenir accro et vous allez mourir une centaine de fois red bull a la main et souris dans l'autre vous allez criez de rage devant ces demons qui ne vous laisseront respirez que lorsque vous mourrez plus vous allez avancez plus vos mouvements peuvent vous tuez chaque pas est une epreuve preparez a douillez mentalement vous ne mourrez que 59 fois par minute est ce que vous etes forts et est ce que vous allez affrontez les demons ou est ce que vous allez vous defilez ?", "timestamp_created": 1483616237, "timestamp_updated": 1483616237, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499574", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29027615": {"recommendationid": "29027615", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017795927", "num_games_owned": 174, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 269, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489131844}, "language": "english", "review": "As close to perfection as any human endeavour has come.

I understand that's on purpose and adds to the challenge but to me it just adds frustration. There's no hp or lives so one single hit from any enemy will have you instantly killed and you have to start over again with the same set enemy patterns which only change in initial spawn position, and after an hour I find this gets really repetitive.

As time goes on, more demons will begin to spawn around you. That's it. This sounds monotonous but the sheer difficulty and unforgiving nature of this game means that you die over and over and over again but you don't get frustrated and you don't get bored. I say unforgiving, the arena is relatively small and there are often more than fifty of these demons to contend with. Take into account the fact that one touch from any enemy will end your run, and it is clear to see how this game would be a tough one.\n\nRegardless, it's dirt cheap, the controls are as simple as they come, (requiring the use of just WASD, Space, and the mouse) and the atmosphere the game creates, especially when played in the dark with headphones on, is incredible- one of the best I've ever experienced in any video game. Each demon has its own individual 'cry,' meaning the player knows, if they listen carefully, which demons are in the arena at the given time, and more importantly, where they are.\n\nThis is without doubt my single favourite release of 2016, definitely my vote for game of the year.

That said, it's also one of the best games I've ever played. I would describe it as a hardcore arcade game for people who enjoy first-person shooters. Because that's essentially what this game is- an arcade game- since the only object of the game is to beat your previous highscore. Theres no levels, you're always on the same huge platform floating in the middle of a black void. There's also nothing in the way of a storyline, but I think that was intentional, to emphasize how gameplay-driven this game really is. You can tell that a lot of effort was put into perfecting the physics- running, strafing, jumping, and rocket jumping feel seamless. The game makes you feel like a worthless weakling every time an enemy kills you in one hit, yet God-like when you've upgraded your weapon a bit, and you rocket jump around the map like a gleeful idiot, just absolutely shredding through enemies. The level of difficulty in this game is relentless, and if you're up for a challenge (which you should be) it'll drive you to get better. And once you're good at this game, you enjoy it all the more.

Eventualmente, la cacer\u00eda concluye con uno siendo finalmente acorralado y se establece un contacto f\u00edsico que desencadena en la muerte del mismo. [i]Devil Daggers[/i] se luce como un interminable ensayo, de una partida que jam\u00e1s se va a completar.\n\n[h1]Ecos del pasado[/h1]\nGr\u00e1ficamente evocando al [i]Quake[/i] original del \u201896, el juego luce un apartado gr\u00e1fico que le hace distinci\u00f3n, y como t\u00edtulo que se respeta a s\u00ed mismo, sobre \u00e9l flamea la bandera del dise\u00f1o por sustracci\u00f3n, haciendo gala en el escenario vac\u00edo \u2015no interactivo\u2015 que solo sirve para circular en evasiva, enemigos que solo siguen un patr\u00f3n simple, y una interfaz inexistente, todo en pos de la inmersi\u00f3n del jugador, evitando todo aquellos que interfiera con la fluidez y sumersi\u00f3n atmosf\u00e9rica.\n\nCompletamente carente de argumento o contexto sobre la mesa, [i]Devil Daggers[/i] hace reminiscencia al g\u00e9nero retro en el cual se inspira, volviendo a las ra\u00edces, a la infancia de la industria como medio l\u00fadico para la diversi\u00f3n y entretenimiento del consumidor, sin necesidad de una justificaci\u00f3n narrativa. [i]Devil Daggers[/i] es, en esencia, un t\u00edtulo destinado a los amantes del g\u00e9nero first-person shooter en su \u00e9poca dorada.\n\nCarente de m\u00fasica o banda sonora, lo \u00fanico a o\u00edr ser\u00e1 el interminable eco producido por los r\u00e1pidos cazadores mientras se acercan y alejan del jugador, todo esto acompa\u00f1ado del impacto de las dagas que de pocas pausas constar\u00e1. No solo eso, sino que el t\u00edtulo hace gala de un sonido envolvente dise\u00f1ado exclusivamente para cascos, con los cuales uno podr\u00e1 conocer la posici\u00f3n de los enemigos al o\u00edr de donde vienen. Dicho eco perpetuo se ir\u00e1 acentuando conforme a m\u00e1s enemigos aparezcan en pantalla, plasmando una melod\u00eda demencial en la mente del jugador.\n\n[h1]Las matices del desaf\u00edo[/h1]\nDe jugabilidad simple y r\u00e1pida, tan intuitiva como le sea posible, con la posibilidad de ajustar el FOV para complementarla a elecci\u00f3n, esta fue concebida para sentirse como aquella maniobrabilidad de los a\u00f1os \u201990; en [i]Devil Daggers[/i] la \u00fanica diferencia resta sobre la falta de armamento o equipo disperso por el escenario, pues nada de aquello se encontrar\u00e1 aqu\u00ed. El protagonista dispone \u00fanicamente de sus dagas m\u00e1gicas y su \u00fanica manera de mejorarlas es la absorci\u00f3n de cristales que est\u00e1n incrustados a enormes enemigos y act\u00faan de puntos d\u00e9biles, por lo que uno debe abrir fuego sin perder punter\u00eda a la vez que esquiva a incontables hordas de entidades menores.\n\nLos cristales ir\u00e1n mejorando el desarrollo de la partida a nuestro favor, siendo el \u00fanico requisito para atraerlos tal cual im\u00e1n el dejar de disparar, a medida que se obtengan el protagonista ir\u00e1 haciendo gala de habilidades especiales con las cu\u00e1les la dificultad en el aspecto de manejo se ver\u00e1 reducida, mas no la dificultad del escenario, pues este ir\u00e1 elevando su dificultad progresivamente, a\u00f1adiendo m\u00e1s enemigos y nuevas entidades de mayor complejidad a un ritmo sin pausas; sin contar con el hecho de que ciertas entidades se har\u00e1n con dichos cristales si no se eliminan a tiempo y con las hordas menores siendo una constante. \nEs aqu\u00ed cuando entra en juego la capacidad del jugador de manipular la dificultad mediante la priorizaci\u00f3n, puesto que cada enemigo requiere una aproximaci\u00f3n diferente a un ritmo distinto, y al haber varios tipos de ellos en pantalla, el orden de acciones lo cambia todo.\n\nPero la adici\u00f3n de estos elementos no es proceduralmente. El juego posee cierto esquema de puzle. Puesto que las partidas est\u00e1n orquestadas desde el vamos, la posici\u00f3n de los enemigos principales y su aparici\u00f3n es algo que no cambiar\u00e1, por lo que cada partida se sentir\u00e1 como un acertijo, una combinaci\u00f3n de movimientos y acciones a realizar en un momento dado a medida que los segundos pasen, gatillando la entrada en escena de cada entidad horrida. El t\u00edtulo requiere tanto reflejos, como memoria y rapidez mental.\n\n[h1]Dise\u00f1o[/h1]\nUna de las cosas m\u00e1s importantes que [i]Doom[/i], entre otros, dejaron a la industria fue un esquema de dise\u00f1o al cual el dise\u00f1ador Harvey Smith denomin\u00f3 como [i]Diferenciaci\u00f3n Ortogonal de Unidades[/i] que, expresado de una manera sencilla, significa que los enemigos son propietarios de particularidades \u00fanicas, siendo el dise\u00f1o y programaci\u00f3n de cada uno independiente del otro. Por lo que Smith concluye que gracias a esto, el jugador, comienza a actuar intencionalmente, realizando decisiones significativas y estrat\u00e9gicas en lugar de solo reaccionar al azar a lo que aparece en pantalla. \n\nYa no se trata de esquivar y disparar; uno es forzado a deliberar cada movimiento de manera estrat\u00e9gica o de lo contrario no resistir\u00e1. Los enemigos gozan de un ampliamente variado dise\u00f1o y esquema de patrones a analizar; atributos \u00fanicos que al ser memorizadas le otorgan el control de la situaci\u00f3n al jugador. Todo lo anteriormente dicho se aleja de los t\u00edtulos de hoy en d\u00eda, cuya escala de enemigos es b\u00e1sicamente, la adici\u00f3n de mayor resistencia, acompa\u00f1ada de mayor da\u00f1o, o simplemente, mayor n\u00famero.\n\n[i]Devil Daggers[/i] realiza un correcto uso de este dise\u00f1o, pues para acabar con ciertos enemigos se deben atacar los cristales que tienen incrustados, y el n\u00famero de estos var\u00eda seg\u00fan el objetivo, lo que desencadena en decisiones de priorizaci\u00f3n. Esto le da a nuestros compa\u00f1eros de baile un sello distintivo que hace de la danza mortal algo m\u00e1s que solo ponerse a esquivar, y es, ponerse a pensar.\n\n[h1]Bailando al comp\u00e1s de los n\u00fameros[/h1]\nB\u00e1sico, amigable y de f\u00e1cil manejo, su esquema de controles puede ajustarse para complacer al jugador. Aunque carente de interfaz, esta puede activarse con una tecla; dicha interfaz opcional no es m\u00e1s que un cron\u00f3metro que marcar\u00e1 nuestro tiempo de supervivencia en el escenario.\n\nEste cron\u00f3metro, aunque no lo parezca, es extremadamente \u00fatil, puesto que al estar todo orquestado, \u2015como si de un puzle se tratase\u2015 el tener un ojo sobre el lapso transcurrido desde el inicio le permite al jugador predecir el siguiente acto de la obra macabra del juego en pos de adecuar su estrategia tanto a la posici\u00f3n de los actuales objetivos, como el de los que est\u00e1n por hacer presencia.\n\n[h1]\u00bfLo hizo bien?[/h1]\n[i]Devil Daggers[/i] tom\u00f3 las referencias correctas y las puso en pr\u00e1ctica de manera impecable, dando as\u00ed, su mejor versi\u00f3n posible en base a su contenido, posiblemente la falta de este le condene a largo plazo, pero su carisma actual es suficiente para hacerle a uno volver al desaf\u00edo a pesar del paso del tiempo. Lo m\u00e1s llamativo resulta ser el hecho de que haya tomado prestado mucho de antiguas obras de culto y les haya sabido quitar todo aquello que esta obra no necesitaba, garantizando adem\u00e1s la dosis correcta de todo lo ya implementado.\n\n[table][tr][td][url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/9059978]Seguir a Mentor P\u00edxel para m\u00e1s an\u00e1lisis y rese\u00f1as[/url][/td][/tr][/table]", "timestamp_created": 1482006179, "timestamp_updated": 1507032783, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 42, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.754060", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28431611": {"recommendationid": "28431611", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011726945", "num_games_owned": 147, "num_reviews": 93, "playtime_forever": 72, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482239330}, "language": "english", "review": "I don't think that I was EVER this proud of myself for staying alive in a game for 88 seconds straight!\nLoving every second of it!", "timestamp_created": 1482001867, "timestamp_updated": 1482001867, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490196", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28421301": {"recommendationid": "28421301", "author": {"steamid": "76561198302518562", "num_games_owned": 80, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 35, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500812150}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u975e\u5e38\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u602a\u7269\u8981\u901f\u5ea6\u6740\u73a9", "timestamp_created": 1481966781, "timestamp_updated": 1481966781, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28402192": {"recommendationid": "28402192", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013547298", "num_games_owned": 418, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 5839, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512438476}, "language": "english", "review": "Unless you know this is a game for you, I suggest you shy away from jumping for your wallet.

It blends such old, simple, and new ideas in such a way that I could almost call it perfect. However, I cannot recommend it to the average consumer who is actually looking to beat this game.\n\n[h1]Gameplay:[/h1]\n\nAs you can tell, the game is a survival/bullet-hell first person shooter. The goal is as simple as it can be, to survive. The player must fight hordes and hordes of demonic skulls and other monsters to survive, and anything touched is an instant game over. The player can also fall off of the stage if they aren\u2019t careful.\n\nThe controls are as expected, WASD keys to move, Space to jump, hold-click to fire a stream of daggers, and single-click to fire a shotgun like blast. You can also use techniques such as bunny hopping and dagger jumping (like rocket jumping) to improve your survivability. The controls are smooth for the most part, except for when in the air, mid-flight controls and momentum always feel a little off and can be hard to control. This is really the only fault of the gameplay.\n\nThe only way to improve your power is by collecting red gems, given by killing enemies. They naturally float towards you when you are not shooting. If you are using continuous fire, they will maintain their trajectory and potentially fly off the stage. If you use a shotgun blast, they will forcefully move away from you, so there a nice risk vs. reward system that adds a bit more depth to the game.\n\nThe main goal is to survive at least 500 seconds, which sounds so simple, yet is incredibly devious.\n\nAs the waves of enemies start coming and new baddies start to show up, it becomes quite clear that it is not an easy task. Each game only lasts so many minutes, and the process of repetitive deaths and refining one\u2019s skills is how players must get better.\n\nLuckily, with the leaderboards, if the eye symbol is clicked next to a player entry, the game will render their best run in real-time, so you can observe more experienced players as to how they progressed in-game.\n\nThere are certain points in the game where the player is thrown either something new or challenging that they can become walls. Learning to break down these walls can take much practice or even a change in strategy to overcome. Breaking them down to the point where you can breeze through that section of a run is a very satisfying feeling. This process sounds so simple and easy to maneuver, but keep in mind that it took me over 100 hours across four months to beat the game.\n\nThe game\u2019s mechanics are rock solid, and achieve nearly everything they set out to do, specifically to provide a genuine challenge to the player. It\u2019s to no surprise that the lead developer of the game was also behind [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/65300/]Dustforce[/url].\n\n[h1]Graphics:[/h1]\n\nThe game clearly has a late-90\u2019s, early 3D era level of aesthetics, and I feel that the art design is fantastic. The developer used multiple approaches such as simple models, crude draw distance, and unfiltered textures to achieve the level of authenticity they reached. It\u2019s clear that the artist became familiar with the limitations of early-3D games and worked within those limitations to deliver something great.\n\nThe designs of the enemies are rather interesting, and as someone who has spent so much time with the game, they have a great amount of detail to them despite them being such low-poly models. The main boss especially looks excellent, as it has such an alien, chthonic design that it really amplifies the game\u2019s intensity when you finally reach it. Even the player hand design is interesting, as how the game begins with only two fingers raised, and as you collect gems, each level up gives another finger until all five are raised. It was a great way to convey how powerful the player is without having to resort to a standard UI.\n\nAlso there isn\u2019t even a model of the player character\u2019s body, it is literally just a hand. Why? Because it\u2019s not needed.\n\nOther details I\u2019ve noticed were how the squid spawners even have little nods to the design of the skull they spawn, and how the boss is basically a sick amalgamation of spiders, skulls, and squids. In addition, the Space Odyssey-like event that happens when you walk under the boss is amazing.\n\nThe whole game has a mysterious, Cthulhu-like vibe, somewhat similar to the first Quake, but also has its own feel and sense of doom and desolation. It seems that this self-imposed limitation of graphical fidelity worked out for the game rather well. This prowess over graphical limitations is why I feel some early 3D games such as Spyro The Dragon still hold up remarkably well.\n\n[h1]Sound:[/h1]\n\nThe sound design is also no slouch whatsoever. There is no traditional soundtrack, in the sense that there are four pieces of music that play at various points outside the core game. Each track has its own purpose and each belong to different genres of music, yet they still all cater to the eeriness and creepiness that the aesthetics are going for.\n\nThe main audio that players will be hearing is the in-game sound effects/ambience, and might I say that the entire soundscape is incredible. Each entity in the game carries its own continuous sound, so that it becomes easy to sense how far/close it is in regards to your position. Please use headphones when playing this game, it makes the game much easier to play and progress through. For example, the muffled laughter of the charging skulls is very easy to pick out from the background, which is great design since the charging skulls are one of the few enemies that can outrun you and must be dealt with immediately.\n\nOther sound effects are used to add a real kick to the gameplay, such as the screech that is heard when you shoot daggers with the second or third upgrade, which really makes you feel like you have the powers of a god and that using them even causes yourself to be pained.\n\nAll aspects of the audio design are fantastic, are used in a very practical way, and deliver an edge to the game over other games of its type.\n\n[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]\n\nThis game is the embodiment of the phrase, \u201csimple to play, difficult to master\u201d. The game in itself is rather simple, yet every aspect of it is expertly polished. It shows true mastery in each of the developers\u2019 craft. It\u2019s clear that a three person team: a programmer, artist, and sound designer alone are enough to provide an engrossing experience.\n\nBut why have I listed the game as \u201cNot Recommended\u201d? It\u2019s simply because I don\u2019t recommend this game to the average person who will be reading this review. The game itself is of pure quality and its execution is remarkable, but in order to even see the majority of this game\u2019s content, you need to fall under the less than 1% of players who are willing to spend dozens of hours on a five dollar game that is just survival with no plot.\n\nIf you are fine paying a few dollars to see some of the art assets and ambiance of the first few waves of the game, knowing that you will only go that far, go right ahead and purchase it. If you are willing to spend close to 100 hours trying to master the game and become one of the few dozen to beat it, go right ahead and purchase it. To literally anyone else, which I feel is the majority of my readers, I cannot recommend this game.\n\nIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want Sorath to be financially successful; it\u2019s just that when they decided to develop such a game like Devil Daggers, they definitely would have expected much more of a niche audience. I wish the best for them regardless.\n\nThank you.", "timestamp_created": 1481445491, "timestamp_updated": 1481445526, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 82, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.575783", "comment_count": "24", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28302477": {"recommendationid": "28302477", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067601036", "num_games_owned": 80, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 638, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511169524}, "language": "english", "review": "pretty self-explanatory game. really i'm only writing this review just cause i like the game. watch the video and you've already seen a lot.\n\neasy to play, really hard to master. forces you to be aware of your surroundings, so you need to use your ears and keep track of multiple incoming enemies while prioritising which enemy to take down.\n\ngood simple fun reminiscent of the late 90s/early 00s style FPS. there's only one weapon with two firing modes (continuous blast of projectiles or a spread of projectiles) but the fact that the game doesn't have crosshairs or isn't a hitscan really helps you to improve at aiming in general.\n\nno multiplayer, but you're able to keep track of your friends' (and every other person in the world) record highs and even watch their best replays at the click of a button. now how cool is that? i wish more games would have this feature.", "timestamp_created": 1481431423, "timestamp_updated": 1485260180, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28295662": {"recommendationid": "28295662", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035691225", "num_games_owned": 18, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 14218, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511470410}, "language": "english", "review": "Probably the best $5 I've ever spent in my life and a cure to my obsessive self-improvement behavior in crappy mobile games like Don't Touch The Spikes and Flappy Bird.

The title screen is nothing more than Play, Leaderboards, and Options. When you play, there's only one thing in your vision. A glowing dagger. You pick it up and find that you can shoot the titular Devil Daggers from your fingers in an effort to survive in Hell for as long as possible.\n\nThis game has one achievement, and that's to survive for 500 seconds. Sounds simple enough, right? And really,the simplicity of everything is what makes this game work. You can move, jump, and shoot with either a constant stream of daggers or a shotgun like blast, good for close encounters. The spot on controls and simple but deep mechanics make this game the very definition of pick up and play. So what's the problem?\n\nThe problem is that Hell lives up to its name in this game. Starting with a wave of flying skull spawning demon pillar things, the game throws wave after wave of enemy hoards at you. You need to constantly be aware of your surroundings, as one hit from anything- ANYTHING AT ALL- and you're sent back to the beginning. And believe me when I say that surviving for even thirty seconds will test the skill of most players.\n\nMuch like the aforementioned Hotline Miami, though, the simplicity of the mechanics means that restarting after you die quickly becomes a \"just one more try\" play session and before you know it an hour has gone by. It's a difficult game to put down, that's for sure.\n\nSpecial mention should be given to the aesthetics and sound. Monsters make horrifying noises that also let you know when they're near. Their deisgns are otherworldly and disturbing. Honestly, this is a more effective horror game than most others on the market.\n\nAnd that's about it when it comes to this game. I've made it 88 or 89 seconds so far, and according to the leaderboards, that places me at about the 23000th best player in the world, ahead of almost 50000 others. That should tell you something about how tough this game is.

The core game design is fairly similar to a classic arcade game - there is no way to progress except by learning the patterns and getting better at dealing with them. When you die, you start over. There's no \"level 2\" to reach, no checkpoints, no continues. Play until you lose, then try again from the beginning.\n\nThe game itself has the appearance of a mid-90s FPS, and all of the mechanics are implemented exceptionally well. Movement and shooting feels great, enemies have interesting swarming behavior, and the sound design is incredible. Each enemy type makes a unique sound, and with the positional audio you can often know exactly what enemies are present and where they are without even needing to see them.\n\nHighly recommended for anyone that enjoys fast-paced FPSes and playing a game solely for the sake of improving at it. And if you can get some friends to play, competing with them on the leaderboards can be a lot of fun (especially since you can watch each other's replays).", "timestamp_created": 1480364490, "timestamp_updated": 1480364490, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501365", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27988132": {"recommendationid": "27988132", "author": {"steamid": "76561198261368729", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1941, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490752408}, "language": "english", "review": "Great little time killer that is creepy and somewhat addicting. \n\nDon't play it in the dark", "timestamp_created": 1480363618, "timestamp_updated": 1480363618, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509209", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27987373": {"recommendationid": "27987373", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999188358", "num_games_owned": 273, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 471, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487453991}, "language": "english", "review": "Simple and addictive.\n\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1480363145, "timestamp_updated": 1480363145, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27984730": {"recommendationid": "27984730", "author": {"steamid": "76561198094226085", "num_games_owned": 182, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 213, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496244936}, "language": "english", "review": "2Spooky4me ;-; FeelsBadMan", "timestamp_created": 1480361544, "timestamp_updated": 1511425822, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501348", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27968190": {"recommendationid": "27968190", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009094843", "num_games_owned": 340, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 542, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497129723}, "language": "english", "review": "It's fun, simple, and challenging.

The more gems you get, the more daggers you can throw. \n\nThis game is super hard, but while frustrating, a lot of fun if you're into the old school Quake-style shooter.\nIt's also extremely satisfying when you [i] finally [/i] beat your (or some of your friends' for that matter) highscore.", "timestamp_created": 1480241505, "timestamp_updated": 1480241505, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27794062": {"recommendationid": "27794062", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997823372", "num_games_owned": 153, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 253, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494219888}, "language": "english", "review": "So good.

No estoy desetimando a sus apartados gr\u00e1fico ni sonoro. Ambos son impresionantes. Pero la verdadera raz\u00f3n por la que merece la pena jugar este juego son sus mec\u00e1nicas. \n   [i]Devil Daggers[/i] es un [i]shooter[/i] en primera persona.

S\u00ed, la c\u00e1mara presenta la acci\u00f3n en primera persona dejando ver lo que se encuentre frente a ti, incluida tu arma, en este caso tu brazo. Disparas con un bot\u00f3n, saltas con otro. Pero si se usan ambos juntos, apuntando hacia el suelo, se realiza un [i]rocket jump[/i], una mec\u00e1nica propia no s\u00f3lo de los [i]First Person Shooters[/i], sino tambi\u00e9n de los [i]TPS[/i], como [i]Team Fortress 2[/i]. Ahora, una de las mec\u00e1nicas que cuenta de otros juegos del g\u00e9nero es la mejora del arma principal con la obtenci\u00f3n de objetos obtenidos por la eliminaci\u00f3n de enemigos. O, el tipo de disparo: si se presiona una sola vez el bot\u00f3n de disparo saldr\u00e1 un tiro de escopeta del arma, pero si se mantiene presionado ser\u00e1 una r\u00e1faga parecida a una metralleta, por lo que depender\u00e1 del jugador determinar qu\u00e9 tiro es conveniente en cada circunstancia. \n    Parecen pocos comandos, pero han sido implementados de una manera sabia. El salto tambi\u00e9n permite desplazarse con mayor velocidad si se realiza varias veces hacia una direcci\u00f3n. Y el \u00fanico comando del que no he hablado es el realizado con la tecla \"R\". Presion\u00e1ndola se vuelve a empezar una partida y, cr\u00e9eme, esa tecla la usar\u00e1s much\u00edsimo. \n    Se trata de un juego muy adictivo no s\u00f3lo a sus mec\u00e1nicas sino tambi\u00e9n al dise\u00f1o de enemigos y la disposici\u00f3n de los mismos que son testimonio de un maravilloso dise\u00f1o. Es un juego fren\u00e9tico que te invita a perfeccionarlo para durar unos cuantos segundos m\u00e1s en la pr\u00f3xima partida.

Quando s\u00e3o mortos, alguns dem\u00f4nios liberam gemas vermelhas que podem ser coletadas pelo jogador e assim ele consegue upgrades autom\u00e1ticos nas suas magias.

Pulling off perfect bunnyhops will increase your speed, timing shotgun blasts with your jumps to launch yourself over enemies, after a while everything works together perfectly until you're gliding around the arena and through the smallest gaps between demons.\n\nAll in all Devil Daggers is one of those games that you can very easily get addicted to, staying up countless hours just to beat your score by at least a second or two.

At its best this game is frustrating, terrifying, and is incredibly addictive in spades, and will leave you with an adrenaline rush and the need to fight for those extra few seconds for that high score.\nThe game runs exceptionally well, mostly due to its rendering style. The low-poly and low-resolution style is mesmerizing as legions upon legions of skulls dance across the screen, giving it a style not often seen nowadays. Another wonderful draw is the brilliant sound design, which is emphasized by the use of positional audio. There is little like knowing exactly what and where the enemy is merely by the use of sound.\n\nAll in all, I would highly recommend this game to anybody who enjoys FPS in its most distilled form, and can happily throw themselves at the game again when they fail against adversary, as death in Devil Daggers is not a question of [i]if[/i], but rather [i]when[/i].", "timestamp_created": 1479941312, "timestamp_updated": 1479941312, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26928581": {"recommendationid": "26928581", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993546390", "num_games_owned": 447, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 393, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487172749}, "language": "english", "review": "Distilled FPS greatness.", "timestamp_created": 1479941106, "timestamp_updated": 1479941106, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26923420": {"recommendationid": "26923420", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023968847", "num_games_owned": 435, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1542, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481796231}, "language": "english", "review": "Jogo perfeito para quem gosta de desafiar suas abilidaes ou de jogos dificeis.", "timestamp_created": 1479940305, "timestamp_updated": 1479940305, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501282", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26922831": {"recommendationid": "26922831", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041060080", "num_games_owned": 387, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 175, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479940199}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is dope", "timestamp_created": 1479940218, "timestamp_updated": 1479940218, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26919375": {"recommendationid": "26919375", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967597434", "num_games_owned": 471, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 195, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479939793}, "language": "english", "review": "hail satan\n\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1479939705, "timestamp_updated": 1479939705, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26917124": {"recommendationid": "26917124", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972486190", "num_games_owned": 633, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 98, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496836604}, "language": "english", "review": "fast paced and fun", "timestamp_created": 1479939384, "timestamp_updated": 1479939384, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501247", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26914036": {"recommendationid": "26914036", "author": {"steamid": "76561198092593279", "num_games_owned": 658, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 10, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479938918}, "language": "english", "review": "Real brutal challenge.

I might have lasted 30 seconds at first by running away from things (includes first 13 seconds of relative calm), but kept at it and eventually lasted a whole minute. \n\nIt was around then that I saw a top leaderboard replay (click the eye) and found out how to play properly. The leaderboard-with-replays-available aspect makes it a competitive game, and sometimes I'll just click on a lower ranked random player to see if I can steal any tricks.\n\nSome thought has gone into the graphics and sound design. Aesthetically it looks Quake-ish, and not surprisingly one can do rocket jumps and bunny hop to get around. The graphics really drive home the whole \"you're in hell, death is imminent\" theme nicely. On my 5.1 surround I can hear spawners (???) appearing behind me, and those horned skulls charging from my blind spot....getting ever closer. Surround-sound rigs will get a better experience, for sure.\n\nIn a nutshell: Devil Daggers is a purist FPS experience with a focus on arena survival. By itself it would be a good game, but having leaderboards with replays makes it competitive and fun. Lasting longer than ever before is genuinely rewarding, because it's hard to do until you note certain patterns with experience (lots of dying).\n\n[b]Absolutely worth 5 dollars.[/b] Fun to pick up and play a few rounds inside ten minutes and get your fix. Just buy it if you're anywhere near the fence. \n\n**Also, that reviewer who said that \"being in the zone creates a state of mind not unlike meditation\" (roughly paraphrased) was spot on.

You must kill everything the second it appears on your screen or die just moments later, the momentum of your \"lack of aim\" will screw you over later on. I call it \"lack of aim\" because the hitboxes of the enemies feels off and your bullets feel sluggish. Many times I have actually watched my bullets go through the target I'm trying to kill and I guess it just didn't register, pretty big flaw considering this IS an fps. You have to lead all your shots and your bullets feel very slow moving across the map, yet they shoot out of your hand quickly, doesn't really make sense. The game has a leaderboard and it does have some replay value based on that but this game needs some tweaks, the enemies need to move a little slower, the hitboxes of the enemies needs to be a bit bigger, your bullets need to move across the map a little faster, and they need to implement a toggle for crosshairs. I can't stand guessing where my bullets are going to go without some reticle. Until these changes are made I just can't really recommend this game. It gets very frustraiting to have your bullets just go through your target, and having to repeat the EXACT same \"sequence\" over and over and over and over again to try and get back to where you were at.

First meaninful review of my life. Helps that i think this game is fraggin awesome.\nDevil daggers is a game that i would say is much like demons souls. It really depends on if you are into games that will take you a while to get used to or not. This game is, in my 2 hours of playing it, a game that im going to have to play constantly and get used to the controls, and the spawns just to get at least 10 seconds farther then i already have gotten to. This is a 5 dollar game that is completly worth the amount of time that would get put into it. \n\nBasically all that you do in Devil Daggers is, you guessed it, throw daggers at devils. There is one level that you will be on for the rest of your patience level allows you to be on it until you close the game to calm down, and its a simple movement scheme, and a right click game. You hold right click to fire a stream of blades, and double tap it to shoot what i call a shotty of blades. The way the game is designed is that every time that you start you start again from the beginning with the same spawns. Everything spawns the same every time that you play the game. However that doesn't make it easy. There is a good chance that in this game you will be finding yourself in impossible situations when you don't clear the arena of enemies. Another thing that most people don't find out as there is no explanation for it, is that you collect these diamond shaped thingys, and once you hit a certain amount you \"level up\" your stream of blades and shotgun as well. \n\nNot gonna say anything about the rest of it cause i haven't even gotten to it yet, but i think that this game is going to be the game that i go to whenever im bored, think i have nothing to play, am waiting for a friend to finish something, or basically whenever i feel like a challenge is needed. 10/10 game.", "timestamp_created": 1477797749, "timestamp_updated": 1477797749, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26304199": {"recommendationid": "26304199", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034799250", "num_games_owned": 480, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 62, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477836437}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun fact: This game is an actual representation of what hell actually looks like.

Its unique blend of pixel/3d brings wave of nostalgia for a gamer like myself, fed intravenously on the first person shooters of the nineties. Also, I love challenging rpgs of any shape or size. This game seemed to be hitting all of the right notes and critic and user reviews seemed to positively reflect this. As soon as I saw it on Humble Bundle, I snatched it up and installed it. Quite a feat considering the towering shadow my steam back catalog casts on me with shameful disapproval every time I turn on my desktop.\n\nThis game was nothing like I thought it would be. It is not an rpg. It does not have a story. There is no customization. I love it. It is brutal. It is terrifying. It is beautiful. The game is so hard you have to quickly mop up your tears of how unfair it all is and decide to try and overcome odds that would make Han Solo go pale. Once you crest that initial sense of crestfallen despair, every small second, literally, is a gaming rush like none I can recall in recent memory. You are Gandalf. You will fall. But you will take the demons with you.\n\nIn pure mechanics Devil Daggers breaks down into a first person shooter where you have one weapon, a magical dagger spell, and your own raw skill. You are then faced against a horde of enemies so massive, countless, and terrifying, in a Lovecraftianly dark fantasy sense, that you know there is no hope for survival. There will be no happy ending. So with a mindset of Spartan martyrdom you begin to relish in the ecstasy of each and every additional millisecond you hold back the gates of hell. This game makes my heart pound, my mind churn faster than humanly possible, and leaves me hopelessly addicted to come back for more.\n\nDevil Daggers isn't for everyone. It is a game that will visually chime with the retro shooter crowd, vibe with the masochistic challenge seeker, brutally scar the dreams of the horror aficionado, and give unadulterated ecstasy to the fps player who thrives on skill alone. One of my favorite games this year, and I'm really more of the Xcom or Skyrim guy.

Little to no unfair randomness, success is entirely up to the player, genuinely difficult instead of marketing difficult *cough* Dark Souls *cough* Darkest Dungeon *coughcough*.\n\nTo sum up the gameplay, the game is an arena/wave based shooter where the only objective is to survive for as long as possible. You can only take one hit and only have one life, your one weapon can fire either a continuous stream of projectiles (think the Nailgun from Quake) or a powerful shotgun blast and can be upgraded by collecting gems. While the arena is completely flat and enemies spawn in the same order every playthrough and only their spawn positions are randomized, the game is chaotic enough that no two runs are quite the same. Despite the arena being flat, the enemies' swarming AI, extreme numbers, mechanics and size come together to shape the boundaries of the arena. The game has one difficulty setting but there are risk/reward mechanics in place to make the game optionally more difficult without instating a difficulty setting.\n\nPros:\nUncompromising design that demands excellent aim, ability to quickly pick up game mechanics and analyze situations, skillful movement and situational awareness from the player. Dark artstyle driven by an engine that faithfully simulates older 3D graphics. The excellent audio and visual design come together to create a palpable atmosphere of malice towards the player, which fits thematically because the game absolutely will hurt you. Over and over. All aspects of the game complement eachother perfectly to create a cohesive theme. The gameplay design is a finely-tuned and inventive mix of both pre-existing and original mechanics that demonstrates an excellent talent for game design from Sorath and it is a game that is absolutely worth discussing and analyzing.\n\nCons:\nMight give you a heart/anxiety attack. No biggie!\nIt's not for everyone. There are no options for casual play, and there probably won't ever be options for casual play as introducing them in a way that doesn't cheapen the core game would likely be a difficult task.\nMight not satisfy you if you want levels, exploration and a huge arsenal of weapons but, then again, [b]you should probably already know that it doesn't have any of that just from the store page[/b].\n\nSolid 5/5, bretty gud.", "timestamp_created": 1477514983, "timestamp_updated": 1477514983, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26211054": {"recommendationid": "26211054", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056067759", "num_games_owned": 1666, "num_reviews": 116, "playtime_forever": 1300, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477519478}, "language": "english", "review": "I've ended up hating myself for not able to progress futher than 3 minutes after wasting almost 14 hours on this.

Easily the best five dollars I have spent. The graphics are nostalgic heavily based on the original quake. Polygon jitter, heavy pixellation filter. A ton of other rendering techniques to produce a game that looks beautiful. I would love the option to toy around with these settings, as after playing for so long the games visual nostalgia wears off. The game has a soundtrack that can be played through the steam music player. It doesn't play in-game but some parts of it do. The soundtrack really sets an uplifting yet corrupted dark atmosphere.\nI personally enjoy playing darksynth music while I play, it makes me feel like a complete badass. Mowing down hundreds of skeletons with my demon arm.\nThis game is a perfect orgasm of nostalgia, and superb sound design, and feeling like a complete badass whenever you beat your high score slowly climbing to the top. Until your reflexes are godlike, wiping the floor with demons, and strafe jumping around perfectly dodging enemies left and right, while managing trying not to fall of the map.\nDo I recommend this game? Fuck. Yes.\n\nSeriously though the games system of progression is so simple, yet bold and rewarding. Slowly figuring out enemies movement patterns, and using them to your advantage in order to reach the highest scores.\n\nListen to some Perturbator on spotify while playing this, otherwise its hard to get into. Seriously darksynth, or synthwave in general will keep you going. Eventually your musle memory will kick in and be doing all the work for you, if you continue playing it will become instinct, and you will just be desicrating everything in sight. Before realizing, holy shit I just did that.\n\nAlso back on the sound design, every enemy has a distinct and different sound so you know what enemy is behind you before you even turn around --- as well a nice touch is the fact that enemies don't randomly spawn, they all have set time periods to spawn. So its not completely random, you have to progressively memorize different enemies spawning in different time periods. This comes in handly with the timer at the top of your screen.\nAlso one of the best things I love about this game is the fact that your hitbox is so small you could fit through things thought impossible. It makes you feel badass running between the tiniest crevace between two enemies.\n\nThis is easily one of the most impressive games, that actually manage to make a 'hardcore 90's shooter right'. Rather than just luring people in with neon-esque colors, and an awesome soundtrack. It actually delivers on the promise, both with the gameplay and visual design.", "timestamp_created": 1477268675, "timestamp_updated": 1491722911, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.484185", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26187269": {"recommendationid": "26187269", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074755902", "num_games_owned": 40, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1882, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 25, "last_played": 1513904160}, "language": "english", "review": "The only game where FOUR SECONDS can raise you 333 ranks on the leaderboard.", "timestamp_created": 1477247186, "timestamp_updated": 1477247186, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 30, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.717242", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26186602": {"recommendationid": "26186602", "author": {"steamid": "76561198132663650", "num_games_owned": 61, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 150, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508670561}, "language": "french", "review": "Que dire de ce jeu ?\nWow wow wow et wow, incroyable jusqu'au bout, 5 euros pour un jeu pixelis\u00e9 ?

You compete not only against your friends, but the entire world.\nThe best part about the leaderboard system (in my opinion), aside from making you feel great, is how replays are implemented. You can go to the leaderboard and click the eye button to download the replay of someone else's game.

It captures the best elements of the arcade and brings it into the PC market. You get one life, an unlimited number of chances, and infinite possibility. The game lasts as long as you do. The only elements present are you, a dagger, a floor, unending darkness, and a plethora of monsters whose only job is to make your life as short as possible.\n\nThe game mechanics are dirt simple. You begin on a large circular platform with a dagger, and from the moment you grasp it, demons begin spawning trying to kill you. You can run, jump, strafe, get a real bunny hop going if you're so inclined, and shoot in two ways - either a endlessly fluid stream of daggers shooting out from your person, or a harsh, brutal shotgun burst that disintegrates anything unfortunate enough to be immediately in front of you. This is really being overly simplistic: there are more mechanics to the game than that, ones that you will realize while playing that lie in enemy behavior... and there are power crystals to be collected that will power up your weapon which belie a dastardly game design decision: the only way to power up your weapon is to stop shooting, because shooting causes crystals to move further away from you. Of course, this is Devil Daggers, and the moment you stop shooting you might regret it big time.\n\nYou don't need to kill your enemies - all you have to do is survive. There are no unlockables, no goalposts, no carrots dangling over your head except for the glory of the leaderboard. Your attempts will be dismal. I can last 3 minutes on a good day; the world record is a bit over 14 minutes. It doesn't take long to learn what Devil Daggers has to offer, but it can take forever to see what you are capable of.\n\nThat's the crux of the game - easy to learn, difficult to master. And it's the hallmark of a good one. Anyone can pick up Devil Daggers and understand it in seconds. Make no mistake - the game is hard, brutally so, but that's the point. You [i]will[/i] die, it's only a matter of how long you can prolong the inevitable. Killing enemies only serves to stave them off until more arrive; and sometimes you will want to kill enemies in certain orders to better strategize how you can move amongst them. If you're good enough, you'll meet your end in a flurry of red, brown and grey monstrosities when you're no longer able to squeeze through the gaps in the hell that engulfs you.\n\nThe game's presentation is slick as hell (no pun intended). Its graphics are pixelated and obscured... a sea of red and and brown and grey and orange that seeps out of the screen like fire from the darkness of your screen. It's a simplified look that matches the gameplay. Monster designs are great: they range from simple skulls to horrific swirling tentacled monstrosities, each of which look like something ripped out of H.P. Lovecraft's work and all of whom want you dead.\n\nSound design is on point here. The music isn't overly complex, but varies between a low-key thumping to hellish industrial music that sounds like it was ripped from the original Quake. The feel, in fact, shares a lot with the original Quake's feel; a very simple 3D game done very well... and speaking of 3D, the surround sound here is fantastic, and you'll want to listen to it no matter how nightmarish it gets, because the different enemies surrounding you give off sounds that will betray their position and give you important information about what is swirling about you when you don't have the time to look.\n\nIn the end, Devil Daggers is incredibly simple; [b]it is a wonderful exercise in the type of game that it is, a masterclass in short, arcade-like arena shooting[/b]. If that type of game isn't for you, though, you're not going to find much to enjoy here. Simply watch the trailers for the game: if it appeals to you, then know that it's worth every penny. If you don't see the appeal, playing it is unlikely to change your opinion.

These people don't care theres basically 0 content to this game and it feels like it was made in a day. You are on a tiny little circular area, no story, and the same flying heads spawn and fly at you. If you are touched, you die. Thats the entire game. The game is made so you die all the time. The heads are faster than you, they multiply at a super high rate. You get hit from the side, from behind by guys you can't see, and from above. They come at you in packs of 15-20. You use the same 1 gun the entire time, with two fire modes. you fight the same 2-3 enemies. Since the longest record in the world is 10-15 min by people that grind this all day for months, expect o last like 1-2 min, mabye a little longer. Then you die and start all over again, no progress made, and not incentives besides getting a higher time. The game isn't intrinsically fun, its just a repetitive grind. But some people really like doing the same thing over and over for hundreds of time for miniscule increases in a number, and thats fine. I don't like wasting my life with that, as i enjoy new and varied experiences that are fun for me. So for that reason I see this as a bare bone games with nothing positive to say about it, there's not even graphic/resolution options,but that's not who this is for clearly. So if you enjoy the mindless repetitive grind with nothing to show for it besides a high score and feeling \"satisfaction\" about yourself, this is for you.

On fait ici difficilement plus minimaliste, une ar\u00e8ne vide, des mobs qui spawnent, une arme, un point de vie et en avant la musique. Le jeu est dur, tr\u00e8s dur (trop dur ? :D), et il ne pardonne absolument pas. La progression rel\u00e8ve principalement de la gestion de crise, les timers des spawns sont fixes, et si vous ne tenez pas la cadence, vous serez d\u00e9pass\u00e9 par les \u00e9v\u00e8nements, et c'est la mort garantie.\n\nOn regrettera un peu une pr\u00e9sence d'al\u00e9atoire un peu trop charg\u00e9e au niveau des patterns de spawn de certains mobs qui est un peu irritante dans un jeu aussi exigeant, mais le skill reste l'\u00e9l\u00e9ment majeur d'un beau run.

Perengano amarra al perro en un poste, luego va presto a ayudar a la se\u00f1ora y empuja el carro fuera de la v\u00eda transitada para que la se\u00f1ora espere una gr\u00faa en un lugar seguro.\n\nLa se\u00f1ora le agradece la ayuda y le regala un dinero para que se compre algo, Perengano lo recibe con benepl\u00e1cito, busca a su perro y contin\u00faa el paseo.\n\nM\u00e1s adelante se topa con una ni\u00f1a llorando, ella llora por su helado que esta en el suelo. Cuando Perengano se le acerca y habla con ella se entera que la ni\u00f1a llora porque no tiene dinero para comprar otro helado, Perengano toma una decisi\u00f3n y entra a la helader\u00eda y compra el helado favorito de la ni\u00f1a con el dinero que le dio la se\u00f1ora y la ni\u00f1a se pone muy feliz. Perengano sonr\u00ede y siente la alegr\u00eda por hacer felices a los dem\u00e1s.\n\nLa suerte le sonr\u00ede a Perengano porque m\u00e1s adelante divisa una estampilla tirada en el suelo y no es cualquier estampilla, es una rara que Perengano no posee en su colecci\u00f3n. Sin tomar precauciones va por la estampilla y en la emoci\u00f3n se enreda con la correa del perro, lo que hace que se caiga y se rompa la correa, el perro sale corriendo tras una perra callejera que esta en la acera den enfrente atravesando la calle atestada de veh\u00edculos. Perengano, asustado va tras el perro sin pensar en lo peligroso de su acci\u00f3n.\n\nCuando Perengano abre sus ojos luego de estar un largo tiempo en penumbras, logra ver una daga flotando enfrente de \u00e9l y m\u00e1s nada a su alrededor, toma la daga como lo \u00fanico que puede hacer por ahora.\n\nInmediatamente es trasladado a una especie de Arena rodeado de la misma oscuridad de la cual nacen horribles criaturas que buscar\u00e1n acabar con \u00e9l, puede defenderse gracias al poder que da la daga pero la cantidad de monstruos que salen de la oscuridad es infinitas y con eso tarde o temprano resulta en la muerte.\n\nAl morir, Perengano vuelve a revivir una y otra vez la experiencia de la lucha y muerte, es un ciclo infinito sin un escape posible. Perengano sabe que muy bien que esta en el infierno y luchar contra la legi\u00f3n infernal es su castigo para toda la eternidad.\n\nPor eso Perengano no se ha vuelto a ver ni escuchar en las oraciones, solo se conoce a sus hermanos, Fulano, Mengano y Zutano.\n\nFIN.\n\nLa historia puede resultar poco cre\u00edble pero algo que si les puedo asegurar es que; el infierno est\u00e1 reservado a aquel que le gusta las canciones de Alejandro Sanz.\n\nMoraleja: no escuchen las canciones de Alejandro sanz XD \n\n\n\nEl men\u00fa contiene los cr\u00e1neos de los que han intentado sobrevivir.\n\nEl juego\n\nEs un shooter de primera persona de la vieja escuela pero condensado en un lugar cerrado y donde no iremos por los monstruos son ellos lo que vendr\u00e1n a ti. El objetivo de Devil Daggers es sobrevivir el mayor tiempo posible, disparando y saltando.\n\nLa jugabilidad es fluida y responde bien a los controles en esos momentos intensos cuando la Arena esta atiborrada de monstruos.\n\nEn Devil Daggers tendremos el poder de la daga, con ella podremos disparar a los monstruos. Para acabar con ellos debemos disparar en ciertos puntos marcados de color rojo (otros no son as\u00ed) para destruirlos. Algunos monstruos soltar\u00e1n un cristal rojo que aumentan el poder de la daga, hay que tomarlas r\u00e1pidamente porque desaparecen con el tiempo.\n\nOtra herramienta \u00fatil para sobrevivir son los saltos, que si logramos calcularlos bien obtendremos un impulso que mejora la velocidad de \"Perengano\", fundamental para esquivar y seguir disparando.\n\nRecuerda que la Arena esta limitada, si llegas al borde te caer\u00e1s y morir\u00e1s, si un monstruo te toca te mueres tambi\u00e9n. No hay escape.\n\n\n\nSojk obstante el titulo del mejor en Devil Daggers, \u00bflo podr\u00e1s superar?\n\nMientras m\u00e1s tiempo dures vivo m\u00e1s monstruos salen, no existe una pausa a la oleada de monstruos, quiere decir que no podemos descuidarnos ni un momento, la carga de adrenalina es constante. Afina bien la punter\u00eda, tus reflejos y la paciencia.\n\nActualmente el record de supervivencia en Devil Daggers es de 15 minutos con 13 segundos. Podemos ver el ranking mundial en todo momento y sentirte mal como yo, que de broma alcanzo el minuto y medio de sobrevivencia. \u00a1No me dejar\u00e9 vencer!.\n\n\n\nAh\u00ed esta mi posici\u00f3n :'(  . Watermelon man es mi usuario de Steam.\n\nGr\u00e1ficos y sonido\n\nEl apartado gr\u00e1fico posee una calidad especial, no s\u00e9 compara con la calidad gr\u00e1fica de Battlefield 1 o de otros v\u00eddeo juegos similares,  Devil Daggers esta realizado con un estilo propio, muy \u00fatil adem\u00e1s para cuando la Arena esta atiborrado de monstruos y Devil Daggers no se \u201clagee\u201d (se ponga lento).\n\n\n\nEl monstruo del inicio, un calamar invertido que pare calaveras flotantes que te persiguen.\n\nLa atm\u00f3sfera est\u00e1 bien lograda y es apoyada por el apartado sonoro, nos har\u00e1 sentirnos en un terrible lugar, solos y desesperados.\n\nCada uno de los monstruos tiene un sonido propio, as\u00ed podremos identificarlos, tambi\u00e9n sabremos qu\u00e9 distancia hay entre tu y el monstruos, importante porque los monstruos llegan por todas partes y nuestra espalda estar\u00e1 desprotegida.\n\nRecomiendo, si te atreves a jugar sin sonido y escuchando tu banda de Death Metal favorito, la experiencia Metalera es magistral.\n\nComo nota curiosa, podemos ver la jugadas de los otros jugadores con solo ir al Ranking y elegir cual demo ver. Algo muy \u00fatil, nos ayudar\u00e1 a mejorar nuestro juego.\n\nConclusi\u00f3n\n\nEs un v\u00eddeo juego sencillo, con un objetivo sencillo, con una dificultad de locura. Carece de historia pero no lo necesita. Devil Daggers est\u00e1 realizado con entusiasmo y busca darte una experiencia \u00fanica en cada partida, no importa cuanto mueras, siempre vas a regresar a jugar.\n\nPuede que Devil Daggers resultar frustrante y quieras lanzar el monitor por la ventana y no lo har\u00e1s porque el juego es un vicio, disfrutar\u00e1s morir (?), recuerda: Perder no es una opci\u00f3n, es la ley.\n\nUn v\u00eddeo juego que sorprende por lo sencillo de la premisa, los gr\u00e1ficos agradables y un ambientaci\u00f3n bien logrado. Si te gusta los v\u00eddeo juegos shooter de primera persona y dif\u00edciles, te lo recomiendo.\n\nPor mi parte me voy a seguir jugando Devil Daggers.", "timestamp_created": 1476038236, "timestamp_updated": 1476038236, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25945531": {"recommendationid": "25945531", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054020357", "num_games_owned": 120, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 758, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512542464}, "language": "english", "review": "One of my favorite games to spend half an hour on at a time.

The game is hypnotic, and before long, every split second  becomes an unconscious decision as you run, jump and shoot in an unrelenting, but ultimately futile attempt to survive.  Less than 0.1% of all players who own the game have actually earned the game's sole achievement - to survive 500 seconds, and I don't know that I ever will. It's a game in which you constantly shoot to fend off the unrelenting legions, but if you don't take your finger off the trigger you will never get any of the quite vital powerups.\n\nThe visuals of [i]Devil Daggers[/i] are quite clearly meant to evoke classic FPS like the original [i]DOOM[/i] and [i]Quake[/i], complete with shaky polygons, Jagged edges and a low resolution. The enemies are all visually distinctive, and have their own audio cues: it's quite vital to wear headphones to survive.

While the graphics are similar to Quake, Devil Daggers is more of an arena survival game where you have to survive enemies constantly spawning than a full FPS game with levels. Despite this, for people who are fans of this genre, this is a pretty fun game and has a lot to offer them, and even fun for FPS fans who want to play something a little different from a normal FPS game. The controls are simple and easy to learn, but have a lot of depth to them as you can bunny hop and rocket jump like in other FPS games. Each enemy is distinct and it can get really crazy and fun when there's a ton of them on screen.\n\nFurthermore, the atmosphere is also really interesting. Its really hellish and creepy. The graphics are also very minimalistic and therefore work really well for this game. All of the monsters look great and the sound design is great too of how each monster has a distinctive noise and they all buzz around you as you around. The weapon, which you can alternate between rapid fire and shotgun blasts on the fly, is really fun to use. One minor problem I found was that its often difficult to get a sense of height when you jump given there is only. Overall the game is really unique and fun in short bursts.\n\nDefinitely worth giving this game a go!", "timestamp_created": 1475745827, "timestamp_updated": 1475745827, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500685", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25879959": {"recommendationid": "25879959", "author": {"steamid": "76561198284618306", "num_games_owned": 555, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 23, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475730826}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6148\u5584\u5305\u5165\u5f97\uff0c\u73a9\u7684\u6bdb\u9aa8\u609a\u7136QAQ\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\uff0c\u8001\u611f\u89c9\u80cc\u540e\u6709\u4e1c\u897f\uff0c\u662f\u4e0d\u662f\u97f3\u6548\u548c\u6c14\u6c1b\u592a\u8be1\u5f02\u4e86\uff0c\u53cd\u6b63\u73a9\u7684\u65f6\u5019\u603b\u662f\u8d77\u9e21\u76ae\u7599\u7629QAQ", "timestamp_created": 1475730958, "timestamp_updated": 1475730958, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25879888": {"recommendationid": "25879888", "author": {"steamid": "76561198148361738", "num_games_owned": 24, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 335, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505512092}, "language": "english", "review": "Very well put together game this has been really fun for the time I have played it.

You play as the bearer of the titular Devel Dagger, which you fire from your hand in either a stream of daggers or shotgun like bursts, and the main objective is to kill every demon SOB that gets in your way and survive as long as you can. \n\nThe gameplay is extremely fast and easy to pickup but takes lightning reaction times and patience to master. Firing daggers in a stream or burst is satisfying and the controls are fluid and allow for all sorts of crazy snap movements and leaps through the omnipresent horde of demons after you. The game only allows you one life per playthrough but don't let that make you think there's not deep gameplay here. The enemies swarm in predatory packs and will strike right when you think you have things in hand. The game will test every bit of old school shooter skills that you have from your reaction time down to your accuracy. It makes a great training tool for twitchy shooters without the constant bickering and taunts of \"git gud\" from rando jerks. Only thing that might make the game a little less appealing for some folks is the lack of controller support. \n\n The visuals immediately remind me of some of Quake and Quake 2's enemies and environments, and by that I mean that they really nail that grim dark gothic look. On top of that, any fairly modern PC should be able to run this game quickly and with maxed settings. Outside of that, the style is fairly true to form for 90's style retro shooters. The textures have that great mixture of grain and vibrance. The models of the enemies are more complex than they would have been had this game been made in the 90's but they're still in keeping with the visual themes of a 90's 3d FPS. \n\nThe audio in this game is really great. There's a soundtrack that comes separately with the game, but you wouldn't neccessarily want to play it while playing the game. The reason I say that is, the sounds that the enemies make and their loudness are a key part of the gameplay as they act as a form of aural radar giving subtle warnings of enemy positions.\nI play it with a 5.1 speaker setup, but the game also has options that allow you to use headphones to great effect. \n\nTL;DR\nDevil Daggers is a great twitch shooter in the style of 90's 3D FPS games.

Let me warn you. This game is Simple, Short, and Difficult. For what it lacks in content, it makes up for in focus and style. Its an endless \"wave based\" Survival FPS. (I don't when the waves start or end... Does it even have waves?) One mode, one purpose, no end.  This game oozes horrific style, the sound design is bone chilling, and the difficulty is proper high. (Shit takes place in hell. Do you think its gonna be easy?)\n\nOk the game looks old at dirt. Like a Doom or Quake. Which to me add to the horrific look and style of the game. Is it for you? I dunno. But the game DOES NOT drop below 60 FPS. Although is has slow motion moments. Do not mistake it for slow downs. It lalso has FOV slider and Fullscreen function.\n\nAlso the game does have 3D positional audio which helps you survive the madness around you by telling you where enemies spawn through audio queues. Its a big help. This game doesn't have much of a soundtrack. I think it has only 1 song... the menu music. So have your own badass hell-slaying Soundtrack at the ready. Since your in hell, make it all the music you hate the most for the full effect.\n\nOther features? Has Leadersboard. Global and Friends. Has Stats tracking, Accuracy, Deaths, Time, Hits, Best, Etc.\nHas fully functional replay system. Beat that league of legends. \n\nAnyway this game is for any hardcore player to just burn a few mins on. For 5 bucks it definitely delievers on it's content. I personality would value this game at 7.99. But im just some rando Interweb dude writing a review thats likely riddled with misspellings and grammatical errors. But if my opinion matters to you, try this game and keep your head up for whatever this dev puts out next.

What I mean by competitive is that you are put on leader boards and obviously if you\u2019re on a leader board you\u2019re tempted to get higher. \n\nIn the options menu there are a few options; those being the input options with the obvious look sensitivity, keyboard options and you can invert y axis. However you can also adjust what hand you want to shoot with so instead of default which is the right hand you can have it on the left hand. This is an option called flash hand but I\u2019m not sure what that is. You also have the audio option which doesn\u2019t have much but there is a HRTF option which is interesting; what HRTF stands for is head-related transfer function which basically is a response that characterizes how an ear receives a sound from a point of source. And finally you have the video options which has the obvious full screen, FOV and v-sync, nothing too special \n\nYou also have a leader boards menu where you can obviously look at other peoples score. Finally in the menu you have the obvious play and exit buttons.\n\nThe game play in this game is reminiscent of the touhou project games which are bullet hell type games akin to this one but this isn\u2019t \u201cbullet\u201d hell, this would be considered an enemy hell type game which is a game type where instead of too many bullets there are too many enemies flooding to your location and a genre I just made up also this game isn\u2019t a top down shooter.\n\nThe enemies in this game are mainly comprised of bone but there are squid enemies which have tentacles. The enemies in the game consist of skulls, skulls with horns, squid type enemies, spider like enemies, centipede demon, a fortress skull thing which I have yet to face and apparently there is a crab boss but I have not got up to that point. There are two types of enemies which can spawn the skull enemies you first see. Those enemies are the squid which is the very first enemy you see which can spawn skulls and one skull with horns the other enemy is a spider which spawns eggs which will hatch if not taken care of. Also on a side note there are different tiers to the skulls and squid and of course each tier will become stronger and have more health.\n\nThere are upgrades in this game which enable you to do more damage but the final upgrade allows for homing bullets. There are also 2 secrets in this game.\n\nOverall this game is a great hell game, it\u2019s similar to dark souls in the difficulty sense but I can defiantly say this is much harder because it is endless.

Survive for as long as possible in a simple arena. As you progress in time, so does the difficulty of enemies. As I am experienced in Arena Shooters, it did not take me long to understand how the game works as well as its mechanics. So is it worth buying this game if there is so little content. Yes it is. Why ? Because the developers of this game have put effort into making the game so fluid and responsive. The enemy variety is also a big plus. \n\nDo not be fooled by the games simplicity however. Without all the fancy things being an issue, this game is brutally unforgiving. It forces you to be extremely twitchy, always on the move, always listening for sound of wails behind you and around you. One mistake could cost you your life and your run. But with every try, you gain more knowledge and more skill and because of its endless runner style, you will always be stuck in that phase of 'oh just one more go and I can beat my score'.

It\u2019s demanding and frightening \u2013 an intensely difficult first-person arena shooter set in some forgotten circle of hell, where survival happens only a handful of seconds at a time and death is constantly looming over your shoulder. But it\u2019s also exhilarating, a frantic high-score chaser that buries hours of rewarding playtime deep within its punishing core for only the most determined players to claw out.\n\nDevil Daggers grounds itself in the look and feel of old-school PC shooters of the \u201890s like DOOM and Quake, then strips the experience down into its purest elements and drops you in without explanation. There are no weapons to pick up, no armor, and besides collectible crystals that power up your dagger shots in tiers, there are no items whatsoever. There are no stats to increase and no levels to beat, either. It\u2019s just you, the daggers that inexplicably fire from your outstretched fingers, and an endless legion of hellspawn battling it out in a dark arena for as long as your skill can carry you, which probably won\u2019t be that long.\nTrying, failing, and trying again is a particularly brutal process in that abyss, where there\u2019s always some new monstrosity threatening to cut your latest attempt short. Hordes of floating skulls and disembodied demon heads spew out of tentacled behemoths, mindlessly giving chase while increasingly grotesque beasts spawn from all sides until the mobs become too overwhelming to fend off any longer.\n\nWith the amount of intensity packed into a single second of gameplay, even a one-minute run can feel like an eternity. The relentless thrill of blasting baddies and the smooth transition between the game over screen and a fresh start (tapping R instantly resets it at any time) make it easy to get sucked in, losing entire hours to the black hole of \u201cjust one more try.\u201d\n\n[h1]The Devil Is in the Details[/h1] \n\n As simple as Devil Daggers\u2019 run-and-gun routine may seem, there\u2019s enough technical detail to make exploring and exploiting its various systems one chaotic hell of a good time. Unlike other twitchy, reflex-based games from recent memory, this one doesn\u2019t spawn your opponents randomly. It might be hard to believe at first, but there\u2019s a consistent order to the waves of enemies that appear. As I played more and more, I grew accustomed to the exact conditions and exact timing of moves that I needed to pull off before the next sequence began.\n\nIf I didn\u2019t have all four skull spawners from the first wave destroyed by the time the first spider shows up, I\u2019d inevitably find myself over-encumbered by the next wave of upgraded spawners. If I didn\u2019t take the spider out immediately after the first centipede spawns, I\u2019d lose all the centipede\u2019s crystals to the spider\u2019s gem-converting powers and have dozens of critter-spewing egg sacs to deal with. Every single error compounds on each other, making things exponentially difficult going forward and adding intense levels of urgency to your every move. Memorizing and maintaining a mental checklist of pixel-perfect motions isn\u2019t necessary to have a good time shooting down demons, but it does make every run feel like a puzzle that I grow closer to understanding each time I return to it.\n\nThere are certain games that the speedrunning community has spent ages chipping away at, learning how to exploit weak spots in their code and defy their boundaries, but also working within their restraints to pull off seemingly impossible gaming feats. Devil Daggers feels like a tribute to that spirit, a throwback to a time when games were simple and uncluttered (but not shallow) and completely unapologetic about their intense difficulty.\n\nThe faithfulness with which it adapts these principles makes Devil Daggers more than just a retro-for-no-reason gimmick that slaps on the unfiltered textures of old games as a cheap nostalgia trip. It earns its low-detail art direction because it also has the appropriate playstyle to boot.\n\n[h1] Raising Hell[/h1]  \n\nDespite the apparent simplicity of the controls and your abilities, there are plenty of ways to stay a step ahead of your enemies. Fluid movement physics allow ample opportunity for mastering new techniques in speed and agility: bunnyhopping to gain a slight boost in speed became a near-constant necessity as I wove my way around deadly spawners, leading swarms of skulls around the arena until I could take them all out with a good clean side shot.\n\nThe Devil Daggers equivalent of rocket jumping (firing a shotgun-like blast of daggers into the floor mid-leap) let me soar over my pursuers, adding some Z-axis movement to the featureless circular arena. Staying on the move is vital, so it\u2019s a huge plus to have smooth controls that make pulling off these quick and cool moves feel great. Your failures will never result from your character not moving or jumping how you told it to. And naturally, you can rebind keys, invert the y-axis, switch to left-handed mode, and adjust your look sensitivity in the options menu for added comfort.\n\nThere are only two ways to use your dagger shots to destroy enemies, but the lack of variety becomes more of an interesting gameplay restraint than something unfairly limiting. Holding down left-click shoots a steady, machine gun-like stream of daggers great for precision aiming, while tapping left-click fires off a shotgun-like blast for dealing with close-range threats. Both firing modes become more powerful after collecting 10 crystals, and then again after collecting 75 crystals, but they don\u2019t change beyond that. Finding the right ways to make such a standard weapon work in the increasingly chaotic realm of Devil Daggers is part of the fun.\n\nThis is especially true in the way this means of attack interacts with the way different enemies move through the arena, and the way the locations of their weak spots affect how you move through it as well. While your typical floating skull can be taken out with one shot, the horned ones take a few direct hits \u2013 or one slower shotgun blast \u2013 to kill. Other threats, like spawners and spiders, have to be shot in their weak spots (clearly marked by those coveted red crystals), creating tricky situational challenges.\n\n[h1]Devil Music[/h1]\n\nDevil Daggers also puts its incredible sound design to practical use. In lieu of a soundtrack, every enemy\u2019s unique, continuous noise \u2013 from the cackling of the skulls to the insectoid click of giant spider legs \u2013 combines over time into a rising chorus of Hell. The more crowded the arena gets, the louder and more intense it becomes. This chilling cacophony doubles as a warning system for your impending doom, a signal to step up your efforts to cull the herd or change your priorities to deal with a new threat. Distinct and deliberate sound design makes it possible to know which enemies are where without even having to look \u2013 a clean way to work around the restraints that come with an arena shooter that\u2019s first-person, rather than top-down. Spatial awareness and mob management are required for survival, and Devil Daggers\u2019 combination of fluid movement and utilitarian sound design acknowledges both beautifully.\n\n[h1]The Verdict[/h1]\n \nDevil Daggers\u2019 stripped-down and distilled essence of first-person shooter intensity will take up a lot of my time in the weeks to come. Every second longer that I survive in its hellish arena is a new record for myself to break, over and over again. It\u2019s a brutal, but brilliant shooter that finds strength in its minimalism, stretching a few seconds of action here and there into endless hours of dreadful fun.", "timestamp_created": 1474660761, "timestamp_updated": 1474660761, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.466790", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25653182": {"recommendationid": "25653182", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056053155", "num_games_owned": 164, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 3554, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512013827}, "language": "english", "review": "Devil Daggers is easily one of the best games on steam.

[u]More on that in a minute. For now, take this line for my score instead of the big ugly, unclear thumbs down.[/u] [/b] \n\n[i]Key to the problem, here, the aggregate \"Overwhelmingly Positive\" score could be misleading in a way. I'd wager that the average score of reviews here would deduce to about 7.5, where \"Overwhelmingly Positive\", in many review contexts, implies a 9 or 10 score. I couldn't say it's [/i]that[i] good. 7.5 or 8 is about what I'd honor the game. People are just forced, in this situation, to choose in a binary of yea or nay, and they're correctly displaying their approval, given that.\nI wouldn't choose a \"neutral\" option if I could, as I don't think that's really the answer I'm looking for, here, either.[/i]\n\n[b]Now, let's discuss the game.[/b]\n\nDevil Daggers is an extremely simple and straightforward first person shooter. Straightforward to the point that they correctly didn't bother with any kind of tutorial. Simple in mostly very welcome and refreshing ways. \n\nYou are not playing for any measure of permanent progress. You die, you start over cold from the beginning enemy, nothing to ever be gained or lost. The only return the game gives you is your best run's position in a global leaderboard, whatever that may be worth to you. [b] [u] The game is entirely balanced on your level of skill in playing it, and it definitely requires some skill to get anywhere. Thus, the large majority of players will likely never even get to see all of the 13 enemy types in the game.[/u] [/b] I will readily admit that I'm not good enough to be great at this game. Oh, well, yeah?\n\nYou play in an arena whose only features are a floor and darkness beyond the radius of your vision. [u] This is the only area of any sort in the game - you'll be playing every run in the same place. To my knowledge, it never even changes in look. [/u] To note, the floor does have an edge that you can fall off of, thus another source of possible death.\nYou will die a lot, and frequently. It's a one-hit-death arcade style game with a constant horde of enemies, no way of augmenting for more health or deflecting taken damage. Do or die, unwaveringly, always.\n\nYou start by picking up a dagger, which sets the game in motion. [u] There is no story, backdrop, or framework of any sort. [/u] You just shoot everything that isn't your hand. I was perfectly happy with this.\n\nRegarding shooting, the game keeps everything blissfully simple. No ammo, and no switching weapons. To have included either of those things would compromise players way too much in what is essentially bullet-hell style gameplay. You have a rapid stream fire that you operate by holding down your left mouse button, and a shotgun type blast shot that you use by just tapping the same button. This scheme works perfectly, allowing you to change shots on the fly. This little dynamic is my favorite thing about the game. You gather diamond things dropped by certain enemies and occasionally your shots heighten into a more powerful, tint-the-screen-neon-nutbars-mode. \n\nThe game has flawless control. You know where everything is on the keyboard right now. You don't need to do any thinking about controls, and the bare necessities of running, shooting, and jumping are the only necessities. This is easily one of the most responsive games I've ever played, and critically well that it is - the game would be an indefensible disaster if it played any less smoothly.\nThe game also runs buttery smooth, extremely light on the system. I never encountered any bugs or even the slightest hiccup in performance. I think you could run the game on a Commodore on its last legs.\n\nThe game has the right sense of challenge. It's difficult - in fact, it gets [i]very[/i] difficult, rather quickly in the sequence, and it's practically unforgiving to new players. But, it's never cheap. Any frustration won't come from unclear mechanics or wonkiness with the mechanics. It'll be your fault, every time, even with the deck clearly stacked horribly against you. This kind of challenge either hits your tastebuds like chocolate or athlete's foot.\n\nAs for that stacked deck, the enemies spawn in the exact same sequence every run played. Some reviews have claimed that they even spawn in the same locations, but I didn't try to track that, myself. All of the enemies that I've seen display extremely simple AI and rudimentary behavior patterns, and the challenge comes not from dealing with any one of them, but with so very many at once, in unrelenting waves. I suppose this all works in one way, making the game something like a shmup to play, which conventionally have set patterns of mobs. You definitely memorize the sequence of enemies for your benefit, as any distance you can gain ahead of the game's programmed timetable of enemies is a huge help. I'm not sure that I cared for this aspect, and it was the first that gave me a feeling that this game is perhaps kind of empty. Fun, to be absolutely sure, but perhaps empty. \n\n[b]Edit: A comment drew my attention to a very valid point about the consistent sequence of enemies - [i]having a set pattern to the spawns in the game does make every run perfectly fair and even for score, and thus leaderboard, concerns.[/i] You get the same exact challenge as everyone else, every time. This is a valid point, and I think it also further helps you to decide if this leaderboard focus makes it a game for you or not.[/b]\n\nI could have rated this game a solid letter grade better had the enemies been fewer, but more dynamically challenging, or if there'd been a game mode beyond the simple survival.\n\nDo I need to say anything about the visuals? I absolutely love the somewhat antiquated Quake/gothic hell look. \n\nThe audio is nearly on par with the visuals, and actually provide gameplay help as you'll follow the eerie groans of enemies to find them in the dark. I love all the sounds and the sound design. Oddly, there's no music to speak of in the game, but I suppose music could've swallowed the enemy spawn signal sounds. Not a major loss, in any event.\n\nAnd, that's all there is to it. What it is is mostly very good. It's just not enough, in my take. I found myself absolutely in love with the way it plays and runs under the hood, just not the game in front of that. [i] [b] [u]I just didn't care about repeating the exact same sequence of many, many, many shallow enemies to break the leaderboard, just to see all the things the game even has to show me.

That's where Humble Bundle comes in. Devil Daggers is included in the new bundle in 1$ tier, so this is one of those premature reviews to warn you about good games on sale.\n\nThe concept of the game is simple - survive for as long as possible in circle arena with no walls, ability to fall of the ledge and swarms of enemies coming at you relentlessly from the get-go. There are no fancy meters, no various multimode weapons. You kill different beasts, gather gems, your shooting dagger gets upgraded. \n\nEsentially, Devil Daggers is a game of skill which guarantees you will get better the more you play it, but it will mercilessly kill you two seconds in the game if you don't move your ass. It's not forgiving any mistakes at all. Call it a bullethell/90's shooter crossover, it feels like someone fitted you with Quake's nail gun in world of Contra. Everything about the gameplay is over the top, but I like how developers integrated strategy into a chaos. At first you will shoot at everything as fast as possible, but later you'll learn it's much more important to move precisely if you want to beat your and Steam's players hi-scores.\n\nThe game's been created using a custom engine with 90's inspired sprites that fit the theme perfectly. Hellish creatures are work of nightmares, a good mixture of different horror cliches and are always fun to blast. Physics are somewhat awkward to newcomers, but after only half an hour, you'll understand how to become even better at aiming without wasting (unlimited) ammo. Sound design follows the ideas of video prett close and the noise is fitting.\n\nAs far as it goes for replayability, Devil Daggers is simple, addictive, I dare calling it an ultimate FPS arcade game. It's beyond simple actually, and while I appreciate that, I would certainly love some kind of mutators, different maps, mods or challenges. Nothing fancy, just a spin on a basic idea of empty arena.\n\nYou don't need more than an hour to see everything in game that's meant to be seen mechanics-wise. It's fun little game that will see me returning to it whenever I'm in need of some brainless fun. Top score for a buck.\n\n***\n\nHey, you've liked this review? Hated it?

So if you play any FPS games you will pick them up fast. The neat thing is the so called gun is the stuff shooting out your fingers ! They have 2 modes Spray and Shot Gun witch is controled by the Mouse 1 button witch is pretty neat. Hold for Spray and Tap for shot gun ! \n\nThe koolest thing is if you look at the scoreboard and you see that eye ( 0 ) icon next to the score you can watch other people's or friend's Replay's  that the score came from! So you can watch how they achieved the score. They also added in a recent patch a Over the Top View also by hitting M when watching a replay  , Witch to me looks neat as all heck ! \n\nIf you love or like FPS games Devil Daggers should without a doubt be in your collection !

possibilit\u00e0 di usare una specie di strafe jump che spesso toglie le castagne del fuoco.

Welcome to Devil Daggers!\n\nDevil Daggers does exactly like it says, inspired by 1990s FPS and arcade games with the gameplay of Quake/Geometry Wars, sending you to damnation in hell in an abyssal arena to face endless legions of skeleton demons. You have 1 purpose... Live as long as you can. More importantly, getting the 1 achievement in this game, which is \"Survive 500 seconds.\" Sounds easy right? Hahahahahahahahahaha wrong! Be happy if you can make it past 100 seconds!\n\nIn DD you only have 1 weapon, the Magic Dagger. As you progress, certain enemies will drop \"Gems\" which after collecting so many will power up your dagger to shoot more daggers and deal more damage. As you would guess, progressing farther also means the gets even harder, spawning in more enemies at a time, or spawning in a new enemy type. There is 13 different enemies in this game, all have really unique models, and all produce their own unique sound, so you can have an easier time keeping track where certain enemies are. You have no health, you get hit once, you die. Standing still will get you killed in this game.\n\nWhen you complete your run, you are given your score, which is how long you lasted. My best record after numerous attempts was 195.9962. The cool thing is your best run is saved as a replay, so your friends can view it, or other people can look on the leaderboard and view your run. This idea is cool, as you can watch how other people played and learn off them to get farther. After watching the top players, I've determined that I will never be that skilled in being able to make it to the final boss, and beating the 500 seconds achievement. (Also convinced the few top ten that made it over 700 are aimbots based on how they move and aim.)\n\nFor a game that was coded from the ground up in a custom engine, this game runs smooth and is rock solid! Runs at a silky smooth 300FPS and does not lag or glitch ever. There is an FOV slider (which I guess wasn't in the game originally) that goes from 75-120. The game boots up fast and loads almost instantly. There is also a soundtrack which was added in later, and it's metal as f**k!\n\nThis is a fun little game that just makes me go back and \"play one more round\" till my adrenaline gets way too high, and have to stop and take a break. I would play more, but I just don't think my heart can handle it. Some people would argue that there isn't much \"Content\" in this game, but this is for those hardcore old school FPS fans that love that extra challenge. For the $5 it's a great buy and great to support the Dev. I would LOVE to see the Dev make a full game similar to QUAKE, as they clearly have the know how.\n\nPros:\n- Fast Paced Arcade FPS\n- Great Graphics\n- Great Monster Designs\n- Great Sound Effects\n- Leaderboards\n- Very Well Optimized\n- Hardcore Difficulty\n- Only Worth $5\n- 1 Achievement (Hard as hell)\n\nCons:\n- No Steam Cards\n- Some may not like this as it's only the 1 gamemode.\n- 1 Achievement (Hard as hell)\n\nSome may not like it, but like I said, I would love to see what the Dev makes up next.

Sometimes I'm in a situation where I think I should've died, but the enemy somehow didn't touch me. Other times I think I should've been fine, but instead die.\n* The skulls follow a certain pattern, which they change in the worst possible moment.

But I would really like you to make something like a campaign mode (even without any plot, which I myself would really like to try to come up with). Since survival for as long as possible is the goal, players try to abuse some mechanics to make trash mobs spawn as least as possible. This can be seen in top players replays. I would really like to beat bosses and clear stages for something more, than just time. I really do have some Ideas for this mode, but I'm so bad at programming I can't modify game on my own, so...

Review: [/b]\nOkay so in my opinion this game is fantastic, but I'm going to get the bad stuff over and done with for the people reading it that are slightly sceptical. \nOne of the things I've noticed in a lot of the negative reviews of this game is the fact that people don't like the lack of diversity: this is true, there is only one map in this game, which is a relatively small arena with no obstructions and nothing to stop you from falling off. I can see why people would think this game is bad because of that and I would say to people who are after a game with a story and lots to do (as much as I like those games myself) this is probably not for you.This is a game where all you can really do is strive to defeat your last score, and maybe your friend's scores, nothing more beyond that. \nThat is simply how the game is and I don't believe it's right to criticise it for that, but I also don't want people to buy this thinking otherwise. \n \nNow for some positive stuff. The reason I got this game is because it reminded me of DooM. The ambience of the sound effects and the way things fade into the dark and the demonic theme of it all just makes my soul melt. I genuinely think it's an indie gem. It reminds me of Doom a lot, which is another plus. The movement is fluid and feels natural, and it doesn't overburden you on buttons; in fact it's very minimal with only WASD, Spacebar and right mouse button needed. But that in itself is enough to make the game diverse. The two modes of firing are pretty simple, but all you really need. I adore the shotgun as it gives me more DooM flashbacks. \nOne of the things that took me a while longer to notice was the surround-sound effect it has with all the sound effects in the game. It makes a lot more sense why it has music, as I've learnt to depend on the sound of spires spawning to locate them and get a head start on destroying skulls. It's very subtle but it's a really nice touch, and way more thought went into that game than I originally imagined. \nNow I thought I'd have more to say but I think my brain died. A quick conclusion is: pretty graphics (if you're into darkness and demonic sculls), cool sound effects (if you're into hearing abyssal whispers, eldritch hisses, and demonic roaring), smooth controls (if you're into feeling like you're gliding through hoards of your worst nightmare and love closing gaps like a graceful dagger-toting falcon), cool-ass models for enemies (if you like skulls and other such like), and great gameplay (if you like dying a whole lot). \n", "timestamp_created": 1468433580, "timestamp_updated": 1468433580, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24283978": {"recommendationid": "24283978", "author": {"steamid": "76561197977643673", "num_games_owned": 1095, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 63, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484251239}, "language": "english", "review": "Difficult and addictive.\n\nGraphics are simple and effective.", "timestamp_created": 1468362362, "timestamp_updated": 1468362362, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500906", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24283933": {"recommendationid": "24283933", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061915226", "num_games_owned": 78, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1443, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495317774}, "language": "english", "review": "I recinded my previous review of this game, and am now posting a new one due to the fact that at the time of the last review, I had not yet learned just how much better you can get at this game dispite seeminmgly impossible odds, the odds are still just as ridiculous, of course, but at least I'm doing well enough to play more of the game, and it is rather fun.", "timestamp_created": 1468362143, "timestamp_updated": 1468362143, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480210", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24281932": {"recommendationid": "24281932", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016906163", "num_games_owned": 52, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1567, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504456793}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041a\u0420\u0423\u0413\u041e\u041c \u041a\u0420\u041e\u0412\u042c, \u041c\u042f\u0421\u041e, \u0414\u0415\u041c\u041e\u041d\u042b \u041b\u0415\u0417\u0423\u0422 \u0418\u0417\u041e \u0412\u0421\u0415\u0425 \u0429\u0415\u041b\u0415\u0419!! \u0414\u041e\u041b\u0416\u0415\u041d... \u0423\u0411\u0418\u0422\u042c... \u0412\u0421\u0415\u0425...\n\n\u041e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u043f\u0440\u0438\u044f\u0442\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430, \u0441\u0442\u043e\u0438\u0442 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0438\u0445 \u0434\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0433. 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1468355266, "timestamp_updated": 1468355266, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.486682", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24281036": {"recommendationid": "24281036", "author": {"steamid": "76561198310275574", "num_games_owned": 349, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 227, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504948535}, "language": "english", "review": "This game feels like a last boss battle of something like Doom with you having only so much health, that you'll die from the next hit.

The game is perpetually intense and the only real break from the action is dying and waiting a few seconds before jumping back in.

Do you SEE it?! \nWell, don't just assume the game is bad because I do not recommend it.  \nIn many ways, in what it sets out to do - this is a perfect game. \nEven if it does involve a lot of skeleton violence.\n\nPros/cons can be found rapidly by searching for tildes. ~ Not that you should foolishly skip my words of wisdom..!\n\nSeriously, you shouldn't, especially if you can't get the game running and are looking for another possible solution. Search for the *asterisks* to see how I was able to get it working. \nAfter all, though I can't recommend it, not even I'd be so awful as to want you to be unable to play a video game!\n\n... Let's get right to the meat of it. Arena shooters aren't for everyone. I don't want to refund this because the gameplay, the atmosphere, the score, the sounds, the art are all deeply tied to my memories and beliefs of what a game should be.  \nAnd I desperately want to see an actual game, with levels and maps and more then 1.5 weapons in it, but this game that ain't.\n\nAnd here's the cardinal sin, the one that makes my bones rattle in utter discontent.\nI don't think it's hard. No, I'd argue this is essentially a tech demo; the game ratchets up the foes the longer you survive, but the waves are largely predictable, meaning that as long as you pay attention, you should be able to learn the skills the game requires very quickly.\nMy time as I posted this review is six minutes of gameplay time, and I already feel it's outstayed its welcome.\n\nQuite a few people would disagree, which is fine, and here's where it gets important. \n\nDo you like arena shooters?\nDo you you prefer a small box-arena with guaranteed enemies to a series of levels?\nAre you worried about spending seconds getting back to where you were, so you can see new formations or new enemies or hear new bits of background ambience?\nDo you care about leaderboards?\n\nIf you like the thrill of one-upping your best score, seeing your numbers rise above someone elses' on the leaderboards, and aren't bothered by a lack of variety, go for it!\nBut if you don't... There's nothing. You'll learn all the skills necessary to be good a few deaths in, there aren't really any new weapons, and as beautiful as it is in every respect, that's not a reason to get the game.\n\nNo, I won't refund it; I'd kill to see a proper game with alien skyboxes and gritty kills in this style, hear music that puts the original Quake soundtrack to shame, ramps up the difficulty through level design and item starvation rather then just expecting you to not pay attention. I'd like to see a good, old-fashioned FPS.\n\n... And this isn't.\n\n~ Pros:\n\n- Beautiful, in every sense of the word.\n- Smooth, when you can get it to run; though there's only one real weapon, it handles with the satisfaction you find in Doom, Heretic, Quake, etc.\n- Sound design is perfect and almost every new enemy has a sound or light cue to react to.\n- If you're not good at adapting rapidly, this'll be one hell of a ride.\n\n~ Cons:\n\n- If you don't care about leaderboards and aren't driven by your own desire to surpass your high score, you'll probably get good enough to see all the game has to offer very quickly.\n- Difficulty dependent on the surprise of new enemies and lack of familiarity; once you can live past a wave, you'll live past it again unless you stop paying attention.\n- The arena size seems less dangerous then it should (underutilized?), at least after you get a sense of how big it is.\n- Who would just kill a skeleton that fires smaller skeletons..?\n\n*GETTING THE GAME TO RUN*\n\nSome of you may wish to play Devil Daggers, but find yourself backstabbed by technical difficulties. \n\nThe forums recommend enabling the 2015 leaderboards, but that didn't work for me, and I almost didn't play the game at all. But I've had a few problems with steam versions of games. \n\nIf you have an integrated and switchable graphics card, try this:\n\n- Manually set your graphics card for dd.exe to High Performance. Make sure your settings are at the highest possible setting, too. (Don't do this if you're scared of your computer. To conquer the arena, you must first conquer fear itself.)\n\n- Validate the game.\n\n- Run, and enjoy.", "timestamp_created": 1467950560, "timestamp_updated": 1468095042, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508747", "comment_count": "15", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24172742": {"recommendationid": "24172742", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023517986", "num_games_owned": 976, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 955, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476357847}, "language": "english", "review": "There's \"git gud\" and then there's \"I'm a sadomasochist and love enduring random/bullshit/unavoidable deaths.\"\n\n666/10 would play again while bathing in goat blood and summoning demons from the Ars Goetia.", "timestamp_created": 1467947027, "timestamp_updated": 1467947027, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480480", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24172617": {"recommendationid": "24172617", "author": {"steamid": "76561198254326386", "num_games_owned": 59, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 150, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511278388}, "language": "english", "review": "I barely have any time into this game at the time of this review, but I can say that I would reccomend it.  it might not REALLY  be worth the $3+ dollars I paid for it, but I am pretty cheap.

Just be careful not to get it when you have some work deadlines or, say, exams :D", "timestamp_created": 1467931797, "timestamp_updated": 1511549812, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497512", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24168102": {"recommendationid": "24168102", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078355927", "num_games_owned": 218, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 700, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498324016}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041a\u0410\u041a \u0416\u0415 \u042f \u041e\u0411\u041e\u0416\u0410\u042e \u041f\u04183\u0414\u0418\u0422\u042c \u0401\u0411A\u041d\u042b\u0425 \u0414\u0415\u041c\u041e\u041d\u041e\u0412 \u041d\u041e\u0413\u0422\u042f\u041c\u0418 \u0418\u0417 \n\u0420\u0423\u041a\u0418 \u041f\u0423\u041b\u0415\u041c\u0415\u0422\u0410-\u0414\u0420\u041e\u0411\u041e\u0412\u0418\u041a\u0410. \u0410\u0410\u0410\u0410\u0410\u0410\u0410\u0410\u0410\u0410\u0410\u0410\u0410 \u0421\u0423K\u0410 \u0415\u0411 \u0422\u0412\u041e\u042e \u041c\u0410\u0422\u042c \u041eX\u0423\u0415\u041d\u041d\u041e!", "timestamp_created": 1467929355, "timestamp_updated": 1467929419, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.341901", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24167947": {"recommendationid": "24167947", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025852780", "num_games_owned": 231, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 134, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477959275}, "language": "english", "review": "OMG - so much fun.

[/u]\n\nAnother simple game that's suppose to \"brings you back to the old days\" while also implying that it's that dreaded word; \"Classic.\" Absolutely disgusting. But is Devil Daggers able to back itself up on its claim?\n\n[u] Gameplay [/u]\n\nYou're thrust into combat almost immediately after grabbing your titular devil dagger. Faced with hordes of demonic monstrosities and stuck on a circular arena, you're forced to fight to the death in an excellently designed game. Devil Daggers only has one game mode, which is to survive, and it makes sure you're on your toes at all times. Your weapon feels responsive and powerful, upgrading when you've killed enough enemies and collected gems, and your character moves with agility and responsiveness. Imagine playing a DOOM style game, but with only one weapon and hordes of scumbags to mow down. Absolutely hectic fun that any one will get addicted to in no time.\n\n[u] Graphics [/u]\n\nDevil Daggers looks pretty good for what it is. The models are very well done and nothing is particularly hampering to gameplay. It may get a bit painful to play for extended periods of time though. With no pause button and some pretty flashy lights, you'll quickly grow tired of looking at the screen. Play in moderation, kids.\n\n[u] Overall [/u]\n\nAbsolutely a must buy if you're looking for an excellent time waster. With fun, enticing, and simple gameplay, and a functioning high score board, Devil Daggers manages to go back to our arcade roots and give us a kickass experience. Pick it up, whether at full price or on sale.

[/i]\n\n\n\nWho remembers the arcades?\n\nAgain, I start my review with that particular sentence. The \n\nlast time was with Blue Estate: The Game, which too gave me \n\nnostalgic memories of the arcade-cabinets that I frequently \n\nvisited as a kid.\n\nThis time though, the memories center towards the competetive \n\naspect of those times. Trying my damnest to top my friends \n\nhigh-scores on particular game and Devil Daggers reminds me of \n\nthat a great deal. Moreso than Call of Juarez: Gunslingers \n\nArcade-mode, which is another game currently waiting for a \n\nreview.\n\nBut enough of nostalgic babble, let's have a look at the game.\n\n\n\nDevil Daggers is a fast-paced 1st person survival game, where \n\nyou go against an endless horde of demonic monstrosities. Each \n\nwith their own behaviour, form and dissonant sounds.\n\nMechanically, the game is rather simple. Survive as long as \n\nyou can, whilst collecting gems to upgrade you attack in small \n\nincrements. Avoiding all damage..\n\nYes, all damage. You die in one hit, which I could argue \n\nshifts the category towards bullethells.. But, let's not get \n\ninto that.\n\nAvoiding all damage and surviving as long as possible, whilst \n\nthe amount of gathering monsters slowly increase.\n\nAnd you will die, but don't let that stop you. It's part of \n\nthe fun...\n\n\n\nGraphically, the game has been frequently compared to either \n\nold Quake or Heretic series.. And I do see why they'd say \n\nthat, the jaggedy polygonal graphics with pixelated meshes \n\ndoes invoke some feelings of Quake and to some extent Doom and \n\nHexen.\n\nHowever, even as that graphical style does give the game an \n\nunique aesthetic. It does cause enemies in large packs or \n\nfar-away, appear as an almost solid mass of muddy pixels. \n\nWhich does irk me to an extent, I would like an option to have \n\nan high-res pack, for the sake of player-convenience.\n\n\nThat's the only minus point that I have to give for this game.\nApart from the obvious caveat that this is purely an arcade-\n\ngame, purely single-player and not multiplayer.\n\n\n\n\n[b] SUMMARY [/b]\n\nDevil Daggers is an enjoyable fast-paced arcade-game. Easy to \n\npick up, however not so easy to master.

One, this game is strictly a survival game. There is no story, there is no multiplayer, there is nothing but one single mode, survival. Two, Devil Daggers is probably the hardest game ever created. The first 20 deaths you experience will probably be within the first 45 seconds of the game. If you don't mind dying over and over and over and over just so that you can finally last over 1 minute then go ahead and buy this game. If you're easily frusterated, stay far far away. My only compalint is that the game is almost too hard. I haven't been able to experience a fraction of what this game has to offer because of not being able to last long enough.

Developed by Sorath, [i]Devil Daggers[/i] makes the [i]Dark Souls[/i] series more than proud. \n\n[b][u]Gameplay[/u][/b]: It's a first person ... shooter? Shooter. Yes. You're shooting ... daggers? ... out of your hand. Against a horde of hellish monsters. The objective is to survive for as long as you can, and score as much as you can in that time. This game is hard. Don't underestimate it. It is impossibly hard. There's only one achievement for the game. But I could safely say that this game has an achievement that deserves to be called an achievement.\n\n[b][u]Visuals[/u][/b]: Nothing impressive. It looks like one of those 90's first person classics. It's just red and black colours all over to bring out a very hellish, very grim atmosphere. But it fits. So, no problems there.\n\n[b][u]Mechanics[/u][/b]: It's a first person shooter like the earlier [i]Doom[/i] games, so there's no ADS involved, it's a basic run-&-gun game. The movement and shooting are smooth as hell. Unfortunately, there's no controller support, but who the hell needs one for a game like this? There's no map. It's just an area of darkness with a boundary. Leaderboards are present so you could watch people's replays, compare scores with your friends, as well as the world. Yes, it's a competition with this one, too. \n\n[b][u]Music/Soundtrack[/u][/b]: Pssh. Please. Unless you count hooting of creatures, wailing of skulls and the sound of your own death as music to your ears, there is none. I think the developers would rather want you to focus on not dying in the game, use all your senses and whatnot.\n\n[b][u]Verdict[/u][/b]: Do I recommend this game? [b]Hell yes![/b] But, of course, there are a few exceptions:\n[list]\n[*]For the ragers, a flat no.\n[*]For the stuck-up achievement hunters who have aced every single game they have, you could try, but you will break down physically, psychologically, emotionally, and socially - Literally. That achievement will be your death. \n[*]For the rest, buy it!

Replays of your or top player's best run can be viewed at any time, allowing you to take a break and learn some mad strats.\n\nGameplay is simple, but with some lightly hidden mechanics like strafe jumping and rocket jumping. Hold down left mouse to shoot a constant stream of daggers, or simply click to unleash a flak cannon style blast. This is not a hitscan game, so you'll need to lead your shots ahead of moving enemies or watch as your shots miss by a wide margin.\n\nDespite appearances, this game operates on timed scripted spawns that are always the same except for the locations they appear. This basically means you are always learning with every death, without having to worry about totally random enemy waves. \n\nDevil Daggers and DOOM 4 mark a cool trend in 2016 to bring back the old style of shooters, but with their own unique modern twist.

I bought it and liked it so much that I played an entire hour of it in one sitting and if you get/have the game you will know that that is quite remarkable. In the game, you are a person trapped in the abyss standing on a large circle platform with a powerful magical dagger that shoots red crystals. These red crystals are what kills the many types of demons thrown at you each with their oun traits. There are two main types of attacking abilites and a third, special one. Rapid fire, burst fire and homing missles (Special). There is a small leveling ststem that upgrades your weapon as you kill more enemies but resets when you die. This level system quenches the thirst for a progression system. The point is to survive as long as possible with the game becomming more challenging as you survive. It is not only the most anoying and difficult game I have ever played but also one of the most unique. Its lack of soundtrack and backsplash create an amazing and dark atmosphere which fits amazingly in this game. I reccoment this game for players looking for a challenge above and beyond what they are capable of. However the game has a very terrifying demon theme and is not reccomended for younger players at all. \n\nPros:\n - Bug free as far as I can tell\n - Extremely unique\n - Provides global leaderboards with replays of all players high scores\n - Challenging\n - Amazing price for what it is\n - Only takes up about 220Mb of storage\n - Well-Created Atmosphere\n - Balanced\n - FUN!\n\nCon: \n - Only one steam achievement\n\nOverall, well morth the money and will be spending tons more time on it in the future.

Stay alive for as long as you possibly can while fighting off Hell's armies in a dim, dark, purgatorial arena, with nothing but your rapid-fire daggers and your (hopefully sharp) reaction times. Harkening back to late 90's games such as Quake, the movement system is extremely satisfying. Of course, you have standard movement with WASD and your mouselook, but once you get the general hang of the game, you can introduce bunny-hopping and dagger jumping into your repetoire. These systems reward you with speed and manueverability that can turn average, 'nothing special' runs into challenges to the world's top players. While not as snappy as one might like, its movement system just feels right at home here, and is immensely satisfying. \n\nTruth be told, I'm not even that big of a fan of wave-based survival games. Sure, I've played and enjoyed games like Geometry Wars, (which, admittedly, is very similar to Devil Daggers IMO, just from an entirely different perspective,) but none of them have held my attention quite like Devil Daggers has. While a hefty portion of this addictive nature comes from the game just being fun as all hell, it's also partly due to the leaderboard system. Quite a few friends of mine picked up the game when it came out, and we slowly started ramping up our challenges to each other. Thirty second survival became seventy, seventy became one-twenty, and so-on and so-forth. I've swore up and down, I've shrieked like a small child upon near misses with skulls, and have had my feet tapping in anticipation beneath my desk, all because my best time was MILLISECONDS off my friend's best, and I was [i]so[/i] close. Admittedly, they've all moved onto other games, and I finally hold the crown at 427 seconds. But... given that my record is about 70 seconds shy of the coveted Devil Dagger status, I can't just stop there, can I?\n\nIn addition to being one of the most fun games I've played this past year, it's an amazing looking and sounding game. I'm a complete fanatic for PSX-style graphics. The blocky style, abysmal render distance, primitive lighting systems and poor aliasing admittedly looks awful by today's standards, but it's incredibly charming to anyone who grew up with a Playstation One in their home. Devil Daggers effortlessly merges the look of a late-run PSX game with an aesthetic similar to Quake and a mid-90s Slayer album cover, and it always looks fantastic. At this point, with some research, I could probably write a scientific paper on why I love this visual style so, so much, but I'll keep that toned down for this.\n\nIf there's one aspect of Devil Daggers that absolutely must be talked about, it's the immaculate sound design. A satisfying sound is what makes the difference between a weapon being limp and forgettable, or powerful and an icon of an entire genre (see: the Super Shotgun from Doom II, or the AWP from any of Counter Strike's iterations.) Or, as another example, making the presentation of in-game reward boring and unfulfilling, or something that straight-up makes your day upon finding it. Sound is a big deal to me in just about every medium, but video game sound design, (especially in shooters,) is [b]extremely important[/b]. Devil Daggers sets a bar for what audio in video games should be. \n\nEvery crunch, splatter, and skitter has an unsettling bite to it that is distinct and clearly heard amidst the madness of the arena. Each enemy has a 'chatter' for when they are encroaching on your person, and getting dangerously close to ending your run for good. Enemy spawners have an ominous, low hum or a disgusting chitter to signify where they're coming from, or that yes, they are still there. Death rattles and screeches offer a triumphant, yet haunting finality to taking down a larger enemy. The sound of firing daggers grows from a machine-like drone to shrill screams of the damned with each upgrade you gain. And of course, above it all, Devil Daggers incorporates a positional 3D surround sound system, assisting the player in knowing where their next threat is without much difficulty. Everything is accounted for, it's satisfying, unsettling, and so, so good.\n\nTo make a send-up to 90's FPS games can be done by just about anyone with a Unity engine license. To make that same tribute by building your own engine, creating sound and art that is equally impressive and sinister, and designing one of the most immersive and entertaining arena shooters I've ever seen takes someone like Matt Bush, who did an incredible job with Devil Daggers as a whole. \n\nAt the end of the day, you can get either Devil Daggers or a nice burger for five US dollars.

LoL)\n\nJuly 2016: edit review to be positive again (sorry about my waffling like this!  LoL)\n\nI am changing my review back to being positive because of the July 5, 2016 new version of Devil Daggers.    Good job by the developer to do this.\n\nThings seem so much better now.\nAnd for some reason, because of this new DD, I am getting longer runs.\n\nIn the original DD, the longest run I had was 100.xxxx and I was constantly running for my life.\n\nIn the new DD, my first run was immediately 135.xxxx and I can now actually see and hear better.   As of July 9, 2016, my longest run in the new DD is already 160.xxxx\n\nSo I am not sure if the new DD is 'easier' in the first part or I am just getting better (or a little bit of both?).  I have also noticed that all my friends times are longer in the new DD too!\n\nBut, I have seen that the later stages of the new DD does look 'harder' - and that is fine.\n\nThe monsters are great, the sounds are great, the movement is great.\n\nGame is easy to play and it is now fun to see improvements in your length of runs.\n\nOne of the best features is the playback abilities in the game.\nYou can re-watch your run AND you can watch any other person's run!  You can even slow down or speed up the playback!   Very nice feature.\n\nAnd the in-game leader boards are great.   Because there is not only the overall leader board, but a 'friends' leader board.   So you can see all your steam friends and their progress, etc.  You can watch their runs (as mentioned above).   Great in-game feature.\n\n(note: if your steam profile is set to 'private' or 'friends only', then you will not see your friends on the in-game friends leader board unless you do this:  Temporarily make your profile 'public', go into the DD game, then see if your friends are now in the friends leader board.  If they are, then exit the game and go back to making your profile be what it was before ('private' or 'friends only').", "timestamp_created": 1462852690, "timestamp_updated": 1468083414, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22889616": {"recommendationid": "22889616", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074952403", "num_games_owned": 179, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 89, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506660490}, "language": "english", "review": "After playing this game for roughly one hour, I can safely say that you should stop reading reviews and just buy the game.", "timestamp_created": 1462849400, "timestamp_updated": 1462849400, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.624008", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22889443": {"recommendationid": "22889443", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018485266", "num_games_owned": 579, "num_reviews": 151, "playtime_forever": 86, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462848530}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u597d\u73a9,\u4f46\u96be\u5f97\u8981\u547d..............\n\n\n\u672c\u6765\u4e0a\u9762\u90a3\u51e0\u4e2a\u5b57\u5c31\u80fd\u6982\u62ec\u8fd9\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u4e86,\u4e0d\u8fc7\u8fd8\u662f\u987a\u4fbf\u628a\u73a9\u6cd5\u7b80\u5355\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e00\u4e0b\u5427\n\u957f\u538b\u5de6\u952e\u4e3a\u673a\u67aa\u578b\u7684\u5c04\u51fb,\u7531\u4e8e\u5b50\u5f39\u98de\u884c\u901f\u5ea6\u8f83\u6162,\u7a0d\u8fdc\u4e9b\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u90fd\u8981\u9884\u5224\u8ddd\u79bb\n\u53cc\u51fb\u540e\u4e3a\u6563\u5f39\u653b\u51fb,\u5bf9\u725b\u89d2\u9ab7\u9ac5\u6709\u6bd4\u8f83\u597d\u7684\u6548\u679c\n\u914d\u5408\u7a7a\u683c\u952e,\u5bf9\u5730\u9762\u4f7f\u7528\u6563\u5f39\u540e\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u706b\u7bad\u8df3\u7684\u6548\u679c,\u4f46\u6df7\u6218\u4e2d\u6211\u4e00\u6b21\u4e5f\u6ca1\u53d1\u6325\u4f5c\u7528\u8fc7\n\n\u5927\u578b\u654c\u4eba\u9700\u8981\u5bfb\u627e\u7ea2\u8272\u5b9d\u77f3\u624d\u80fd\u51fb\u5012,\u843d\u4e0b\u7684\u5b9d\u77f3\u5728\u505c\u6b62\u653b\u51fb\u540e\u4f1a\u88ab\u5438\u8fc7\u6765\n\u6536\u96c610\u9897\u4f1a\u8fdb\u5165\u5b50\u5f39\u65f6\u95f4,\u7b97\u662f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ed9\u73a9\u5bb6\u7684\u6551\u547d\u798f\u5229\n70\u9897\u6211\u65e0\u80fd\u4e3a\u529b,\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u6709\u4ec0\u4e48\u6548\u679c............\n\n\u4e00\u822c\u7c7bRogue\u9700\u8981\u53cd\u590d\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u9664\u4e86\u73a9\u5bb6\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u63d0\u9ad8\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u6709\u5c31\u662f\u4e0d\u65ad\u63b7\u9ab0\u5b50\u7684\u649e\u8fd0\u6c14\n\u800cDD\u7684\u8fd0\u6c14\u6210\u5206\u53ef\u4ee5\u8bf4\u5b8c\u5168\u6ca1\u6709\uff0c\u73a9\u5bb6\u80fd\u505a\u7684\u5c31\u662f\u5728\u65e0\u6570\u6b21\u6b7b\u4ea1\u91cc\u603b\u7ed3\u7ecf\u9a8c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6c34\u51c6\n\u5f80\u5f801\u5206\u949f\u4e0d\u5230\u4e00\u5c40\u7684\u9ad8\u901f\u8282\u594f\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u201c\u4f11\u95f2\u201d\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u95f2\u6687\u65f6\u597d\u597d\u6b7b\u4e2a\u8fc7\u763e\n\n\u77ed\u671f\u5185\u8fd9\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u6210\u5c31\u591a\u6570\u73a9\u5bb6\u662f\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u5f00\u4e86,\u672c\u4f5c\u552f\u4e00\u7684\u6210\u5c31\u662f\u5728\u79ef\u5206\u699c\u4e0a\u62ff\u6700\u9ad8\n\u800c\u76ee\u524d\u63a5\u8fd1700\u79d2\u7684\u6210\u7ee9\u5bf9\u6211\u6765\u8bf4\u662f\u65e0\u671b\u7684\uff0c\u770b\u90a3\u5168\u7403\u89e3\u73870.1%\uff0c\u8c8c\u4f3c\u5c31\u8fde\u4fee\u6539\u5668\u548c\u6210\u5c31\u89e3\u9501\u673a\u4e5f\u6ca1\u7528\u7684", "timestamp_created": 1462848218, "timestamp_updated": 1462848218, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 41, "votes_funny": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.784694", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22888581": {"recommendationid": "22888581", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061740176", "num_games_owned": 392, "num_reviews": 106, "playtime_forever": 164, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1469991312}, "language": "english", "review": "Devil Daggers is a blast from the past. For those who don\u2019t know what Devil Daggers is, it is a first person shooter reminiscent of 1990s shooters in terms of gameplay and graphics. It is arcadey, fast-paced, and unbelievably difficult. It has no storyline, but instead a series of challenges that spawn as you progress. Is this new five dollar indie game worth your time? Let\u2019s find out!\n\nThe gameplay of Devil Daggers is simple, yet effective. The ability to shoot daggers from your fingertips in spreads and in automatic mode allow for tactical decisions when staring down a horde of demonic skulls chasing after you. Your spread shot can literally launch you off the ground should you choose to aim at the floor and take flight. After you collect enough gems, you can power up and go from shooting a few daggers to unleashing torrents of daggers that will drown smaller enemies in a wave of death. You can even fall off the map which is small enough to present space management as your biggest challenge. This game keeps you on your toes, always succeeding one tough challenge with an even tougher one. It is a very intense game but also one that keeps pushing you to beat your high score again by at least one second. It all plays exactly like you\u2019d want this kind of shooter to play.\n\nGraphically, this game is not what you\u2019d expect from 2016. The graphics are a throwback to the 1990s and they do the job well. If you\u2019re a graphics nut then avoid this at all cost, but if you appreciate spooky art styles and retro graphics then this game is just right for you. The sound effects complement the aesthetic very much. As you power up, the intensity will increase as the sound of what reminds me of a demon screaming blares in your ears. As you shoot more daggers the sound of them leaving your fingers grows louder. If it is possible to match an art style with a style of sound, this game pulled it off. The atmosphere is gripping and the immersion is deep for a game that most players lose within the first 60 seconds.\n\nUnfortunately, there is no story mode or multiplayer functions present in Devil Daggers other than the presence of a global leader board. A story mode could do a game with these mechanics good, in addition to what is essentially the challenge mode that the game is. It is what it is and doesn\u2019t try to be anything more or less.\n\nThere is not much to say about Devil Daggers due to its simplicity. Simplicity however, is both its greatest strength and weakness. The entirety of the game\u2019s content proves to be challenging and extremely fun to play. Unfortunately, the lack of content holds the game back from achieving its true potential. It is not revolutionary, but that\u2019s just fine for a game built on the nostalgia from when it was. Devil Daggers is downright fun and I recommend it to everyone with a tolerance for repetition, fans of shooters or not. This game might just surprise you.\n\n8/10", "timestamp_created": 1462842639, "timestamp_updated": 1462842639, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.588588", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22886776": {"recommendationid": "22886776", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006390900", "num_games_owned": 235, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1778, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1465410357}, "language": "french", "review": "Fast fps old schol compl\u00e8tement addictif  , du pure scoring dans une ambiance d\u00e9shumanis\u00e9e et un gameplay tellement simple et exigeant...

You can even do a famous Quake-like rocket jump if you want. \n\nBut be warned, there's nothing complex here in Devil Daggers.

You have two attacks: a constant stream and a shotgun burst that can be upgraded upon picking up red gems. Simple enough premise, but the execution is where the game shines. The Quake-like controls are very quick to respond and work well with shotgun-attack jumping (a'la rocket boosting in a way) and movement akin to bunnyhopping. The game requires as much patience and management of enemies as it does technical skill to land the shots.\n\nI like the simple premise with tantalizing skill ceiling, and for $5 it's a price that seems quite justified.

If the concept of obtaining progression only after putting lots of time into dying repeatedly doesn't appeal to you, then simply don't buy it. \n\nFor everybody else, this game is an absolute masterpiece in high-intensity clusterfuckery. It's made to make you feel helpless, and the only thing that keeps you going is the excrutiating desire to prove those floating skulls wrong. \n\nGraphics are intentionally dated, and you can see the quality underneath all of the pixelation. It's meant to feel like you're playing an arcade cabinet, and it does so very successfully. As a result, I'm inclined to give the look of the game a 10/10, as the art style appeals to me, and it fits the mood of the game. If all of the game's mechanics were placed into unreal engine on ultra settings, it simply wouldn't be the same game, and for that reason I appreciate the decision of the devs to use the charm of pixelated graphics.\n\nSound design is incredible. I have no words to describe the emotions the cacophony of sounds invokes in me. My first few attempts were filled with confusion, and the sound design is almost entirely to blame for that, which is a good thing. When the way a game sounds affects how well you can play, you know you're in for a treat. 10/10.\n\nGameplay is smooth, if only a little undefined. The perspective that's afforded to players makes you feel like you have presence on the stage, which is very much needed once the clock ticks past the 90 second mark for the first time. Knowing where you are on the stage comes very naturally, so I give it an A+ in that regard. Of course, the gameplay isn't without its issues, but the issues I take with it are very subjective and personal to me. I suggest playing the game to get a clear view on how it feels under your mouse and keyboard. 8.5/10\n\nConclusion: The game probably won't piss you off until you've died for the 50th time, and even then you will realize it was completely your fault, and not the games. Only until you reach world record status, which an extremely select few have, will you see a very clear line drawn in terms of fairness. \n\nThis game isn't just for people who enjoy the FPS genre, as it's a lot more than that. The omission of a targetting reticle makes the experience a lot more smooth, and the learning curve is steep. Because of this, I'd honestly recommend Devil Daggers the type of gamer that enjoys something like Dark Souls, where punishment is constant but player-perserverance is rewarded greatly.\n\nWith the three aspects of the game I scored, my average comes out to a 9.5, but keep in mind that this game isn't for everyone. Even though I've got a short amount of time played, I'm in the top five thousand globally with a current survival time of 179 seconds. Not everyone is going to catch on in less than two hours. And even though I've achieved this time, I'm still compelled to get even better, eventually obtaining that 0.1% achievement to showcase on my profile until the end of time. Because believe me, that achievement is going to STAY at 0.1% with how hard it is to get.\n", "timestamp_created": 1459273762, "timestamp_updated": 1459273762, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504604", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22127538": {"recommendationid": "22127538", "author": {"steamid": "76561197966501038", "num_games_owned": 188, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 236, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1459424122}, "language": "french", "review": "i don't know why, but yes.

Shooting moving skulls is satisfying.  \n\n- The gameplay area takes place on a relatively small platform.  As a result, the game is not allowed to increase the enemy count as much as it could.   \n\n- The dodging is overly simplistic.  For the most part, you are dodging variations of homing \"projectiles\".   The core dodging gameplay is just not very satisfying.  (For a good example of FPS dodging, check out Ziggurat, which combines many projectiles of different types the way that a SHMUP does, and Doom.)\nThe uninteresting dodging is the primary reason why I am not inspired to try and master Devil Daggers.\n\n- The game presents a lot of motionless targets (Pillars, spiders) which are not fun to kill.\n\n- The early stage becomes a drag once you have memorized the spawns.

The game is very simple and thus very easy understand - but mastering the game  takes alot of skill.\n\nThe game takes place in a hellish arena (very quake-esque) that spawns hordes of demons at you (in a pattern that is very slightly randomized) and your task is to kill anything that moves. The challenge of the game is to survive the demon horde as long as possible. This is easier said than done since you die from one hit (herein lie the rogue-lite elements). The game is very fast paced and very fun movement-wise - you can for instance perform something called a \"dagger jump\", which basically is a rocket jump, and it does seem like you gain some momentum by continously jumping (not sure though). \n   The music in the game is great (only plays in the menu). It brings back memories of Alone in The Dark and the old Resident Evil games. The sound design in general is actually very good. Everything really does sound hellish. The demons sound scary, the weapon sounds terrifying, the big spider skull enemy actually makes me uneasy. Different demons emit different sounds which makes it easier to telegrapgh where they are relative to your own position.\n\nThere are some issues woth the game though. The sound design is, as I just said, very good. Butt some sound effects blend in a little too much. There is a mechanic in the game where you have to collect red gems in order to upgrade your weapon. The game does not present how many gems you have collected (you need 10 for the first upgrade) and you have to count them yourself by listening to the little thump-like sound when they are picked up. However this sound effect is far from clear and it blends in with the background noise a little too easily.\n   Secondly the game lacks a proper options menu. The game would really benefit from some visual settings. Furthermore the games performance is rather iffy at times. I have an i5 4690k and an R9 280x and for some reason the game slows down a lot at times and at other times the game runs super smooth. It might very well be an isolated case.\n   Lastly the game only features one weapon (I'm not even sure what to call it). The weapon is upgradable, sure, but the upgrades don't really change all that much and it can get a little boring using the same gun over and over again. \n\nI do recommend this game because I feel that I got my money worth and for 5 dollars you could do a hell of a lot worse.", "timestamp_created": 1459167356, "timestamp_updated": 1459167544, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22102617": {"recommendationid": "22102617", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086947530", "num_games_owned": 132, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 296, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489378637}, "language": "english", "review": "A simulator where you play as a man who is starting to feel the effects of PCP laced LSD before walking into a Day of the Dead festival.", "timestamp_created": 1459164052, "timestamp_updated": 1489496788, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22101453": {"recommendationid": "22101453", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020744880", "num_games_owned": 200, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 671, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509715809}, "language": "english", "review": "Broke my fucking space bar playing this gnarly game", "timestamp_created": 1459158774, "timestamp_updated": 1459158774, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22101383": {"recommendationid": "22101383", "author": {"steamid": "76561198144309524", "num_games_owned": 217, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 1948, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502757831}, "language": "english", "review": "Did I ever tell you the definition of Insanity?", "timestamp_created": 1459158514, "timestamp_updated": 1459158514, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 26, "votes_funny": 26, "weighted_vote_score": "0.634749", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22097747": {"recommendationid": "22097747", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999711140", "num_games_owned": 434, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 611, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1459521545}, "language": "english", "review": "Quake meets Super Hexagon.

But don't worry if you can't get past an enemy, you can simply watch a playthrough of someone with a higher score than you on the leaderboard for guidance, which I find a very nifty feature.\n\nAll in all, this game is a 10/10 for me, and if you're a fan of FPSs, it should be for you as well.", "timestamp_created": 1458829575, "timestamp_updated": 1458829575, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22022999": {"recommendationid": "22022999", "author": {"steamid": "76561197981786643", "num_games_owned": 192, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 16334, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 23, "last_played": 1514041200}, "language": "english", "review": "Simple but highly addictive!", "timestamp_created": 1458828210, "timestamp_updated": 1458828210, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22021676": {"recommendationid": "22021676", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119681989", "num_games_owned": 184, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 19, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1460504801}, "language": "french", "review": "Meilleur FPS de l'ann\u00e9e 2016", "timestamp_created": 1458822819, "timestamp_updated": 1458822819, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499574", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22017426": {"recommendationid": "22017426", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031530139", "num_games_owned": 1089, "num_reviews": 66, "playtime_forever": 474, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1458506868}, "language": "english", "review": "While it's lacking in content, the mechanics are poilished to a mirror shine.

If you're not careful, frustration can set in, and perhaps a sense that you're just not good enough. But this game... this game! It teaches you its mastery without saying a word, all it asks is that you try, try and try again. Before you know it, you start to learn, to pick up patterns, try new strategies. It doesn't always work. In fact, it usually doesn't work. Games can be over in seconds, but hit \"R\" and you're immediately reset for another fateful attempt. Come back the next day and suddenly realise that your brain has subtly rewired itself and you're just a little bit better at it. Can't get past 60 seconds? Keep at it, before long you'll be disappointed in yourself if you don't get to 60 seconds each time.\n\nThis game is beautiful in the way it rewards you, the first time you kill a skull spider you'll want to punch the air, the first time you level up your weapon you'll feel a sense of euphoria. It's like a drug, and highly addictive, and surprisingly despite the fact each game is over in seconds, or perhaps minutes as you get better, you'll find that half an hour has past before you know it.\n\nDevil Daggers is Robotron by way of Quake, HR Geiger's fever dream with audio by Lustmord.

[b]The graphics are perfect; the ambient sounds are terrifying yet [i]very[/i] informative to a veteran player.[/b]\n\n[i]This title does perfectly what indie games should do: it takes risks and keeps things simple, boiling everything down to a beautifully addictive mechanism to keep you coming back for more (and my god the price is too cheap).[/i]\n\nThe premise of [i]Devil Daggers[/i] is really simple. You have to survive as many seconds as possible on a small-ish round platform surrounded in darkness. You have two attacks - a 'stream' of daggers (acts like a whip of sorts), and a shotgun blast of daggers. Your 'success' or 'score' is measured in seconds, and will be measured up against the world of gamers (and your Steam friends). The succession or waves of monsters is static, but how you go about it can differ remarkedly. The game has several nuances that really add depth. [spoiler]You can 'dagger jump' if you figure out how. There apparently is another ledge on the outside for the first 80 seconds. Closer enemies are a different color, and so on. [/spoiler]\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n+The dark atmosphere was masterfully crafted and gives quite an experience that keeps luring me back in.\n+The lack of music proper, with just ambient sounds is crazy scary and gives a fantastic experience.\n+The controls are spot-on.\n+It is utterly addicting! I didn't quite get it from watching videos - they all seem so repetitive - you have to try this for yourself!\n+The price-tag is a shame. This deserves more.\n+The global leaderboards are awesome. Oh man I'm coming for that #1 spot among my friends!\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n-This is such a perfect 'base' for a larger game. I'm thinking some crazy shooter in the vein of [i]Doom[/i] or [i]Hexen[/i]. This would make a great mini-game or mode for that larger game. Who knows, I've seen the developer comment about future content.\n-After the initial excitement and beating your record fairly often, you have to be self-driven to really get better and grind it out. Therefore, mileage will vary by person. Its still worth five bucks in my book, regardless.\n-There are no video options, and I've had issues getting it to work on both  my computers. With that in mind, the developer actually released a patch within 24 hours of my post that helped out (now I'm having trouble on the original computer that worked - but thats a whole other story).\n\n[b]One of the most addicting and well built games I have played in a while.[/b] If you are on the fence - just get it because you can get [i]a heck of alot[/i] of playtime in with 2 hours (remember surviving 60 seconds is a chore!), saving you the chance to refund.", "timestamp_created": 1458229247, "timestamp_updated": 1458314972, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517841", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21884714": {"recommendationid": "21884714", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013481396", "num_games_owned": 154, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 895, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482537038}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is fantastic.

I thought I was going to get bored of it so quickly with the lack of content. However the lack of content strangely ends up being the games strongest selling point.\n\nDevil daggers is an arena based survival game of ridiculously hard proportions. Only one arena is present in the game and no variations of it exist. For most games this would earn it an immediate not recommended status in my review. But devil daggers is made to perfection in a way to get you always wanting more and to never give up on trying to beat your highscore. It has a huge amount of replayability despite what initially might seem like a flaw in the design.  \n\nIt features some of the most satisfying combat I have seen in a video game to date. You are only presented with one weapon and no option to change. Despite the games title suggests your weapon is most definitely not a dagger. Your weapon is instead a gun that has 2 shooting abilities. The first option is a rapid fire mode that fires a barrage of bullets ahead of you. The second option is a shotgun like mode that fires a spray of bullets around the immediate area. This variation of fire modes is very useful when trying to avoid enemies and will help you get out of the worst situations. \n\nThe enemies in devil daggers is what makes it particularly difficult. Many are flying enemies that ruthessly follow you. This requires you to use expert tactics to avoid certain enemies while also shooting at others. Most enemies become faster than you as well meaning running away without killing is not an option. There is a great enemy variety in the game meaning each presents a different challenge to kill. The weak spots on each enemy are always obvious though being usually presented in a bright glowing light. The further you survive in the game the harder the enemies get. \n\nRuthlessly hard difficulty is what makes devil daggers particularly addicting. You will struggle to survive even 60 seconds in the arena. One hit from any enemy and you are immediately dead and you have to start again. The exact spawning locations of the enemies changes each game you play but the timing of when each enemy spawns is approximately constant thoughout each playthrough. So it is possible to learn certain patterns to help you in future playthroughs. \n\nThe games leaderboard system is what makes you want to keep playing and beat all your friends scores. Really the only score that exists is how long you manage to survive for which is given to a high precision of 4 decimal places. As of writing this review the highest scoring person survived for ~612 seconds. I have only survived a pitiful 60 seconds. The game features seperate world and friends leaderboards. So if you don't feel like your good enough to challenge the world then just challenge your own friends runs. Every leaderboard run is also saved so you can watch any run take place from start to finish. This is a fantastic extra feature to help you learn key survival techniques or just marvel at the skill of others.\n\nPixel art graphic styles are a personal favourite for me and I am always attracted to games featuring them when done well. Devil daggers is something of perfection in the art style. Bright colours, beautifully created unique looking characters and amazing animations really bring the game to life. Each enemy really has the devilish look that I expect. I honestly couldn't come up with a single complaint about the art style if I tried. \n\nSound design in devil daggers is also extremely good. Each enemy has it's own unique sound. All give off the signature devlish vibe that I expected. From squeels to screams or even the sound of spiders, the sound design is really perfect. The complaint I would have about sound though is the game has no music anywhere in it. I feel like music would make the game slightly more appealing for the long term. I mean it doesn't even have menu music which would be a very nice addition. \n\nOverall devil daggers is a small simple game that has a suprise amount of depth and replayability to it. It is one that I will definitely be coming back to often to try and beat mine and friends times. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of score attack or survival type games. The price of \u00a33.99 is a really reasonable price to ask for. \n\n[b]TheIronicGamers rating system[/b]\n[list][*] Don't ever buy this game. \n[*]Maybe consider it on a sale. \n[*]An average game.\n[*]A good game that should definitely be considered.\n[*][b][u]A must play![/u][/b]\n[/list]\n\n[quote][i]For more recommendations and reviews on our favourite up and coming quality games follow [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/LotsOGiveaways]Lot's O Giveaway's[/url] group curations [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/LotsOGiveaways#curation]here[/url]![/i][/quote]\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1458002953, "timestamp_updated": 1458002953, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.646781", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21843766": {"recommendationid": "21843766", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028095885", "num_games_owned": 547, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 214, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1461962792}, "language": "english", "review": "For what it's worth, it's a great game.

It has a familiar aesthetic to the original Quake and intentionally tries to resemble an old software renderer.\n\nHowever the game plays much more like a first person bullet hell where you dodge projectiles while continuously firing. There isn't really any overall objective beyond staying alive longer and eventually unlocking more projectiles. There is also very little additional content beyond additional monsters and projectile attacks.

I'm not going to defend the single flat arena, single game mode, and no \"story\" with the price argument, because you decide how much those features are worth to you. Excluding those features was a design choice as deliberate as the Quake-like graphics engine with it's blurry textures and polygon jitter, and the functional-yet-creepy sound design that lets you hear that seeker skull you lost track of a moment ago cackling in your ear before it closes in for the kill. Physics bugs like bunny hopping and rocket jumping exploited by top Quake players in the '90s make their encore here as carefully-tuned features triggered by responsive controls, balanced against the speed, turn radius, and attack patterns of a variety of flying skulls, tentacled monstrosities and skittering horrors in the dark. \n\nNone of this is ever explained.\n\nSo how do you learn how to play?

It\u2019s a very deceptive game however, as the simple objective of staying alive for as long as possible is marred by specific rules used by the enemies that in theory are simple to read and avoid, but when put into play together go from zero to frighteningly threatening in no time at all. Add to that a leaderboard that demands player perfection to reach the top, and you have a small game that fills a -big- niche.\n\nThe name of the game is survival, and with every passing second the game grows more and more invested in murdering the crap out of you. At first you\u2019ll simply get squid-like enemies that vomit a gaggle of minor skulls and a lone horned skull that tracks you much more intently when your back is turned, but before long the danger rockets up with enemies like ribbed-horned skulls that are -very- keen on biting your ankles and horrifying spiders that will produce offspring when they consume the valuable gems dropped by enemies, [just] to name a few of the obstacles the game will employ against you. Gems  dropped from specific enemies go towards powering up your dagger firing hand, and make no mistake, you -need- these upgrades if you want to survive beyond a minute. You at first have two methods of attack; a constant stream of daggers machine gun style or a shotgun blast that does great damage. The only issue is that the shotgun spray is random, which is a realistic representation, but having a run be ended by a minor skull because a stray round zips by its target grows incredibly frustrating after multiple attempts at a record run. With later upgrades your fire rate increases and you gain access to homing daggers that require constant charging through gem gathering - I know this not because I\u2019ve accessed it, but because I\u2019ve watched replays of others from the leaderboards who clearly have been playing old school shooters more than I have.\n\nSpeaking of, the replay system is a magnificent inclusion to the game, allowing you to download and watch runs from other players to see the how's and why's of leaderboard toppers, or compare your runs against friends via filters, allowing you to improve your game. Minus very brief hiccups in the playback from time to time, the replays are a verbatim recording of a player\u2019s run right up their demise - You don\u2019t \u2018win\u2019 Devil Daggers. You\u2019re going to bite the dust eventually, which is evident  from how chaotic replays from the latest or recent top times get. Thanks to the study of replays and chatter on forums, subtleties like bunny-hopping and rocket-jumping have been picked up along with other nuances; always keep moving, let off on firing to gather gems quickly, prioritize certain targets, and so on. Knowing the tricks to Devil Daggers is one thing, pulling them off is something else entirely. Thankfully death can be -very- brief, as a tap of the R key at any time will reset the game into a new, fresh run for you to attempt. \n\nYou won\u2019t be playing this game to relax and unwind thanks to the frightening enemy design and the deliciously disturbing sound design. The way the spiders flail and the crackling of their spindly limbs echoes nearby, pursuing skulls pant like horrid dogs when they\u2019re an inch away from robbing your run. When the later minutes start rolling on not only are the constant waves of enemies overwhelming but the sounds that are going on are oppressive on the eardrums. I actually have to turn down my volume while playing, otherwise I begin to sweat and feel more stress than one should, never mind when I get to later times where my limbs begin to tighten and my heart rate leaps up. I can\u2019t quite put my finger on why, but the Quake-style graphics only add that bit more to the appeal. While other games use pixel or \u2018retro\u2019 style graphics to cut graphical costs and merit visual appeal, Devil Daggers looks, feels and plays like it came right out of a time capsule as some sort of unreleased game, save for the modern leaderboards and replays.\n\nSave for the at times hair-pulling unreliability of the shotgun, there really isn\u2019t much extra that Devil Daggers could use, other than perhaps a practice mode to allow experimentation or careful studying of enemy movement without having to get killed and restart each time.

(Read the Gameplay Features section on its Steam page to get an idea of some of the core abilities available to you).\n- There is enough RNG in the game to keep it from getting stale, but not so much that it distorts the rankings on the leaderboards. As a result, people's records feel fair.\n- You can view in-game replays of other player's records. This will spoil whole sections of the game, but does demonstrate that these 600 second runs are in fact completely achievable.\n\nThe art and sound design is unique enough to give the game its own charms.

The clacking, wailing, screeching horrors of this game sort of trigger something deep in the recesses of my lizard brain. I guess it seems to me sort of like a game from a pearl-clutching anti-gaming TV movie. Like what Joe Leiberman or Hillary Clinton thought all games were. It has such a dark, foreboding, violent quality to it and it's so addictive that it's like what normies used to think gamers played all the time, back when being a 'gamer' was something to be ridiculed and not hip and trendy. People often compare it to Quake, which I suppose isn't entirely unfair, although Quake never gave me anywhere near the adrenaline rush Devil Daggers does. The fact that I only bought it a few days ago and I've already spent almost three hours playing a game in which I have yet to last longer than two minutes in a single session certainly illustrates something about the grip it's got on me.\n\nBeyond all that, it's ridiculously well-designed in pretty much every way. 'Retro' is a big thing in gaming recently, and I usually hate it, but I've never seen anyone do it precisely this way. It's interesting that the PSX is probably the biggest reference point for me in terms of the software-rendered visual style this game revels in, since at the time the PSX was big I didn't have one. I only bought one near the end of its life cycle. During the heyday of the PSX, I was gaming on a high-end PC with a 3D accelerator, and sneering at all my friends who only had consoles. Had this been an exclusive, as so often happened in those days, this would have been one of the ones that would slap that sneer off my face. This game wears its visual style well, and it's perfectly suited to the dull color palette of the game and its various nightmarish creatures. \n\nThe sound, as noted by many, is a thing of glory. It reminds me of games even older than the controversial games of my childhood, games I never got to see in an arcade, like Battlezone or Missile Command or Tempest with their thumps and drones and throbs. Tempest can probably even be viewed as a distant ancestor of this game in more than a few ways. I can just imagine Devil Daggers' nightmarish cracklings, grindings, and wails seething through mall arcades somewhere in the depths of the mid-90s. If someone ever cared to port this to a cabinet, it would be more than worth it.\n\nLike the best arcade games, the gameplay itself is ridiculously simple to pick up and horrifically complex to even be competent at, much less master. The weapon you wield is powerful, but if you stop moving or lose focus for even a second, it can mean death. There are so many different intermixing strategies for dealing with the various monsters that have to be balanced and combined at all times to have any chance of success, you have to empty your mind before the onslaught begins. And I wish I hadn't accidentally read about the jewel power-ups, because I feel like I unintentionally cheated. Figuring out how that worked on my own would have caused me to get wrecked even more often than I did when initially starting, and I would have enjoyed coming to the conclusion organically. \n\nI guess one of my only complaints about this game, and don't interpret this as a refusal to git gud, because I'm certainly working on it, is that echolocation, the ability to gauge the positions of things based on sound, plays a massive role in staying alive from moment to moment even beyond figuring out and managing the interlocking strategies required to deal with the different monsters. Not a huge problem, except that not everyone is equal in terms of the ability to echolocate, so some sort of map or at least proximity indicator apart from just sound or the monsters turning orange wouldn't have been a terrible option.\n\nTL;DR it's great. If you like arcade games or are nostalgic for the kind of graphics on display or just the kind of guy or girl who wants to beat everyone's time and show us all how inferior we are, buy it. As someone mentioned in the discussion, if you played it in an arcade, your money would be gone in five minutes and you'd still walk out pumped up, covered in sweat, squinting at the light of the outside world, and smiling ear to ear. You may not do that irl ever again, if you live in Murrica at least, but this can get you somewhere close to that sublime euphoria.", "timestamp_created": 1457489941, "timestamp_updated": 1457489941, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.330364", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21719946": {"recommendationid": "21719946", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053856594", "num_games_owned": 210, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 2294, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496687064}, "language": "english", "review": "Came for the art style, stayed for the gameplay.\nThe gameplay is so extremely tight and solid that I can't do anything but say it's great.\nEverytime you die, hit \"R\" and get straight back into the action.\n\nBut I mean really, it's $5.

It's realizing there is nowhere else for you to go, and giving up.\n\nDevil Daggers is a fight between you and some floating skulls in Hell. It looks like 1996-era Quake and it's meant to because that's how it wants to intimidate you. The soundscape of Devil Daggers involves skull noises, raspy laughter, high-pitched screaming, industrial humming, and spider tickling. Your job is to survive the hordes of skulls and to take their precious blood rubies - initially, they don't do anything, but if you grab ten of those things, you become a more powerful monster among the monsters, nuking skulls and creepy spider-skull monsters with greater ease. But just because you're a more powerful combatant doesn't mean it will get easier, because Devil Daggers will throw all sorts of shit at you, and it loves to make you squirm.\n\nYour first few playthroughs will last approximately around 60 seconds. In order to 'beat' the game (read: get the sole achievement that says 'Devil Daggers'), you will need to last 500 seconds, or approximately 8 minutes and 20 seconds. This is not a goal you are likely to accomplish unless you are very, very good at first person shooters. I consider myself well-learned in the genre and I made it half a second away from three minutes (which puts me roughly in the top 10% of all players who have submitted a score). At the time of this review, only seven people have beaten this game out of the 27,000 players that have tried to conquer it so far. That does not make it a bad game, that makes us all weak people who can't stand up in the face of naked, unfiltered terror, and those seven people are our champions.\n\nDevil Daggers is a game you're not likely to beat, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't count it out. After all, the narrative experience is not the only valid experience in video games.

Pick it up, and the opaque expanse turns reddish, and infernal whispers start to fill the air. Soon enough, tentacled turrets that look like relatives of Nyarlathotep sprout out of the ground at the edges of the arena, and spit screaming skeleton heads at you.

Once you're dead, you can check out the leaderboards and chew on your resentment while watching replays of demigods trouncing the Hellspawn for ten minutes straight, dodging and weaving their way out of a maelstorm of pixellated horrors that makes the first Quake's monster designs feel tame in comparison.\n\nThen, you're likely to hit \"Retry\", bolstered as you've been by the sight of DraQ laughing in the face of Hades' minions for what feels like an eternity.

Il est impossible de rester en vie en laissant les ennemies s'accumuler car le comportement des mobs est ultra agressif, ils vous rush tous et bien \u00e9videmment vous mourrez au moindre de leur contact.\n\nEn pratique \u00e7a demande une concentration et une organisation sans faille, car non seulement il faut \u00e9liminer les mobs qui rush (cr\u00e2nes volants, araign\u00e9e) mais aussi d\u00e9truire les mobs qui les font spawner encore et encore. Le rythme est fr\u00e9n\u00e9tique, vous n'avez aucun r\u00e9pit.\n\nVous n'avez qu'une vie, il n'y a pas de checkpoint et vous mourez \u00e0 la moindre collision avec un ennemie. Les mouvements sont rapides car il faut constament slalomer entre les mobs donc vous pouvez faire du bunny hopping, double jump, daggers jump. Bref il faut tryhard comme un porc, si vous survivez 120 secondes vous \u00eates un bon joueur.\n\nJe le recommande sans soucis personnellement. Le prix de 5\u20ac est plut\u00f4t correcte, je pr\u00e9cise que les options de bases comme l'asignement des touches et la sensibilit\u00e9 de la souris sont pr\u00e9sentes.", "timestamp_created": 1457024985, "timestamp_updated": 1457024985, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499574", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21604755": {"recommendationid": "21604755", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970737065", "num_games_owned": 2250, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 142, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482967104}, "language": "english", "review": "Sheer balls-to-the-wall excitement and intensity. \n\nThere may not be many enemy types, but who cares when your palms are sweating and your dodging left and right in your seat, trying frantically to survive another second?", "timestamp_created": 1457022192, "timestamp_updated": 1457022192, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21604682": {"recommendationid": "21604682", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045234840", "num_games_owned": 360, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 431, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499348404}, "language": "english", "review": "F**KING INTENSE", "timestamp_created": 1457021922, "timestamp_updated": 1459340507, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499835", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21604238": {"recommendationid": "21604238", "author": {"steamid": "76561197977082122", "num_games_owned": 113, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 301, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480524961}, "language": "english", "review": "More playtime from a \u00a34 single room game than most AAA titles...

I can still feel my pulse in my fingertips, though, reminding me of my last sudden fatality by laughing skull. It's the most recent death of many, sometimes brought on by nerves, sometimes by hesitation, and sometimes by arrogance. There aren't many ways to die in the game, but a lot of reasons why, enough to keep the cycle of death and more death fresh for hours.\n\nDevil Daggers is an arena FPS pitting you and your titular daggers against a yawning void of bloodthirsty skulls. Every attempt sees your enemies spawning in waves, a host of flying skulls, laughing skulls, spider skulls, serpent skulls, and worse. Your only defenses are your Quake-like reflexes and your daggers, fired in either a chaotic stream or a shotgun-like blast. Both attacks see a lot of use in culling the horde, either hosing down dense groups or sniping troublesome skulls.\n\nLarger enemies drop gems that can upgrade your attacks, but you can only attract them when you're not shooting. Furthermore, there are enemies that will happily hoover up your gems, delaying your vital upgrades. It's a small detail but one that adds a significant layer of strategy to the game. You'll die plenty trying to master it, though, as the end is only a single skull touch away. The learning curve is significant but there is one, because enemies always spawn in at the same times each round, just in different places.\n\nAll of this is wrapped in a deliciously chunky retro-3D package that evokes the best parts of early shooters. I know some people call the original Quake ugly but it had a grim, nightmarish quality to its software polygons that Devil Daggers makes the most of. The sound design deserves special mention as well, hitting you with dark rumblings, menacing synth, and quad-damage-style stingers in the heat of battle. Each of your foes has their own cues, from the coconut-like clatter of basic skulls to the spiderleg-tapping of enormous skittering horrors. The persistent audio assault coupled with the dark, pixel-blurred creatures lunging at you from all angles makes every round a little panic attack of demonic portend.\n\nThere are global and friend leaderboards to compare scores on, so you'll get the most out of the game if you have folks to chase after. The only criticism I can really level against Devil Daggers is that that's it. There's no story, no multiplayer, no other modes or permutations other than that one harrowing arena. Hopefully you understand at this point that the combat, enemy, and aesthetic designs make this more than worth your time, because you'll find few rushes in the gaming world like Devil Daggers.\n\n\n\nDid you enjoy this review?

All around you are flying skulls, spider skulls, worm skulls, and more skulls. Destroy them in an effort to last as long as possible - high scores are measured in seconds (to four decimal places), and nothing else.\n\nAnd it's [b]hard[/b]. Like, really damn [i][b]hard[/b][/i]. When you start out, you probably won't last much longer than 50 seconds for the first few plays as you learn the behaviors of the monsters, as well as the Do's and Don'ts of maneuvering in such a claustrophobic slice of Hell. It is a testament to this game's design, however, that with repeated play you will get noticeably better. There's more skill than luck involved in good play, and you'll start to wonder how you could ever manage the indignity of a 50-second time again as you start climbing to the 100, 200, 300 second marks and beyond. There is a method to the madness this game throws at you, one spooky wave after another, and it will pummel the method right into you.\n\nAesthetically, this game is [i]on point.[/i] The art direction is a deliberate nod to [i]Quake[/i] more than anything - I believe the developers said they were going for the feel of a \"'90s shooter fever dream.\" Sounds about right.\nThe deliberately low-res graphics are brown and black and red all over (not a criticism - it fits right in), and the monster designs are as creepy as they are well-rendered.\nThe sounds are of an auditory palette that is altogether eerie, otherworldly, and unsettling.\nEven the menu music is the sort of industrial nightmare that Trent Reznor could've whipped up.\n\nThe action itself is fluid, jank-free and suited to the pace this game expects of you. In further nods to [i]Quake[/i] and its brood, there's bunny-hopping and \"rocket\"-jumping (firing the dagger blast into the ground) to get around, though I've only found limited use for the latter. Top replays I've watched seem to reinforce this, unless I'm not watching closely enough.\n\nIf I have one knock against the game, it's that around the 500 second mark the game shifts into a sort of Thermonuclear Player-Must-Die mode which renders any times past that point more of a matter of luck than skill. Granted, the whole \"goal\" of the game seems to be to last that long - 500+ second runs are highlighted in red on the leaderboards, and it's the requirement of the game's sole achievement, \"Devil Dagger.\" I suppose that's just me wishing this could go on forever, or that the skill ceiling could be set even higher now that there's 5 players (as of March 1, 2016) who've surpassed the 500 mark, with two of them within just 15 seconds of 600 - I want to see just how far they can reach within this platform without it getting [i]too[/i] unfair.\nHowever, for $5, reaching the \"goal\" will give you a [u]lot[/u] of bang for your buck.\n\nIf you like arcadey twitch-action shooters, [i][b]Devil Daggers[/b][/i] is probably the best bargain buy you can get on Steam.

Twitch reflexes help but are not essential to playing well. You play on a square grid and encounter mobs comprised of increasingly resilient and speedy enemies. Early game, all mobs spawn from swarm towers that can be destroyed. Later in the game, mobs enter from outside of the area of combat and have vulnerable spots that must be hit in order to earn kills. As you kill stronger mobs, you can harvest red gems that increase the area of effect and power of your fire, and (at certain breakpoints) massively upgrade your damage output.\n\nThe controls are very minimalistic: you can assign four keys to directional movement, one key to jump, one key to your primary fire (hold for stream shot, tap for shotgun), and one key to homing fire (available later in the game). You can perform several special maneuvers including a knife jump (shotgun the ground and jump simultaneously), bunny hop (tap jump again as soon as you land, catapaulting forward), and double jump (still don't know how to do this, or why you ever would).\n\nThe game's graphics are intentionally minimal, designed to ensure that all but the oldest computer setups can run the game at 60fps. This is essential, because any framerate lag would lead to a substantially less enjoyable game. There are only four colors to speak of: black for the environment, orange for the player and player fire, red for gems, and brown for enemy structures.\n\nThe game's sound is incredible. Listening is essential to mastering the waves and thinking ahead. The sound of your fire is rather muted, which is wonderful, because you'll be firing a lot. Different enemies have different audio cues. From the frenetic snapping of swarm skulls, to the clicking of simple patrols, to the manic laughter of pursuers, to the clacking of spiders, to the ominous rumbling of centipedes, each sound is distinct and can layer over the others.\n\nThe only score that matters is seconds: how long did you survive until you were overwhelmed? That is the value that ranks players, and the designers of the game have made it possible for you to review any player's run from the leaderboard. It adds to the experience to be able to watch a top 10 player cruise through content that still overwhelms me.\n\nI have a score in the top 5% of all players, and I am damn proud of it. The game has incredible replay value so far. Each additional second of survival feels like a triumph, and I find the difficulty curve to be immensely rewarding. Mob mechanics that demanded my total attention earlier feel manageable now, while new mobs and new scenarios increasingly challenge my skills and force me to improve or quit.\n\nI haven't quit yet, and don't plan too soon. As of the time that I write this review, my best run ended at 199 seconds and some change. I will feel really satisfied to break 200, and hope to continue scratching my way up the leaderboard. \n\nI believe you will get more than five dollars worth of value from this game. I look forward to seeing future content from the developers. I would love to see addon packs that could change the textures in-game, and would happily pay for the privilege to change the color schemes and enemy models.\n\nUPDATE: Immediately after finishing this review, I smashed my old record and hit 250 seconds.

Enemies are pretty self explanitory, nothing too complicated. \n\nfor its price, its a solid purchase, but it can doesnt have much replayability at the moment i am typing this\n\nthe game has potential, give it a few content updates, maybe an easy mode for the players who arent as skilled, and maybe some map variety \n\nit has atmosphere, a good sense of hopelessness, i would complain about the lack of music, but i feel like it adds to it, having music would take you out of it in my opinion\n\nconclusion\nfor its price you cant go wrong, it has atmosphere and gets slightly easier as you go, definitely a game to play before you go to bed, so you can hear those demon screaches in your dreams\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1456644144, "timestamp_updated": 1456644144, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21516554": {"recommendationid": "21516554", "author": {"steamid": "76561197977197943", "num_games_owned": 241, "num_reviews": 60, "playtime_forever": 32, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504654441}, "language": "english", "review": "drive me crazy everytime, but i can't stop playing it.\n", "timestamp_created": 1456638532, "timestamp_updated": 1456638532, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.472441", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21515601": {"recommendationid": "21515601", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992053719", "num_games_owned": 772, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 359, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491688771}, "language": "english", "review": "Everything about Devil Daggers feels and sounds great.

It is an arcade, high-score attack shooter where you're perched on a hellish platform, using a machinegun/shotgun hybrid against massive hordes of demons.\nThis game is unique, in the sense that it is amazing because of its simplicity.  What you see in the trailer is effectively the only stuff in the game.  If you are a content junkie, then maybe give this game a pass.\nHowever, what you see here is a PERFECT example of quality over quantity.  The developers, rather than cramming extra features in, took a teeny golden nugget, concentrated and crammed all the greatness they could, and released a tiny, but shining gem.  It doesn't do much, but what this game does do, is effectively perfection.\nWhat exactly makes this game so great anyway?  \nThis game is so satisfying, so intense, so crunchy that it is hard to ever get tired of it.  Additionally, the atmosphere is absolutely amazing.  Get chills down your spine as you see flocks of demons and devils swarming towards you, as you hear their heavy breathing getting louder and louder.\nThe difficulty here is beautiful.  Beads of sweat will dot your face as you frantically jump about and slaughter everything facing you.  You will close the game panting and thinking \"h-h-oly...\"  chug an energy drink and play this, and the power you'll feel is insane.  \nSomething you hear too many games boast about is \"fast paced classic fps action!! Just like doom and quake!! THROWBACK!!!\"  And then they were lying, as the game reaks of modern slow-paced boredom.  But no-this game is a TRUE testament to the original days of quake.  It is strongly reminiscent.\nOverall, as long as you're fine with minimal content, this is a game that energy-junkies and gothic theme-enjoyers will absolutely adore.

Si je devais le mettre dans une cat\u00e9gorie, il irait rejoindre les [i]fps[/i] avec une l\u00e9g\u00e8re composante [i]roguelike[/i]. On s'y retrouve en effet projet\u00e9 sur une plateforme dont il ne faut absolument pas tomber tout en \u00e9vitant une horde de d\u00e9mons flottants semblant venir tout droit d'un cauchemard de Clive Barker et de Doom.\n\nLe concept est donc on ne peut plus simple, ne s\u2019embarrassant pas d'\u00eatre trop complexe dans un premier temps. Car en v\u00e9rit\u00e9, c'est un jeu tr\u00e8s difficile, notre objectif \u00e9tant de rester le plus longtemps possible en vie, sachant que se faire toucher une seule fois \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 notre d\u00e9c\u00e8s sans autre forme de proc\u00e9s. Il devient \u00e0 terme de plus en plus difficile de rester en vie, car le nombre d'ennemis augmente sans cesse si d'aventure nous n'\u00e9tions pas suffisamment v\u00e9loce et rapide pour d\u00e9truire ces engences d\u00e9moniaques.\n\nEn bref, c'est le genre de jeu qui nous pousse \u00e0 nous surpasser, qui nous donne envie de toujours aller plus loin et de faire toujours mieux. Il est fortement possible de n'y jouer que quelques minutes, voire secondes \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu'il est d\u00e9j\u00e0 tr\u00e8s difficile de d\u00e9passer la minute de survie. Cependant, il devient aussi tr\u00e8s vite addictif. On en revient souvent \u00e0 se dire [i]\"Allez, une derni\u00e8re partie\"[/i] pour la \u00e9ni\u00e8me fois, alors que les heures d\u00e9filent.\n\nCependant, si on accroche tant \u00e0 ce jeu, c'est que derri\u00e8re l'apparente simplicit\u00e9 de son [i]gameplay[/i] se cache plusieurs bonnes id\u00e9es qui en font \u00e0 mon avis un des meilleurs dans sa cat\u00e9gorie comme on n'en a pas vu depuis bien longtemps. De par sa simplicit\u00e9 et son imm\u00e9diatet\u00e9; j'ai le sentiment d'y retrouver des sensations proches du sus-nomm\u00e9 Doom ou encore de Quake. \n\nOn n'y dispose que d'une arme, les fameuses dagues d\u00e9moniaques, que l'on peut tirer sans fin, et surtout sans avoir \u00e0 recharger. Les temps morts ne sont pas pour Devil Daggers. Mais l\u00e0 o\u00f9 il se diff\u00e9rencie le plus, c'est de par son utilisation extr\u00eamement pouss\u00e9 du son. Tendre l'oreille y devient capital, puisque c'est par les sons que les ennemis produisent que l'on arrivera \u00e0 les rep\u00e9rer le plus facilement. \n\nPar exemple, il existe un cr\u00e2ne volant dot\u00e9 de cornes. Ce dernier se contente dans un premier temps de flotter \u00e7a et l\u00e0 sans nous ennuyer. Sauf qu'au bout d'un moment, cette cr\u00e9ature va se mettre \u00e0 notre poursuite. C'est \u00e0 ce moment pr\u00e9cis qu'elle sera facilement reconnaissable par le bruit caract\u00e9ristique qu'elle produira en nous poursuivant. \n\nIl est donc conseill\u00e9 d'y jouer avec un casque pour s'y habituer le plus vite possible, et ainsi les rep\u00e9rer plus facilement pour mieux savoir quand se retourner.

Especially if you're not too good at FPS games, you will get either frustrated with this game or you will break your wrists trying to survive longer and longer. DD is a hell simulator. No one will hold your hand in hell and neither in DD. \n\nWith persistence and patience you'll learn how to kill the skulls more efficiently or focus on enemies that are harder to dodge. You'll learn how to use the more advanced movement techniques to your advantage and survive past the few waves. By this time, if you're like me, you're hooked.\n\nPlaying Devil Daggers is one of the fastest ways to train your (virtual) spatial awareness, reaction time and accuracy. If you suffer from \"ingame laziness\" or you often pray to RNG gods to be in your favor, you'll quickly get rid of those habits. I play DD in short amounts, that's why I don't have too many hours in it yet or a good score (probably 95 seconds). I wouldn't call DD a time waster, more like an energy booster or brain resetter. I probably couldn't even play DD an hour straight, but I still enjoy it a lot when I play.\n\nRight now, DD is very minimalistic and doesn't have much content in it. It is not easily moddable nor does it have a level editor, but with enough support and interest the game might be updated with either tool officially. There's no timeline when this happens though (not that I know of). The game is already really solid and the graphics look awesome, but I can't help it if I want more eventually. I am not alone with this opinion either and I hope DD will some day support modding and community made levels.\n\nGet it. It's only $5.

Every element serves a purpose. From the scraping dry laughter to the red glint of gems. Devil Daggers is lo-fi poetry in motion. \n\nThe eponymous weapon combines doom 2's double barrel shotgun and Hyperblaster into a single devstating instrument of death. The movement system is straight out of Doom, Quake and Painkiller. Strafe running, strafe jumping, bunny hopping, it's all there. But don't let that speed go to your head. While you can accelerate faster, the enemy has higher top speeds. But their swarms cannot turn as fast. The demonic swarm also has exploitable behaviors, notably they will try to avoid your daggers. This allows you to carve paths of destruction, splitting the demonic hordes as you punch through. With sharp target prioritization, skillful shooting and the grace of a satanic, bullfighting ballerina you can eke out extra seconds of life as you climb the leaderboards. And speaking of the leaderboards, they have a wonderful demo feature. Every scoring run is recorded. Probably the best anti-cheat feature possible for a leaderboard, as well as a wealth of information and techniques.\n\nSure to fall flat with the cinematic shooter crowd, this is a love letter to ID's glory days, right down to the gritty textures of the low poly models and the palettes that color them. There is no story to tell or goal to achieve except the tale of your own mastery. A total emphasis on skill, no margin for error and absolutely zero downtime (even death holds no loading screens) is this game's hallmark. Devil Daggers demands nothing less than your total attention, and while razor sharp reflexes will serve you well, you need to have an even sharper grasp of position and target priority. Hell has many lessons to teach. It communicates so well there is no need for a HUD. All the information you require is in the motion of your enemy, the sound of bone scraping on stone, your own momentum as you strafe the edges of this platform suspended in the void. \n\nDevil Daggers is a purposeful distillation of what made the greats so compelling.", "timestamp_created": 1456190864, "timestamp_updated": 1456190864, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 220, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.900253", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21396884": {"recommendationid": "21396884", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067863481", "num_games_owned": 235, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 43, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1456277477}, "language": "english", "review": "this game made me want to cry", "timestamp_created": 1456190114, "timestamp_updated": 1456190114, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21396611": {"recommendationid": "21396611", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997118766", "num_games_owned": 1005, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 29, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1456202669}, "language": "english", "review": "This game fucked me up.\nIn all seriousness, this game is pretty damn creepy.

You're thrown into a small arena where you will face off against an ever-increasing endless barrage of Hellspawn creatures and need to survive for as long as you can. The only scoring metric is time and you're fighting for top placement on the leaderboards. Sessions are usually very quick (most people will be lucky to survive a minute) and things start hard and only get harder fast. You have unlimited ammo and can fire either a continuous barrage or if you tap your mouse button, blasts similar to a shotgun. There are only a handful of upgrades available, some of which are obtained by collecting red gems the enemies drop and others that you just get automatically for surviving certain amounts of time. That's basically it.\n\nThe leaderboards also allow you to view anyone's run. This is a great feature that will not only keep people honest and point out cheaters but is also a great teaching tool, allowing you to glean strategies and ideas for how to improve your own runs. Devil Daggers is all about iterative progress so be prepared to die a lot and to need to play hundreds of times to get good.\n\nDevil Daggers runs on a custom engine and purposefully uses a graphical style similar to old DOS first person shooters like DOOM, Duke Nukem 3D and other Build Engine games. It won't be everyone's cup of tea but as a huge fan of those games, I thought it was a really cool throwback.\n\nThis game is cheap, dead simple to understand but brutally hard to master.

An elegantly designed arcade style arena FPS that not only is an example of a simple idea done well, but its posterchild. From the introductory screen onward, the bleak Gothic atmosphere takes hold, clearly worshiping at the altar of Quake, with stark colors and industrial edged background music. Starting the game, the goal is simple: navigate and combat a horde of demons as they spawn into the arena. The longer you survive, the higher your score, and the higher your place on the leaderboards. One hit however, and it's all over. The game is punishingly difficult, but not unfair. It provides you with a plethora of tools to deal with the onslaught. You have incredible fluidity of movement, that allows you to bunnyhop and dodge and weave your way through enemies. You have a single weapon, the daggers, which are actual projectiles (as opposed to hitscan) with two alternate fire modes, a spraying rapid fire which must be well timed and lead, and a shotgun like blast, that requires twitch accuracy for maximum effect. You can use that blast to catapult yourself into the air, a \"rocket jump\"-esque maneuver. These abilities not only skyrocket the skill ceiling, but the excellent pace of the game allows you to learn without becoming comfortable, pushing your ability constantly. Once in motion, this is where the visual and sound design shine brightest, both from a mechanical and artistic standpoint. Artistically, the game is one of the most cohesive and focused visions I've seen in games recently. The monster design is impeccable, managing to be both complicated and clear, grotesque and horrifying, and how everything is rendered evokes the days of the old school shooter. On top of that, the 3D sound allows for complete immersion, with each monster giving off it's own call until the arena is crescnedoed into an orchestra of foul clicks, jittering, and crys. Mechanically, these same things give the player all the information they need to move about the arena: monster silhouettes are easily distinguishable, and the host of audio cues not only tell you where the monsters are, but what kind of monster it is lurking outside your vision. But even with all that, the game will kill you. Thankfully it never steps into frustrating territory. The game allows to you instantly restart a run at any time, placing you back at the beginning in less than a second. This ease of access prevents frustration to set in between attempts, and greatly increases the draw of an already addictive formula. And to top it all off with a nice little bow, the leaderboards feature a replay system. Not only will you be able to watch back your own high score, to either show off, or to see how you did it, but anyone on the visible leaderboard will have a replay available of the run that put them there in the first place, enabling you to study those ahead of you simply by clicking an icon. It's a brilliant package, but understandably not for everyone. The steep difficulty paired with the admittedly low amount of content will be enough to put some off, and that is understandable, but at five dollars it's difficult to argue against its value.

As you progress through the waves, the enemies increase in number, but seem to be limited to around 10 total types of enemies (this is as much as I have seen through my playthrough and others playthroughs.)\n\nThere is also only ONE dimmly lit arena (that you can kill yourself by falling off the edge), that can leave you wishing it was just a little bigger.  If the game ends, I have not seen the ending yet (at the time of this review).  This unfortunately sets the game with a very small amount of content provided for its cost.\n\nI understand how this sort of thing can be a turn off to people.  As far as I am concerned, this game is simply addictive and amazing in the vein of a solid arcade title.  If the developers decided to add more to the game, it would be amazing, but I personally feel it is not nessesary to maintain a level of interest that will keep me coming back.\n\nGiven its price tag, I would advertise this game as an arcade gem, and well worth the investment.", "timestamp_created": 1456129251, "timestamp_updated": 1456129251, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503703", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21381444": {"recommendationid": "21381444", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993892849", "num_games_owned": 1075, "num_reviews": 52, "playtime_forever": 179, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512475238}, "language": "english", "review": "The closest thing I can compare this game to is a cross between Quake and Geometry Wars.

Absolutely blew me away. \n\nFirst of all, especially given the price point, YES, it's worth your investment. Think of this game as mixture of Unreal Tournament, Doom, Magic Carpet, and Geometry Wars. The intensity, addictive quality, and horror are all top-notch. Of particular note is the SOUND DESIGN and direction. I'm an extremely jaded survival horror fan, and it's tough to impress me with audio - or scare me with it, given that I'm a noise musician in my spare time - but the relentless, terrifying soundscape that this game includes grates on you and psychologically fatigues you in the best possible way. \n\nIt's truly a refreshing experience and a ton of fun. A brutal challenge but sooooo worth the money.\n\nNow, DEVS: If you're reading this, I think you have an amazing formula here and I hope you expand on it. I could see this functioning very well as a stand alone title. Part of what makes it so unique and cool is that it's not bloated with a million additional add-ons, and seems like a genuine labor of love. Another reviewer described it as a nearly perfect game, and I agree. HOWEVER, I'm concerned with the game's longevity. I would appreciate a few power-ups and/or additional weapons along the way. Maybe a minimalized system like Binding of Isaac's character selection, where you can eventually unlock some different abilities or something like that. I would totally respect you if you disagreed with that opinion - in fact, I would admire your commitment to your aesthetic! However, that might be the difference between me playing this game for 5 hours or for 50 hours.\n\n Ultimately, I'm glad this game exists. I very much hope you will entertain the possibility of making a sequel or some DLC to expand on the ideas you have. You have an incredibly solid foundation and I hope to see it grow. Then again, if it doesn't, I'll love it all the same. \n\nIn fact, I like the game so much I would be happy to volunteer to work on it. Not that you guys need the help, but if you're willing to point me in the direction of a way to mod the game, I'd be happy to prototype some features - I have some experience with game design and coding. I guess what I'm saying is... this game gets me excited about making and playing games!

It feels like Quake with more hellish legions. The sounds and visuals are stunning, the rounds are fast and brutal, and the controls are super tight.

Each round lasts about 60-90 seconds (for me) and they always get me pumped. I'm not really someone who's typically driven by competition, but the challenge this game presents is too tempting for me to turn down. It's an incredible bullet hell that's devilishly satisfying to play. \n\nOne of my favorite features is how you can download and watch replays from the people topping the leaderboards so you can learn some of the tactics they use to stay alive. And in a game like this where mechanical mastery and knowledge of the challenges you'll have to face are key to survival, that's an amazing feature. Even the top-scoring run is less than eight minutes long at the time of writing this - which means the game is incredibly challenging - but there's a lot of nuance in understanding the enemy design and movement, so having an opportunity to see the game from the perspective of someone who clearly has a level of mastery beyond your own is invaluable. \n\nThe game almost feels minimalist in design. There's one game mode, and the core of the gameplay is super simple to learn. But it's brilliant in execution. It's extremely satisfying. I'm addicted to trying to beat my friends' scores.

No tutorials, no boring ass cutscenes or dialogue to suffer through. This is a game where you have to learn everything yourself unless of course you look up directions.\n\nVisuals -\nA nice retro 90's shooter aesthetic made on a completely custom engine the devs built.\nEnemies are demonic and creepy with some really nice touches. The giant spider who sucks in gems is especially scary.\nThe level is nothing more than a flat piece of land with repeating textures with an abyss of blackness around it.\n\n7/10. Would be higher if the ground had a little more to it, but I appreciate it for what it is.\n\nAudio - \nEverything is a creepy crunchy, crackle and ambient sound. As you progress through the game and new enemies appear, they make different sounds. Each enemy makes a unique sound so you know what to be aware of. Your hand that shoots \"Devil Daggers\" at the start make a low hum but as you progress gets louder into a screeching almost screaming sound, like tortured souls of hell.\n\n10/10. I know that seems generous but it has been quite some time since a game has blown me away with the audio.\n\nGameplay -\nThe game is about as simple as it it gets. You spawn in and shoot enemies, however, you also have other objectives to be aware of. The floating pillars for example spawn the flying enemies who chase you down to kill you. If you do not kill the pillars they will keep spawning enemies over and over. The game is also set with a timer that always spawns set pieces of different enemies so if you don't take out the pillars they will keep spawning as the game progresses. Getting the red gems upgrades your Devil Dagger arm and those are absolutely crucial if you want to progress, so you have to always be collecting whilst killing. Each enemy moves differently and has different weak points so you have to be quick with you aiming and skillful as well. This game is VERY DIFFICULT.\n\n5/10. The gameplay is fantastic but suffers from a repetitive feel after so long, but when you pick it back up after a break it feels fresh again. The ranking leaderboards also keep you striving to get further. \n\nOVERALL - The game is a breath of fresh air do to its dark art style and excellent sound design. It takes your traditional horde type gameplay and adds in horror and desperation making you feel the adrenaline as you get firther along. Fun in short burts but lacks long term playing due to no level design. I'd recommend this game only to those who strive for leaderboards or a challenge, anyone who is looking to shoot and go through waves with relative ease or enjoy a more slow paced game should skip this.\n\nFINAL SCORE - 6/10.", "timestamp_created": 1456073294, "timestamp_updated": 1456073793, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21367501": {"recommendationid": "21367501", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041430874", "num_games_owned": 228, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 273, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496793081}, "language": "english", "review": "Devil Daggers is an extremely fast paced twitch shooter entirely focused on score attack.

The game itself just starts up with you standing in front of a dagger and once you pick it up you are immidiately attacked by an array of 3 types of enemies which only get more and more difficult as the timer goes on, it can be extremely difficult for some people to even pass the 60 second mark.\n\nOutside of that the game has no story, no secrets (unless you count figuring out how the game mechanics work) and nothing but the challenge of the game. In that respect it is a lot like super hexagon where the whole game is centered around beating your friends highscores and beating your own previous score. It should be said though, that the enemies do become predictable after some time and often you can tell immidiately when the new enemies are going to spawn so once you play the game a whole lot the beginning can become a bit tiring as you face the same pattern of beginning enemies again and again.\n\nAltough i cannot verify one thing it does feel like the game is always using the same random seed per session, so you will always face the same pattern of enemies every round, i would count down the seconds between each enemy spawn because i had been repeating the same pattern over and over (3 spawners, 1 super spawner and then the skull spider with more super spawners). \n\nHowever, despite that i have to say the game is exactly what i expected it to be when i got it and as such i am enjoying the nailbiting difficulty of it and i will probably play until i reach a point where i simply cannot beat my previous score. \n\nPros:\n- Really addicting and makes you want to constantly beat your previous score.\n- High speed movement and twitchy shooting makes the skill ceiling extremely high (tip: you can shotgun blast yourself up into the air)\n- The enemies are varied and are a constant challenge, however you can learn their patterns quite quickly\n- You will always want to dethrone your friends high score\n\nNeutral points:\n- From what i've noticed the game seed is always the same. I cannot verify this but whenever i play the enemy spawn is always the same so learning patterns is sometimes part of the challenge.\n\nCons:\n- Everything you see in the trailer is all there is in the game. There are no secrets, no story no nothing so if you get bored of the base game then there is nothing to hook you back in\n- There is no fov slider and altough the fov is not bad it can still cause some people motion sickness and cause it so you can't see enemies coming from the side.", "timestamp_created": 1456057001, "timestamp_updated": 1456057001, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21361106": {"recommendationid": "21361106", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970704194", "num_games_owned": 163, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 224, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1513280022}, "language": "german", "review": "HELL|YEAH!]]\nThis*Game*is\n-D--O--P--E-", "timestamp_created": 1456051986, "timestamp_updated": 1456051986, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21360413": {"recommendationid": "21360413", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960422850", "num_games_owned": 241, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 856, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512463829}, "language": "english", "review": "Metal as fuck.\n\nThis game is like a digital adrenaline on switch.\n\nThe gritty look and amazing sounds pair perfectly with the brutally simple gameplay and time attack scoreboard.\n\nhighly recommended!", "timestamp_created": 1456049675, "timestamp_updated": 1456306657, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21360017": {"recommendationid": "21360017", "author": {"steamid": "76561197979741653", "num_games_owned": 566, "num_reviews": 85, "playtime_forever": 546, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467890445}, "language": "english", "review": "Devil Daggers is an arcade scoring FPS. While this review is negative, it only means that I do not personally recommend the game. It does not mean that I think that this is a terrible game, so please do not vote me down just because you are a fanboy defending your game.\n\nThat being said, Devil Daggers consists of surviving as long as possible in a (very small) square where darkness reigns, while killing hundreds of skulls thrown at you. That's all there is to the game, no levels to beat, no permanent or temporary progression, just occasionally a new enemy type makes its appearance while the skulls keep swarming and swarming. \n\nTentacle pillars dispense skulls and need to be disposed of quickly after their first batch before they vomit an overwhelming army. Flying skulls are quick, they home in on the players, and are a CONSTANT pain to deal with. Very rarely there is a moment to breathe, which means that the pacing of the game is very intense, and in my opinion completely off. It feels tedious and repetitive. Moreover, always the same enemies are coming at the same moment, so unlike roguelites the player does not learn the systems and then adapt to different situations: here, the sequence is the same, so the player has to do the same thing over and over until they learn the partition of the music they play (although there is no in-game soundtrack).\n\nI would compare this game to Super Hexagon: play the sequence over and over until you get good at mastering it, and then get farther into the game.\n\nConversely, I suppose that some very skilled players would be able to get quite far without needing to learn the sequence, just by sheer skill of shooting and moving, The shooting consists of pressing once for shotgun or keeping the finger of the mouse for machine gun fire. Collecting gems from enemies (stop shooting to attract them like a magnet) eventually upgrades the firepower. Shooting feels good, just too bad that I am fighting swarms of skulls and not interesting enemy types that come in waves inside a bigger arena.\n\nA very interesting addition to this game is the ability to watch the replay from anyone in the leaderboard. Very useful to learn or just be mesmerized at the graphics without focusing on surviving.\n\nTo me the main draw of the game is the art style and atmosphere (although there is no in-game soundtrack). The graphics and gameplay throw back to Quake, and will probably attract the same kind of elitist crowd.

With every update comes new enemies and challenges, but be warned, this content is usually locked to the best of the best. It's a shame because the second large difficulty boost really puts your skill to the test. I'm slowly getting there, but that is the point of Devil Daggers. Die, die, and die until you overcome. Then start it up all over again.\n\nMy biggest reason for extending this review is because I feel like in the time that I've played Devil Daggers, I have literally become a better FPS player.\n\nThis game is like bootcamp for fast, movement heavy shooters such as Q3A, CPMA, Reflex, and (shoutout) Neotokyo.\n\nMovement, positioning, situational awareness, timing, and aim. All of these play such a big part in Devil Daggers that as long as you keep pushing yourself here, you'll keep getting better at everything else. How a game can be so focused on its objectives to the point where it spills over into other shooters in the genre shows that the game should be up there with the greats.

An endless survival mode has the possibility to be boring for some, even when everything else in it is great.\n\n-The sheer challenge of surviving long enough to see what other types of hellish hordes the game has to throw at you might be simply too challenging for some players to accomplish. So far, there are no easy modes or cheat codes to accomodate them, albeit if there were easy-modes/cheats, it would be best that the leaderboards would be disabled in those modes of course.\n\nOverall:\n\nThis game shows real heart, talent, and effort. It is beautifully Hellish, and capitolizes on this with it's punishing but satisfying gameplay.

Con\u00e7u comme un shooter boost\u00e9 a la coca\u00efne et a l'ambiance gla\u00e7ante, Devil Daggers est \u00e0 la hauteur du temps que vous comptez investir dedans.\n\nL'unique int\u00e9r\u00eat du jeu (hors ambiance visuelle et sonore) c'est son leaderboard. Si vous vous investissez dans Devil Daggers c'est pour tenter de voir votre nom le plus haut possible dans le classement. N\u2019esp\u00e9rez pas y trouver un autre int\u00e9r\u00eat, son gameplay en fait un jeu a scoring. Certes, c'est toujours sympathique histoire de vous faire une petite partie comme \u00e7a pour le fun apr\u00e8s une journ\u00e9e pourrie, mais je pense que ce qui rend Devil Daggers vraiment bon, c'est avant tout le joueur. Devil Daggers est frustrant, mais pas dans le sens ou il va faire rage-quit, mais plut\u00f4t dans le sens \u00ab\u00a0bordel je suis mort comme un con, je peux pas laisser passer \u00e7a, encore un essai\u00a0\u00bb. J'en suis a neufs heures de jeux et je pense y passer encore beaucoup afin de m'am\u00e9liorer ainsi que mon score.\n\nLe score, parlons en, est simplement le temps pendant lequel vous avez surv\u00e9cu avant de vous faire mis\u00e9rablement tuer. Une partie moyenne apr\u00e8s un temps d'adaptation et d'apprentissage du jeu, des m\u00e9caniques et des ennemis, est a peu pr\u00e8s de 2 minutes. Bien sur, au premier try il y a peu de chance que vous arriviez a ce score, mais au bout d'une petite heure, ce score sera largement atteint, pour peu que vous fassiez attention. En effet, la courbe de progression sur le jeu est tr\u00e8s agr\u00e9able et brosse toujours le joueur dans le sens du poil. \u00ab\u00a0T'es mort\u00a0? C'est que t'as fait une erreur, mais t\u2019inqui\u00e8tes, maintenant tu sais comment fonctionne cet ennemi et tu devrai \u00eatre en mesure d'\u00e9viter l'\u00e9chec au prochain try\u00a0\u00bb. Chacun des ennemi a un comportement bien sp\u00e9cifique, qui est de temps en temps alt\u00e9r\u00e9 selon votre placement et vos actions, mais c'est justement l'apprentissage de ces comportements qui vous fera survivre de plus en plus longtemps.\nBon maintenant, quid r\u00e9ellement du gameplay\u00a0? Comme je l'ai dit c'est un shooter charg\u00e9 \u00e0 la coco. Imaginez Quake (premier du nom) dans une ar\u00e8ne tr\u00e8s restreinte qui ne vous laisse pas de marge d'erreur. Si vous sortez de l'ar\u00e8ne, vous mourrez. Si vous vous prenez un ennemi, vous mourrez. Si vous foncez dans un pyl\u00f4ne qui fait office de spawner, vous mourrez. Une touche et c'est la mort, exp\u00e9ditive mais riche d'enseignement.\nA chaque ennemi (sauf les cranes de base), vous gagnez une gemme. Enfin, celle-ci tombe au sol et ne vous sera attribu\u00e9 que si vous la ramassez, ou si vous arr\u00eatez de tirer, vous laissant vuln\u00e9rable. Ces gemmes n'ont aucun int\u00e9r\u00eat pour le score de mani\u00e8re directe, mais concernant vos chances de survies... elle sont indispensables. A chaque palier (10 gemmes pour le premier, 60 gemmes pour le second, etc), le jeu vous donne une am\u00e9lioration pour vos dagues\u00a0: plus de cadence de tir, de dispersion pour votre tir \u00ab\u00a0shotgun\u00a0\u00bb, des dagues a t\u00eates chercheuses. Inutile de pr\u00e9ciser qu'elles seront plus que n\u00e9cessaires pour votre survie.\nPour survivre, l'apprentissage et les gemmes ne seront pas vos seuls alli\u00e9s. Vous pouvez aussi profiter d'un panel de moyen de d\u00e9placement. Courir tout simplement ne suffira pas a survivre aux assauts incessants, par contre, vous pouvez faire du bunny-hopping ainsi que du rocket jump pour profiter d'une plus grande vitesse. Mais attention, vous perdrez aussi en contr\u00f4le et vous risquez de vous jeter t\u00eate la premi\u00e8re hors de l'ar\u00e8ne ou dans un ennemi.\nPlus haut, j'ai parl\u00e9 d'une ambiance gla\u00e7ante. Je ne parlais pas simplement de l'esth\u00e9tique infernale, des cranes volants, des spawners a tentacules. Le jeu profite d'un sound design absolument parfait, qui n'est pas juste l\u00e0 pour vous faire fr\u00e9mir, puisqu'il est vital de faire extr\u00eamement attention aux sons environnants pour savoir ou sont les diff\u00e9rents ennemis et pour \u00e9viter de vous faire avoir b\u00eatement dans le dos.\nN'essayez pas de nettoyer enti\u00e8rement l'ar\u00e8ne, mais soyez pr\u00e9cis. Privil\u00e9giez les cibles susceptibles de vous amener vers la mort. Le jeu vous encouragera a plus faire du crowd control qu'il ne fera de vous un Rambo des enfers. Aussi les cranes simples ne seront pas ceux qui vous poseront le plus de probl\u00e8mes vu qu'ils vous suivent b\u00eatement (m'enfin, ne soyez pas trop confiant non plus, des runs se sont termin\u00e9es de mani\u00e8res abrupt par un exc\u00e8s de confiance).\nDevil Daggers permet aussi de farmer les gemmes, en laissant les spawners cracher des hordes infernales. Plus de gemmes, plus de pouvoir comme je l'ai dit, mais c'est un risque cons\u00e9quent, aussi bien au niveau des ennemis qui se feront plus nombreux, mais aussi des spawners susceptibles de freiner votre bunny hopping  a reculons de mani\u00e8re assez cocasse... Oui en crevant comme un con.\n\nBref, pour faire clair et concis, Devil Daggers est le jeu de scoring que j'attendais depuis longtemps. L'ex\u00e9cution est quasi parfaite, je ne pourrais que lui reprocher une perte de contr\u00f4le d\u00e8s que l'ont fait du bunny hopping, mais m\u00eame la je chipote, le syst\u00e8me est si bien r\u00e9alis\u00e9 que l'on peut faire du bunny hopping en cercle. Je pourrais aussi pester contre les ennemis qui ont des fois des comportements un peu al\u00e9atoires, mais la encore je chipote. Devil Daggers vaut tr\u00e8s largement ses 5 euros et rien qu'avec les 9 heures pass\u00e9es dessus j'ai largement rentabilis\u00e9 l'investissement.

Infact that's the real goal. To survive as long as possible.\n\nThe mechanics are pretty simple. You can shoot a stream of \"devil daggers\" or tap your shoot key for a shotgun-like burst. You can also collect red jewels as you kill larger enemies to improve your devil daggers' strength. It's all about micromanaging your spatial awareness, and priority in what to kill. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgq7yKxj4tw\nThough the premise is simple enough, the challenge is incredibly high. You'll get overwhelmed with enemies very quickly if you're not careful. Surviving for longer than a minute per round is a true achievement. There is an addictive value to the game's design loop with \"one more game\" as the initiative to replay over and over again. \n\nThe game's visuals are striking and stylized. With an eerie Gothic horror look, rendered in a pixel-3D aesthetic. The sound design is disturbing and compliment it's visuals quite well. It presents a moody atmosphere that drew me in.\n\nThe game can certainly be considered repetitive, and with only one mode to play it dosn't help it's repetition. After playing just a few rounds I quickly understood why the game was so cheap at $5.00 USD. There really isn't much content here. Luckily for us, what is here is addictive, challenging, and satasfying.\n\nOverall, Devil Daggers is a cheap, grotesquely gorgeous endless shooter that is well suited for score attackers. It's short on content, but makes it up an addictive designed gameplay loop. \n\nPros:\n- Atmospheric visual and sound design\n- Incredibly challenging\n- Very addictive\n- Appropriate price tag\n\nCons:\n- Short on content\n- Might not be for everyone\n\n\u25ba Devil Daggers hours played: 2\n\u25ba Completion Status on Devil Daggers: N/A\n\u25ba This copy of Devil Daggers provided by the developers", "timestamp_created": 1455978578, "timestamp_updated": 1455978578, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 31, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.678015", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21340590": {"recommendationid": "21340590", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037386293", "num_games_owned": 846, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 87, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493417584}, "language": "english", "review": "Straight forward and simplistic first person shooter where you try to survive as long as possible.\nGlobal and Friends leaderboards with the ability to watch replays straight from the leaderboards.\n\nThe artstyle reminds me of a cross between DOOM and QUAKE.

Gameplay is stripped down to the absolute bare minimum, there's only one goal; seemingly to stay alive for as long as possible.

The graphics and engine and movement are inspired by classics such as Quake and Doom and it looks absolutely outstanding.\n\nUnfortunately, that's where my praise ends.  It says I've only played 0.3 hours, but it requires less time than that to explore the features of the game outside of the need to keep practicing the game to get better to hopefully make it to the end.\n\n*edit: I spent 2 more hours on this game to get into the top 10% of the leaderboard (at the time) and to make another video because I was unfair in the one I linked here.  My opinion is unchanged.\n\nFrankly, there isn't anywhere close to 5 dollars worth of content in this game.  You get one relatively small arena with no physical obstacles, no differentiation in how the game begins, with one gun that supposedly upgrades as you proceed (though admittedly I'm not good enough to get that far).  You know what else you can get for 5 dollars?  The Binding of Isaac.\n\nThere is a replay feature that you can find from the leaderboards to see how the best of the best get through it, which is actually pretty cool.  That's a feature I'd love to see in more games in some capacity.\n\nI can respect what this game wants to do with its movement and its graphical style and its engine and I think all that is really cool, but it simply needs more.  One arena with one gun with one set of waves simply is not enough.  What really confuses me is how this game currently has over 90 positive reviews singing its praises and only 7 negative reviews that are constantly being flagged as \"unhelpful\" for some reason.  It almost seems a little bit sketchy, as I've seen better games get shat on for less.\n\nAlso, there is no invert mouse option.  In 2016, there's no invert mouse option in a first person shooter.

I would like to see something more in the area in which you fight, like small obstacles or walls, because like this it tends to get repetitive.\n\n[h1]GAMEPLAY[/h1]\nYour goal is to survive an endless wave of monsters for as long as you can. Your only weapon is an unlimited amount of daggers that you shoot from your hand. The longer you play, more monsters start appearing, and you unlock some bonuses for your attack. You can also bunnyhop to gain more speed.\nThis is literally the entire game. It's simple, straight-forward and hard to master. It does get very repetitive after a while, and it works better in short game sessions.\n\n[h1]CHALLENGE[/h1]\nThe game is tough as nails: you die with one hit by either getting hit by enemies, running into them, or falling off the map. Only masochists and hardcore Quake fans will really enjoy playing this game.\n\n[h1]SOUND[/h1]\nThe sound design is pretty solid, however it does lack a lot in music and you will easily get annoyed by the constant throwing of daggers and monster noises after a bunch of minutes.\n\n[h1]REPLAYABILITY[/h1]\nYou also want to play another time, just to get a higher score. But you probably won't. It gets very frustrating, but if you like to get better scores every time you will most definitely spend hours and hours mastering this game.\n\nOverall, fans of endless shooters will have a blast playing this game, and for its cheap price I do recommend it. Remember that it is tough as nails and kind of repetitive in the long run.\n\n[h1]Story: n/a\nGraphics: 7.5\nGameplay: 7\nChallenge: 8.5\nSound: 6.5\nReplayability: 8\n\n[b]ENJOYMENT: 7\nFRUSTRATION: 8.5[/b][/h1]\n\nFollow me on Twitter: @nickygra97\n[url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_VuBkttXIrpbrxwfYL_B-w]Subscribe to my channel[/url]\n[url=http://www.facebook.com/EnjoyTheGaming]Like on Facebook[/url]\n[url=http://nickygra.wix.com/enjoythegaming]Check my official website[/url]\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/EnjoyTheGaming]Join my Steam group[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1455891232, "timestamp_updated": 1455891232, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.461087", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21316635": {"recommendationid": "21316635", "author": {"steamid": "76561198098656146", "num_games_owned": 663, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 65, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474644118}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u597d\u8a55\u306e\u3088\u3046\u3060\u304c\u81ea\u5206\u306b\u306f\u5408\u308f\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f\u3002\n\u8996\u91ce\u306e\u5916\u304b\u3089\u653b\u6483\u3055\u308c\u305f\u308a\u3001\u885d\u7a81\u3057\u305f\u308a\u3057\u3066\n\u7e70\u308a\u8fd4\u3057\u6b7b\u306c\u3053\u3068\u304c\u9762\u767d\u3044\u3068\u601d\u308f\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f\u3002\n\n\u540c\u3058\u3088\u3046\u306a\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3067\u6700\u8fd1\u30ea\u30ea\u30fc\u30b9\u3055\u308c\u305f\n\u3053\u308c\u3088\u308a\u3082\u5b89\u304498\u5186\u3068\u3044\u3046\u4fa1\u683c\u306e\nSHOWTIME 2073\n\u3068\u3044\u3046FPS\u306e\u307b\u3046\u304c\u500b\u4eba\u7684\u306b\u306f\n\u9762\u767d\u3044\u3068\u611f\u3058\u305f\u3002\n", "timestamp_created": 1455886297, "timestamp_updated": 1455886297, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.363946", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21316272": {"recommendationid": "21316272", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030355818", "num_games_owned": 1343, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 115, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490622105}, "language": "english", "review": "i love it, it feels like orthodox and ambient black metal like Ondskapt or 1349, or Urfaust or Lustmord", "timestamp_created": 1455884897, "timestamp_updated": 1455884897, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.471301", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21316227": {"recommendationid": "21316227", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000388770", "num_games_owned": 364, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 288, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506245326}, "language": "english", "review": "I suck at this game but its really fun.\n\nFor $5 you're getting a game with:\n\n* Distinct and beautiful visual style, audio effects is top notch\n* Extremely satisfying gameplay that's really really fast\n* A real challenge\n- It isn't a very deep game, it's just survive as long as you can\n- Probably will get repetitive really quickly but the existance of the online leaderboards helps a bit\n\nDon't get this game if you can't handle playing too fast or going from 0 to 100 in terms of pressure and panic real quickly.

It's a simple game where the few moving parts are made beautifully.  You have one gun, the Devil Daggers, that can fire like a shotgun or machinegun.  You shoot the weakpoints and collect them to upgrade your fingers. WASD movement.  Survive long enough to get on the leaderboards.  That's it.\n\nExcept that isn't just it.\n\nIt's a game about making a million binary choices every second.\n\nThe first enemies you face are a tower that spews a swarm of fast moving skulls and one bigger one that just kind of runs away.  Do you destroy the tower quickly, or clear the mobs first?  Depends on the moment. Destroy a few and a massive skull spider shows up.  You need to destroy it quickly or it'll send out a bunch of spider hatchlings.  But wait, the larger skulls from earlier just flipped over, have 5 times the health, are chasing you now, and are cackling maniacly.  Do you destroy the laughing skulls and risk the spiders hatching?  \n\nMaybe you just want to run away.  Game's got you covered.  You can bunnyhop easily by jumping every time you hit the ground, making you slightly faster than the swarms of skulls.  Of course, then you can't turn easily.  Do you want to risk bunnyhopping when it could lead you into a swarm you could easily avoid on foot, or will the speed be your best bet at the moment?  Need to just go backwards as fast as possible?  Or possibly up?  Use the shotgun blast to rocketjump.  You got away!  Of course, you might accidentally launch yourself off the edge of the arena.  Is going backwards worth that risk?\n\nSee?  Just a bunch of simple risk/reward choices.  But you only have one health, so every choice matters.  And even the first enemy makes you make 3 of those decisions the moment you set eyes on it.  Should I bunnyhop towards it or not? Should I shoot the crystal to destroy the tower or focus on the swarms.  Should I try and kill the larger skull it spawned that's leaving me alone at this moment?\n\nAnd every enemy just starts piling these choices on.\n\nMore and more.\n\nFaster and faster.\n\nIt's the risk/reward of Galaga with the graphics of what Quake wanted to be.  \n\nIf you like arcade games:  GET THIS.\n\n\nP.S.

It feels nothing like Doom/Quake - the ONLY weapon you get is boring to use, there isn't a proper level to run through (just a wide open room), and the beginning enemies are so monotonous that you won't feel a drive to even excel at the game. If you want a hard FPS throwback game with a bit of roguelite, I'd recommend [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/308420/]Ziggurat[/url], [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/266110/]Tower of Guns[/url], [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/250580]Paranautical Activity[/url] or just go to the source and get Doom and Quake.\n\nDevil Daggers might claim to be inspired by 1990s FPS games, but make no mistake: this is nothing like Doom or Quake. \n\nYou're dropped onto a wide open circle of ground and enemies spawn randomly on the edge, spewing tons of flying skulls when they do. If you get hit once, you die. There is nowhere to hide and the area is dark so some enemies will be hidden in that darkness. In Doom/Quake, a lot of the gunplay came from moving quickly through cooridors, finding secrets, ducking in and out of doorway cover and being surprised by a monster closet opening behind you. This game only spawns monsters around you with very little fanfare, and you'll spend most of your time simply bunny hopping and circle strafing. That's it. This might be a fluid movement system but it does not supply an enjoyable nor interesting space to use it in.\n\nThe difficulty is very high, as you'd expect. I can appreciate one-hit difficulty, but frequently you'll die because something spawned behind you without much or any warning, or one lone skull did a Tokyo drift and nipped your ankle, or something else altogether. The game won't give you feedback about WHY you died. Probably a lone enemy snuck up on you? Who knows. There are tons of floating skulls everywhere but it simply isn't fun or interesting to fight them or die to them. In the end, the game killing you doesn't feel frustrating or terribly unfair really - it's just kind of boring. \n\nThe only weapon you get is the devil daggers. If you click mouse-1, you have a weak shotgun attack that is nothing like the boomstick from Doom. It feels like a nerf gun. If you HOLD mouse-1, you get a minigun like weapon that actually does feel good to use.  I don't know why they chose to tie these firing modes to the same button (you can't remap this either!) - it feels clumsy to use and it often will not work at all, simply giving you a one shot from the minigun instead of the shotgun. Combining the weakness of the shotgun shot with the unreliability of the controls, I'm not sure why you'd bother to use it. Apparently the game gives you homing daggers for mouse-2 at SOME point, but I honestly never played enough to get there before I got extremely bored.\n\nNormally in difficult games, you'll have a desire to get better at the game, to learn from your mistakes, and last a bit longer next time. I didn't have that feeling in this game. The gun (dagger?) play felt so dull that I just accepted each death and tried again. 45 minutes later, I felt like I only got marginally better but had no desire to try again. There are 10 more enemy types that I never got to see, but I simply don't care enough to play longer to get to that content. I also never got any double jump, nor homing daggers, or any upgrade. \n\nFinally, you can watch replays of the top scores on the leaderboards, so you can watch people who have mastery over the game play. It's a lot of circle strafing and holding mouse-1. Not the most riveting gameplay to watch, but you can appriciate how good these people are at the game. I'm just not sure why they feel driven to achieve that mastery when it just doesn't seem interesting to get there. There are better, deeper games out there that fill this niche.\n", "timestamp_created": 1455844693, "timestamp_updated": 1455844693, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 127, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502750", "comment_count": "24", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21308265": {"recommendationid": "21308265", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012594872", "num_games_owned": 199, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1010, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500316471}, "language": "english", "review": "Looks and plays great!

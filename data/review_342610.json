HyperRogue. It's a game where the procedures are simple, but the possibilities are endless.\n\nFirst of all, I have a slight bias when it comes to this game. I'm a mathematician (at least, in the sense that I have a math degree and that I teach high school math), so the idea of a game that involves hyperbolic geometry is very appealing to me right at the start. But let's talk about the rest of the game's appeal first.\n\nYou're in a world that is, in some ways, larger than infinite. Imagine a flat plane, that extands out in all directions forever. Due to it's strange geometry, HyperRogue's world is even bigger than that. One thing that's interesting about this is just how different things are because of that: in many worlds that we imagine in fantasy, there are often only superficial differences between them and the world that we know. Now try to imagine a place where the laws of nature did not function as we expect them to. That is the alien nature of HyperRogue's world.\n\nMany playthroughs only scratch the surface: you need to clear 10 worlds (with certain other conditions) to win the game, but the game contains over 50, so on any two playthroughs, you may see very little overlap. In my 18 hours of playtime (as of this writing), there are many worlds I've never even reached, let alone really explored (but I'm also not very good, so Your Mileage May Vary). And the worlds are very unique. In some worlds, you can't stand still. In some worlds, you can climb the bodies of dead enemies to reach higher terrain. In some worlds, the terrain IS made of enemies who are sleeping...until they wake up and come after you. And in one world, you're playing Minesweeper. And in most worlds, things that are impossible in our world become possible. So there's always more to learn and do.\n\nMany of your abilities are based on actual properties in hyperbolic geometry. You can use the properties of the world's negative curvature to escape your enemies as they close in on you. Areas that would close up in dead ends open up into a garden of forking paths. You can travel inside an endless sequence of concentric circles. Just be careful not to get lost: for every step you take from your starting point, the amount of spaces you can reach is doubled.\n\nAnd for you math geeks out there, the game has a plethora of content for you, from various display modes to see what hyperbolic geometry looks like, like Poincare models or hypersian rugs, to worlds that you can play in Euclidian (ie, normal for us) mode...just to see how strange the hyperbolic world really is. \n\nIf you like mathematical geometry, this is a game for you (at least, to hold you over until Miegakure comes out).

Do not be fooled by its humble appearance. This is no ordinary lamp.\n\nIt is, loosely, in the roguelike genre, meaning that it has a fail / die / retry loop, and you are intended to learn from multiple playthroughs. It is turn based and you have infinite thinking time. As you collect treasure, enemies spawn more quickly, causing emergent game situations. You can kill enemies by moving into them.\n\nThe presentation is simple, but that's because there is a lot to communicate. There is very little distance between the gamer and the game here. You can play the entire game with the mouse. The game even keeps you from making simple mistakes that would kill you in one move.\n\nThus, every time you lose, it is due to a complicated mistake.\n\nIts genius comes from its map, the non-Euclidean hyperbolic surface. In a hex grid or square grid, the number of cells you can reach by walking in a given direction is approximately the square of the distance. In this game, the number of cells you can reach in the same distance is exponential. It is a garden of endlessly forking paths. New gamers have very bad intuitions about this game world. I advise you to wander through the tutorial.\n\nAs you collect treasures, you will also unlock new regions to explore. Each region has its own internal logic that plays somehow with the nature of the hyperbolic surface in a unique way.\n\nBut the most important game is happening in between your ears. The sense of mastery is incredibly satisfying. It rivals the very best puzzle games.\n\nFor more variety, there are additional game modes to explore beyond the base game, such as score attacks with leaderboards.\n\nMy time with this game is being underreported, because I also bought it for mobile. It plays the same online, on phone, and on tablet as it does on PC. It is eating my life in the best way.\n\nEpilogue: how in the name of the infinite hyperbolic lands was this game [i]invented[/i]?", "timestamp_created": 1511422050, "timestamp_updated": 1511422050, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.536625", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36832655": {"recommendationid": "36832655", "author": {"steamid": "76561197988609531", "num_games_owned": 130, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 101, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510879783}, "language": "english", "review": "A puzzle game that gives you motion-sickness", "timestamp_created": 1511388949, "timestamp_updated": 1511388949, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496614", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36441575": {"recommendationid": "36441575", "author": {"steamid": "76561198404208817", "num_games_owned": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1228, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510398120}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game.

Starting off in this game, you have a few lands to start out with, each one has simple rules on the surface, temperature can rise and melt blocks in ice land, there are worms that will die at dead ends in the desert, the walls in the living caves move according to complex rules you should probably just not think about. \n\nThose are three of the starting worlds you have, but as you collect treasure and kill enemies and unlock new worlds, you start encountering more abstract or complex rulesets. Without spoiling too much, it gets to the point where there's a minesweeper world. Like, you're just playing minesweeper in a roguelike. and this is all on top of the game's base appeal, which is already pretty significant.\n\nBasically, it's a top-down game where you move one space at a time and other enemies move at the same time, which is pretty standard roguelike fare, but the game is also rendered as non-euclidean spaces. Basically that means that space behaves differently from how it does in our world, and you'd be forgiven for thinking it's just a fish-eye lens over a standard 2D space. In addition to THAT, the game also works on chess rules; you can't make a move that would kill you, and you lose if you can't make a move that doesn't kill you. With some exceptions, enemies die in one hit, so there's no levelling system (well, not a conventional one at least)\n\nInstead of levelling up, collecting enough treasure in a single world will cause power ups specific to that world to spawn for that run. It's a really unique and refreshing take on a progression system that makes collecting random trinkets feel really rewarding.\n\nThe only issue I have with this game is that it takes a WHILE to build yourself up to a high score, and death comes fast, and you might not see it coming. If you're like me and have a hard time thinking multiple steps ahead, you might find yourself getting really frustrated at this game.

It\u2019s certainly a weird one. But it\u2019s a brilliant, good kind of weird that certain types of gamers should really check out.\n\n[i]HyperRogue[/i] is a mind-bending game of chess that takes place on a world that\u2019s quite unlike our own. The object of the game is to collect as much treasure as possible without getting one-hit killed and succumbing to permadeath (as the \u2018Rogue\u2019 in the title might suggest) but\u2026 navigating the world is a challenge unlike any you\u2019ve ever met before. You know how, in real life, things appear smaller as they get farther away? Like how the horizon only looks like it\u2019s a few feet long to your eyes, when in reality it spans miles? As it turns out, on a hyperbolic plane, this effect is compounded: the horizon is much, much longer than it would be in real life. Two paths that appear near to one another will take you in completely opposite directions. The world is structured in such a way that is impossible for your poor spatial senses to intuitively understand, so scrolling something off the screen will mean that it\u2019s probably lost forever unless you\u2019re keeping close track of landmarks.\n\nWhat makes the game really shine is the fact that the hyperbolic plane isn\u2019t just an artistic gimmick; it\u2019s the game\u2019s lifeblood. The most basic game mechanic \u2013 the combat \u2013 is only able to work because of the strange, warped nature of the game\u2019s space. You can get killed in one hit, but so can enemies. So, to survive huge mob encounters, you have to funnel them down into lines so you can kill them one at a time. The trick is, in this world it\u2019s impossible for two things to run side-by-side in the same direction forever \u2013 they\u2019ll eventually block one another and impede their own progress as the space compresses, so you can funnel them down just by fleeing in the correct direction. And if you can\u2019t fight, you\u2019ve got a [i]huge[/i] horizon waiting for you, and you need to know how to pick the safest direction to run.\n\nSound confusing? That\u2019s only the beginning; you need to learn how to keep from getting flanked if you want to survive for more than twenty steps. Venture beyond the starting land and you\u2019ll encounter some truly crazy stuff! Climb trees with infinite numbers of branches, stand in rooms that are enclosed by half a dozen parallel lines all pointed in different directions, explore circles with centers that are always infinitely far away from you, wield swords that can only be aimed by [i]turning the world around you[/i]\u2026  The programmer of HyperRogue seems to be a mathematical genius who truly understands the strange, otherworldly quirks of a hyperbolic plane and expresses his understanding through the gameplay itself, creating game mechanics that explore the differences between the game world and our normal world of Euclidian space. That\u2019s something truly special.\n\nThe gameplay itself gets tense very quickly. Worlds spawn more monsters the more treasure you collect from them, and the core skill of the game is the ability to get out of problem situations before they become impossible. There\u2019s also a \u201cbuild order\u201d strategy to consider, as you have to pick which worlds to tackle that will unlock magical orbs that will help you survive in other worlds. You'll need strategy, skill, and outright tenacity to beat some of the game's insane challenges. Fail, and you might rage hard enough to throw your keyboard out the window, but the next minute you'll be hooking it right back up to try again.\n\nThe game is still in active development, as the developer is [i]very[/i] active in the community as of this writing, and pushes frequent bugfix patches as well as huge updates that add new worlds, game mechanics, UI fixes and ease-of-use features. The community is very friendly, with several power-players who are more than happy to help you understand the game\u2019s concepts and the mathematical principles behind them.\n\nI\u2019ll admit, as I play more and more games throughout my lifetime, I\u2019ve found that I\u2019ve come to respect and value novelty over mere quality, and [i]HyperRogue[/i] is a monumental example of a novel concept executed perfectly. It\u2019s not just weird, it [i]works[/i] as a game, and it works in such a way that no other game can.This is quite possibly the best proof-of-concept game I\u2019ve ever seen in my life, and I\u2019m not ashamed to give it a 10/10. It continues to stretch and blow my mind every time I play.\n\n(Achievement Hunters: Care about your 100% count? Stay far away; you\u2019ll never finish this one. Care about AGC%? Proceed with extreme caution. Care about AStats score? Dive right in; this is a gold mine of extremely high-valued achievements, as long as you're persistant enough to get good at the game.)", "timestamp_created": 1485339894, "timestamp_updated": 1485340089, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 32, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.776994", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29450399": {"recommendationid": "29450399", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069135849", "num_games_owned": 715, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 1410, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510973871}, "language": "english", "review": "Tremendous roguelike!

The hyperbolic geometry feels fresh and introduces tons of interesting quirks and mechanics that you would never see in regular roguelikes. The overall design of the game feels very polished. The game has a crazy amount of content (currently over 50 different lands!) and is quite actively updated with even more.\n\nThis game is by no means easy, in fact it will most likely take anyone hundreds of hours to master all the lands and mechanics. You will die a lot. You will have the best attempt you've ever had and die to a stupid mistake you made because you weren't paying enough attention. The balance is, however, fair; if you take the time to learn a land, you will be able to consistently collect 10 treasures, or even up to 25 without a big trouble.\n\nIn a recent update the game got a big graphical overhaul which made it look quite nice. Some of the sprites are basic and could be improved, but this doesn't really bother me. The soundtrack is solid, but after getting so many new lands in all the updates, I wish there were more songs in the game.\n\nAnother thing I wish there were more is endgame options. Currently, you can \"beat\" the game by collecting 10 treasures from 9 different lands, collecting 10 more from Hell, finding an Orb of Yendor and unlocking it with a key you need to find and then return to the Orb. The other major thing you can try to achieve is to unlock Hyperstones, for which you need to collect 10 treasures from ALL the lands. As far as I know, only a handful of players has ever managed to achieve this, even less in the current version with all the new lands. The difficulty gap between achieving a Yendor Orb victory and unlocking Hyperstones is massive, and it would be nice if there were more options and milestones inbetween; maybe new different end goals, some of which could even be mutually exclusive in a single run. The current few special quests are interesting but not very fun to try to go for too often.\n\nOverall, this game is amazing and addicting.

[/b]\n\nHyperRogue came highly recommended to me so as a fan of roguelikes I jumped right in and so far I'm loving everything the game has to offer. Although the gameplay seems a little basic it gets a more complex as you play further and unlock new lands and power-ups. \n\nYou start with no tutorial, but you should be able to pick the gameplay up pretty quickly without too much trouble. You can press F1 for help though and that'll explain the bare basics if you want something to get you started.\nYour aim is to traverse the strange world you've found yourself in, collecting treasures you find and slaying monsters in your path. There is a goal but this isn't explained until later on and you've unlocked more treasures. The movement is turnbased and as you move your enemies do too and the world around you can also change. You encounter various different 'worlds' as you travel and each of these differs from the others massively. Each land contains different monsters, treasures, powerups, music and land effects. Some worlds are living and change as you move, others will slowly flood themselves so you must move quickly or find a boat, and some can only be crossed in certain directions or by using certain tiles. This is just a small selection of the worlds I have encountered so far and there seem to be a lot more I've not yet unlocked. \nCombat in the game is simple at first look as all enemies can be killed with just one click but as you collect more treasure within a land more monsters will spawn there. If you do not carefully plan your movement, which worlds to travel through and when to fight vs fleeing you will quickly be surrounded and lose the game. This being said you cannot move to a tile that will cause you death unless there are no other options, so you will not get a game over if there are any options for you to survive, instead you will be prompted to choose a different tile. This adds a fantastic puzzle/strategy element to the game and allows you to plan what you want to do rather than try to rush through it all. \n\nFor some reason the gameplay reminded me of the old ASCII roguelikes which was fantastic as most new entries to the genre take the name without really having the feel; HyperRogue delivers perfectly without having graphics that some would find unbearable. \n\nFor such a simple looking game there is a lot going on at once and a lot that contributes to the puzzle elements of the game. Where more monsters spawn the more treasure you have in those lands you must carefully pick which lands you want to enter and which to avoid. The shape of the map can be deceptive at times leading enemies to seem further than they actually are which can take a little getting used to. The map around you can also change with every move that you take so you'll  need to spend time monitoring your surroundings closely. All of this makes the gameplay very enjoyable and even a little intense at times as you see hordes of monsters surrounding you. \n\nThere are multiple gamemodes including a 'shoot'em up mode' which removes the turnbased movement and allows you to play in real time. There is also a hardcore mode where the game allows you to make moves that'll result in your death, and a map editor. There are many other gamemodes available but I haven't tried these yet as they aren't explained in game when you go to play them.\nThere have been multiple large updates which have added new lands and/or new game modes. I am unsure on if the developers plan to add anything new but the updates and interaction with the community is always an added extra and it's nice to see developers fleshing out the game in updates rather than DLC.\n\nMy only con to the game is the lack of explanation in some areas like the extra game modes. I tried to dabble in a few of them but got quickly confused. I'm sure over time I'll work out what they do as I plan on playing a lot more, but it still would have been nice to have them explained from the start. Other than that I really can't find anything to fault HyperRogue for, the game is simply fantastic. \n\n[b]There are very few roguelikes out there like HyperRogue and even less that come close to it. It is an unmissable title for anyone out there who considers themselves a fan of the genre and there is more than enough content included for the price. There is a reason that at the time of writing the reviews are 94% positive: HyperRogue is one of the most enjoyable roguelikes I've played. I don't tend to try many of the games I get in cheap bundles but this time I am really glad I did.

The game is turn-based in the sense that everytime you move, enemies also move. The game doesn\u2019t allow you to move to tiles which would result in your death, and thus, the game is over when the next move will result in your inability to move. \n\nThe main goal of the game is to find one of the Orbs of Yendor, or if you prefer, get the highest score possible by collecting treasure. This is where the game gets interesting, because the world itself is divided into many different lands and the more treasure you pick up in a given land, the more difficult the game will get because more, and more dangerous, monsters will spawn. These lands are very different from one another and each of them makes it feel like it is another game entirely, and each has its own unique music. Off the top of my head, I can remember this land where the tiles you (and enemies) step on will collapse, but there are also living caves in which the walls move around you, a jungle area where there are living ivies trying to kill you, a land where if you touch a mirror it will create copies of yourself, an area in which there is water and land at the same time and you have to use a boat to move across the water and there is even a sector which is filled with mines! As you can see, there is plenty of content in this game and I feel like I\u2019ve just barely scratched the surface of it, because in order to unlock more areas you need to collect \u201cX\u201d amount of treasure and I\u2019m not that good at the game, yet.\n\nWith this in mind, and from what I gathered, one of the main features of the game, which makes it unique among others in the genre, is the fact that it takes place in a hyperbolic plane. The best way for you to see how this actually changes the gameplay is just to watch a video of it and then imagine if the game was made in a euclidean plane (2D). The game actually offers a mode to play like this so that you can see the difference, along with a shoot \u2018em up mode that is real-time and allows for co-op, as well as various other modes which I haven\u2019t tried out yet. One of the major ways this affects the gameplay is that it is rather easy to get lost and lose track of where you came, because, as you move, the map kind of rotates on itself. It is really hard for me to put this in to words and explain it to you because even I don\u2019t really understand how it works.\n\n[b][u]Final Thoughts:[/u][/b][list]\n[*]Easy to learn, hard to master\n[*]Tons of content - even after a year of its Steam release it still gets updated with new content\n[*]Unique idea, perspective and world design\n[/list]\n\nDespite the simple yet odd looking visuals, the gameplay and mechanics of HyperRogue more than make up for it. HyperRogue provides a unique, challenging and exciting experience that can be played in just a few minutes or can go on for hours straight.\n\nIf you\u2019re like me and enjoy playing various different rogue-likes due to their discrepancy in game mechanics, I think you\u2019ll have a wonderful time with HyperRogue. Initially, partly because of its minimalist design I was somewhat skeptical about trying this one out, but I decided to take a leap of fate. I\u2019m glad I\u2019ve done so.

The puzzles are challenging and interesting, first to understand, and then to solve. That gameplay is perfectly crafted, and what makes it shine is the setting. Hyperrogue puts you in the middle of a bizarre, truly unique world.\n\nPeople seem to find it fashionable to drop the phrase \"non-Euclidean\" in order to give a Lovecraftian vibe of otherworldly, incomprehensible mystery to their video games or novels. HyperRogue is the first instance I've seen where it actually applies in more than that buzzword sense, and in a way that meaningfully changes the game from what it would be in a more traditional, orthographic view. It's hard to explain, but if you watch a video of the gameplay, you'll immediately see what I mean.\n\nEach world in HyperRogue is a self-contained set of specific, logical changes to the universe's rules. They are unique from one another and they all require different strategies and tactics. Enemies and random placement of treasure complicate these rules and make the game feel less like something you can solve in a mathematical sense and more like an organic game, though strictly speaking, there is always a Correct move. Planning ahead is the only way you'll make it past the first few worlds; if you don't understand what you're doing, or if you move without purpose, you will quickly find yourself in a hopeless scenario.\n\nI really, really love this game. It's only flaws are the immediacy with which it throws you into the game, with very little in the way of help or advice, though I imagine that's intentional and part of the charm.\n\nIf you're in the market for a quick pick-up-and-play game with a great deal of depth, this is the game for you. Please purchase it!\n\n---\n\n*You'll excuse a bit of pedantry that I find myself putting out more and more often as the \"roguelike\" moniker takes hold in every steam game's tags.

So, what does that mean, specifically?\n\nFirst of all, it's a minimalist roguelike, and there is no equipment, and no items except for Orbs (basically spells) which are often activated upon pick up. Hyperrogue is turn- and grid-based, and combat rules are simple: Every attack is guaranteed to hit, and is usually deadly - for monsters as well as for the player. As a roguelike, it has permadeath. To avoid accidental player deaths, the game prevents you from performing actions that immediately result in your death, though there's a hardcore mode for the more confident players.\nBasically, the goal is to collect as much treasure as possible in different game modes, either in total, or for a specific type of treasure. In addition, there are some very challenging quests (most of which would be easy in a Euclidean setting), and a lot of achievements and leaderboard categories.\n\nThe game is easy to pick up, but difficult to master, and is suitable for anyone from casual players to science nerds or hardcore players. However, be warned that there are no difficulty modes, so it can be frustrating, and you won't be able to unlock certain game modes (chaos mode, Orb of Yendor challenge mode) unless you're very ambitious. Also, you have to be a top player to legally get 100% achievements.\n\nAbout the more unusual aspect:\nHyperrogue is the only elaborate game that I know which features hyperbolic geometry, a type of non-Euclidean geometry! To give a short explanation for this weird kind of geometry, I start with the other (more intuitive) type of non-Euclidean geometry, elliptic geometry: 2-dimensional elliptic geometry is simply the surface of a sphere. So if inhabitants of Earth couldn't move up or down, they'd be living in an elliptic plane. As a grid, we could combine regular hexagons and pentagons in a way that 2 hexagons and 1 pentagon meet in a vertex, which gives us a \"football\".\nEuclidean geometry is the \"normal\" geometry we're used to, and the Euclidean plane is simply a flat surface. For a grid we can use regular hexagons.\nNow hyperbolic geometry is kind of special: While we can combine regular hexagons and pentagons to get a (positively curved) plane, a possible grid for hyperbolic geometry consists of regular hexagons and heptagons, making it \"negatively curved\". If we try to do that in the Euclidean world we are living in, we get a wrinkled surface resembling the structure of corals, and it gets more extreme the larger the structure becomes, to the point where our Euclidean universe can't handle the non-Euclidean madness.\nHowever, Hyperrogue uses another method of representation (see Poincar\u00e9 disk model), the same which you see in M. C. Escher's [i]Circle Limit[/i] patterns: In this kind of representation, cells appear smaller the further away they are from the center, and quickly become too small to display on the screen. But if we travel to those cells, we'll see they're the same size as other cells. :)\n\nAn interesting property of hyperbolic geometry is that space extends more quickly, and you could fit the surface area of Earth in a circle with a comparably small radius. As a consequence, walking a few steps, and then walking back in the approximately (but not exactly) same direction will likely cause you to end up in an entirely different place, so it's very easy to get lost! Another consequence is that escaping pursuers is easier: Head towards a seemingly small gap between two pursuers, and that gap will turn out to be larger than expected! Also, there is no exact equivalent to \"parallels\" in a Euclidean geometry, and if your pursuers try to walk in parallel, the outer ones have to travel a larger distance, and will fall back, conveniently lining up for you to defeat them one-by-one. On the other hand, running into unexplored territory means a lot of cells are quickly revealed, potentially containing lots of monsters.\n\nAnother interesting aspect is that you can have a hub land with quick access to many infinitely large lands without using teleporters, or a waypoint system. :)\nThe world of Hyperrogue consists of such hub lands, and lots of other different lands with their own kind of treasure. Each land has some unique mechanics, and plays very differently, often requiring an entirely different approach. For example, the starting land - Icy land - has heat-based mechanics, there's a land where the ground vanishes beneath your feet, and there's another (cellular automaton-based) land where the walls have a life of their own, and you have to be careful not to get trapped.\n\nThe game is being actively developed, and new lands and game modes are released with major updates: Currently, there are 37 regular and 4 hub lands, which is a lot more than the first Steam release had! Also, the (small) community is very active, and there's probably always a friendly person who will help you if you are stuck, have questions, or just want to discuss several aspects of the game. Also, the developer has been very open to suggestions, and is eager to fix reported bugs, and keep the leaderboards \"clean\" in case there are obvious cheaters. A drawback is that major updates often introduce a considerable number of bugs, but with the excellent bug fix support they usually don't persist long after being reported.\n\nThe game currently has the following modes:\n[list][*]The standard mode where you can collect treasure to unlock more lands, and attempt several quests\n[*]Collecting a certain amount of treasure unlocks the respective land in the pure tactics mode, where you can try to get highscores in individual lands w/o using items or monsters from other lands\n[*]There's a cheat mode that also gives you access to map editor tools, and lets you experiment with hyperbolic patterns. \n[*]In the random pattern mode, lands appear with unusual floor/wall patterns. This mode is not well-balanced, but it can lead to some interesting and fun situations\n[*]The Euclidean mode features Euclidean versions of the basic lands, which is interesting if you want to find out which impact the unusual geometry has on the game\n[*]You can print a sheet to create a warped paper model of a scene from the game, and there's a mode where the game simulates such a paper model (remember what I mentioned about corals, and trying to embed the hyperbolic plane in our Euclidean world?)\n[*]The shmup mode removes grid restrictions and is real-time, allowing for local coop with up to 4 players (I didn't try this mode much)\n[*]The heptagonal mode allows you to explore the world of Hyperrogue using a different grid that is a bit simpler (only heptagons), but where the hyperbolic aspect is much stronger\n[*]Collecting a lot of treasure unlocks the chaos mode, where lands are more dense and w/o walls / hub lands, leading to some interesting interactions\n[*]For very ambitious players who manage to clear the Orb of Yendor or Prince(ss) quest, there are related quest modes. Especially the OoY challenge mode is noteworthy![/list]\n\nThe soundtrack is released under a Creative Commons license, and the game comes with the source code, in case you care about that.\n\nIf you're unsure about buying:\nYou can download a slightly older, free version of the game (along with the source code) from the developer's homepage, which should give you a good impression what the game has to offer. However, don't forget that it neither has leaderboards, nor Steam achievements, which are IMhO important aspects of the playing experience. The price is IMO far below the game's worth, but that's a very subjective point; still, I think the price has always been very fair given how unique the game is, and how well it is supported.", "timestamp_created": 1459443553, "timestamp_updated": 1459669547, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.697535", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21963581": {"recommendationid": "21963581", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040884867", "num_games_owned": 1255, "num_reviews": 650, "playtime_forever": 934, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488680779}, "language": "english", "review": "[b][i]HyperRogue[/i] is one of the more innovative video games we've played in a long while.[/b]\n\n[b]For fans of more traditional roguelike games, [i]HyperRogue[/i] is sure to exceed expectations, especially for its way-too-low asking price.[/b] With that being said, I think it is important to put it out there that this isn't [i]quite[/i] a roguelike by strict definition. [b]Thats ok, because the game is freakin' excellent and bursting with fresh ideas.[/b]\n\n[i]Where do I begin? [/i]Essentially, you are some sort of other-worldly traveler on an infinite procedural-generated map (actually, because of its crazy geometry that you can read about ad-nauseam elsewhere, its a bit more infinite LOL than maps that use traditional Euclidean-based systems). Regardless, this new geometry really adds to creating an environment that feels straight out of [i]Alice in Wonderland[/i]. The music feels this way too. \n\n[b][i]HyperRogue[/i] strays from traditional roguelike material in a few ways.[/b] There is no story. There is no leveling up. There is not really any gear or items (a few orbs, but they are mostly an after-thought as far as I am concerned). Fighting is very simple.\n\n[b]Overall this game is much more puzzle-oriented (perhaps in the same vein as chess), than anything more strategy-based in a roguelike.[/b] Don't get it twisted though - this is a welcome and fresh take on a game like this. \n\n[i]What is truly brilliant and fresh, though, is how the developer essentially creates mini-games for each biome or map world.[/i] Each biome has its own ruleset and they are all wonderfully done - definatley alot of thought and love was put into them which really pays off (no spoilers, but I mean one of them even ends up being a platformer and yet another becomes [i]Hexcells[/i] - frickin' brilliant).\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n+Such a fresh idea, I could go on and on. Its really [i]fun[/i].\n+Price is way too low. Within the first 3 days I owned this, we got over 5 hours easy with no signs of slowing. Thats fairly unheard of around here.\n+Theres local multiplayer!\n+Controller support is dodgy, but it does exist. Steam controller works well, though.\n+This game really feels like [i]Alice in Wonderland[/i] with the wonky geometry and the crazy music (which I didn't think fit, at first, but soon came to love it).\n+The artwork is simple, yet nice.

I say \"simple\" because the gameplay is straightforward; you wander various fantasy lands, picking up treasure and killing monsters. It's turn-based, in that you have as much time as you like to decide your moves; when you move, all the monsters take their turns, then you go again. There aren't any \"life points\", it's more like chess; you are not allowed to make a move that would result in a monster killing you. When you can't move any more (\"checkmate\"), the game is over. Simple, but it gets tense when the monsters start building up!\n\nThe graphics are a little simplistic, but they work well, especially given how they have to be stretched and shrunk. There is music, though no sound effects; the music is good, with a different theme for each land, though all the music uses the same set of instruments. It has a kind of faux-medieval feel that fits very well.\n\nThe key draw of the game is probably the hyperbolic geometry. This has a few effects; first, it's quite visually fascinating. Also, when you wander the lands, paths perennially open up in front of you, expanding infinitely. Of course, another effect of the geometry is that if you move away from a location, it's nearly impossible to find your way back unless you retrace your steps exactly.\n\nHyperRogue is an unusual, fascinating game. It's very easy to pick up and play for a few minutes, but it's difficult and deep enough to come back to again and again. Some of the hyperbolic lands have quite clever mechanics and layouts\u2014there's even a pattern editor to let you design your own levels. Plus, the developer is always working on updates and additions; the number of lands, for example, has greatly expanded since the game's release.

While I don't quite understand non-Euclidean geometry, you don't need to to enjoy this wonderful bit of work.\n\nWhat I like:\n-Gameplay forces you to think about your moves and the consequences\n-simple controls\n-simple but varied and pleasent soundtrack\n-diversity of lands\n-high replay value (scorebard helps out alot)\n-level editor and different modes\n-graphics are pleasent and contribute to the premise of the game\n\nWhat I didn't like: (explained below the list)\n-extremely high failure rate\n-parts of enemy behavior\n-unbalenced lands\n\nThe failure rate is perhaps a more personal issue, but I find that only one out of 10 games is sucessful enough to get into the really neat lands.  This can be frustrating and somewhat of a turn-off at times because unless you change some settings around, you are essentially doomed to restart in the same lands with the same challenges to face.  A part of this can be attributed to a part of enemy behavior that causes them to (I feel) increase spawn rates exponentally after a certain point, making the game much harder to play by increasing the number of tiles you can't go on due to enemies, driving you into a corner and thus to your death.  The only other thing I feel makes the game less is the unbalenced nature of the lands.  I like how each of the lands has different features: the ice in the Ice World melts, the falling tiles in the Land of Eternal Motion, etc.  But some lands are (I feel) easier than others.  For example, the Minefield is easy to navigate once you understand the method to \"minesweeping\" your way around, since there are no actual enemies.  However, the Jungle is very difficult due to the presence of 3 enemies, one of which is the Ivy.  I specifically focus on the Jungle because most of my games seem to end in the jungle, trapped by one enemy and 2 Ivy plants, which are everywhere and extremely hard to defeat when another is in close proximity.  \n\nDespite that huge block of text about the stuff I don't like, please understand that this is likely in my top 5 games.  I think that the concept is whimsical and has incredible replay value.  The developer is constantly changing things and implementing new mechanics that make the game much more fun to play.

The game world is seperated into multiple dozens of lands, each of which has its own ruleset, with monsters to kill and treasure to collect. The objective is to collect enough treasure to unlock additional lands, and then eventually find the Orb of Yendor to win. Winning is very difficult, in that as of writing this, fewer than 20 people on Steam have accomplished it, but when you lose, you can pretty easily look back and see the circumstances that lead you to your death.\n\nWith a few minor exceptions, combat follows the simple rule that you can attack any square adjacent to you to kill an enemy, and they can do the same to you. Navigating the world and attempting to not get surrounded are complicated enough as is.\n\nThe developer, Zeno Rogue, is very regularly throwing out new updates, including new lands, whenever he gets inspired by a novel idea. For most people, HyperRogue will not have lasting appeal. However, at its price point of $2, and its extremely high levels of novelty, you'd be doing yourself a disservice to not sit down and play with it for an hour.

It will teach you everything you need to learn. Not through dry text boxes or incomprehensible jargon, but just by letting you explore a world that obeys those rules. For that reason, I recommend this game to anyone who doesn't like maths.\n\nI also recommend it to people who do like maths, because... it's a roguelike in hyperbolic space, what more could you really want?\n\nThe enemies have easy-to-understand behaviour, all battles are decided in a single attack, and positioning matters above all else. It compares itself to Deadly Rooms of Death, which I've never played, but the fights are very puzzle-y even by roguelike standards. Positioning matters above all else, so the environments of the different worlds really come into play.\n\nIt's an interesting world to explore. No standard rooms-and-corridors dungeon here! All the Lands are bright and colourful. Some are hyperbolic twists on standard roguelike settings (the maze level, the Hell level, the cave level, etc.), others are pop-culture references (castle Camelot, the city of R'lyeh, the deserts of Arrakis), and still more are strange, brilliant ideas which I've never seen before - and many of which wouldn't work as well, or at all, in a flat Euclidean space.\n\nIf you're looking for a \"true\" roguelike, this isn't it. There's no health bar, every living thing (including the player) either dies in one hit or is invulnerable. There's no XP, and the only equipment is magical orbs whose effects are strictly temporary. The only real character progression is found in reaching new lands and orbs. There's very little sense of the character growing more powerful as you progress through the game.\n\nMy main problem is that it's too easy for a single mistake to kill you. The game will prevent you from moving into a position that would instantly get you killed, so you only lose if all your escape routes are cut off. But there's no sense of mercy, no ability to use a health potion or a scroll of teleport to escape a dangerous situation. Heck, if you're not paying attention and just click-click-clicking to run through the apparently empty caves, you might not notice the enemy until it's already Game Over. Granted it's my own fault for not paying attention in a turn-based game, but it happens.\n\nIn short, it's new, it's different, it's puzzly, it's tightly designed, it's colourful, it's mathsy, it's hard, and if you're still not sure whether you want to buy it then you can try the free demo (currently at http://www.roguetemple.com/z/hyper/download.php ).", "timestamp_created": 1429570464, "timestamp_updated": 1429570564, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.556364", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15435368": {"recommendationid": "15435368", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068144977", "num_games_owned": 411, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 438, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1457311013}, "language": "english", "review": "A simple concept, but a very challenging game to master! You will find yourself playing for hours on end, trying to improve your strategy. And all for a very low price. What more can you ask of a game?\n\nYour main aim is to gather treasures that you find scattered across the map. Each treasure you pick increases the difficulty, in the form of a larger number of monsters out to get you. You start with a set of lands, each with unique, procedurally generated obstacles, treasures and enemies. Collecting treasures unlocks more lands, monsters and challenges.\n\nThe game keeps you from dying too quickly by preventing your movement in a direction where you would be immediately killed, but it's still very easy to get cornered and surrounded, if you are not careful, more so the further you progress. The hyperbolic geometry will probably throw your brain for a loop: finding a spot you left behind may be nigh on impossible if you're not careful, and the shortest distance or the best path to avoid a monster may not be immediately obvious.

This makes it actually really unique and strangely absorbing. You basically collect loot and kill enemies on the way, trying to get a new high score. You defeat enemies by moving to their tile, there are no rpg mechanics or combat. It is actually more of a puzzle game and figuring out how to plan your next movement is quite important. At some point enemies become numerous and they change their style, some prove other challenges and new ways to defeat you. Furthermore some of the areas that you travel through have various gimmicks that spice up the game.\n\nFor 99 cents you cannot really go wrong, simply due to it's simple nature and unique take.

Esta t\u00e1ctica se basa en una previsi\u00f3n de hasta unos 5 o m\u00e1s turnos futuros, ya que lo enemigos que nos atacar\u00e1n tienen unos movimientos super previsibles.\n\nPracticamente lo unico que podemos hacer es mover a una casilla adyascente, esperar o atacar a un enemigo con nuestra espada que tengamos al lado, y que morira de un ataque, al igual que nosotros. Nuestra misi\u00f3n entonces es que ning\u00fan enemigo llegue a poder atacarnos en su turno. S\u00f3lo podremos realizar una acci\u00f3n por turno.\n\nEl juego se compone de varios mundos, creo que unos diez diferentes, y en cada uno los enemigos o los desafios ser\u00e1n diferentes. Aqu\u00ed, otra gracia del juego, es, que la intensidad de los enemigos que nos sale viene determinada por el n\u00famero de tesoros que hayamos encontrado y recogido, llegando a la m\u00e1xima intensidad con 50 tesoros recogidos, cosa dificil\u00edsima, en la que tarde o temprano y en breve se acabar\u00e1 palmando. Esta intensidad de los enemigos es propia de cada mundo, as\u00ed que cuando recojamos unos 20 o 30 tesoros en un mundo tendremos que escapar de \u00e9l para entrar a otro.\n\nNuestra misi\u00f3n es mas sencilla de lo que parece: recoger 100 tesoros de los mundos y matar 100 enemigos para desbloquear los \u00faltimos mundos, y en un mundo en concreto encontrar un orbe y hacer algo con \u00e9l que todav\u00eda no s\u00e9.\nEmpezamos siempre en el mismo mundo con otros dos desbloqueados, a los 30 tesoros recogidos se desbloquean otros tres, a los 60 tesoros otros tres, y a los 100 tesoros y 100 enemigos matados(creo)otros dos \u00faltimos.\n\nAunque esta misi\u00f3n es relativamente sencilla, la distancia entre ellos y la aleatoriedad de autogenerarse en las zonas donde no alcanza la vista har\u00e1 que siempre tengamos que amoldarnos a una t\u00e1ctica particular en los 5 o mas turnos futuros confiando bastante en la suerte para encontrar otros mundos o tesoros. Unos orbes en forma de hechizos y propios de cada mundo dar\u00e1n m\u00e1s profundidad sin perder nada en su equilibrio. \n\nLos logros consiguen darle ese sentido de competitividad necesario en los videojuegos, siendo los mas divertidos conseguir 50 tesoros en los mundos, cosa dificil.\n\nEl juego podr\u00e1 hechar para atr\u00e1s cuando se ve en las im\u00e1genes, y no garantizo en absoluto la diversi\u00f3n, pero lo veo muy testeado y equilibrado, al contrario que muchos trabajos p\u00e9simos en este factor.\n\nLo recomiendo principalmente por esa previsibilidad de varios turnos, que se traduce en una breve creatividad numerica de cara al jugador. Esta creatividad ser\u00e1 costante y fluida, llegado incluso preveer un desenlaze de varios turnos cada cinco segundos. Sin embargo, para lograr la t\u00e1ctica m\u00e1s adecuada y preveer el desenlaze m\u00e1s adecuado, debemos de pensar con m\u00e1s calma, tom\u00e1ndonos el tiempo que sea necesario.

Each of the ~10 zones feel different and completing the game is a nice challenge.\n\nBecause you can't accidentally kill yourself due to the turn order (the game stops you from moving in to such a space) you're free to speed through the easier parts of the game.

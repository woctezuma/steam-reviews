Recommended to all action/indie game fans.\n\n[h1]Gameplay Video + Review, if you'd rather watch[/h1]\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNmRS8hGWN4\n\n[h1]Review[/h1]\nIn Switchcars, you take a journey. However, in this case, the journey by the road also symbolizes the journey through time: by driving forward, you literally travel through the years. You have to go from year 1950 to 2055.\n\nIt\u2019s a curious action / roguelite game that asks you to switch cars to pass different kinds of terrain to outrun the time (and the cross-dimensional monsters that go after you). You have three car slots that you can fill with any passing car. If you press a button near a car, the car is added to your car inventory and is usable at any time by pressing that same button again. Each level consists of multiple road lanes. Those road lanes have different terrain types like air, water, railroad, forest, etc. So in the end, you have to match the car type with the lane type and do it in the most efficient way possible.\n\nThis is done in a really good way: a lot of vehicles are too fast, so unless you have godlike reaction you ought to get in lots of trouble and will be forced to switch and replace cars due to encountering tons of obstacles. However, since lane terrain types don\u2019t change that often, there\u2019s a good strategy element which makes path optimization much more important than avoiding obstacles. So even if you are as bad at action games as I am, there\u2019s still possibility for completing the game if you pick the route correctly. There are also pickups, aka consumable items that can improve your car or help your character. \n\nSome cars have special abilities like nitro boost, electrical engine, tank tracks, sled, etc. There are more than 1000 cars available, some are recolrs, but most of them feel very different indeed. Another interesting thing is that cars and landscapes depend on the in-game year. The cars do change with time, from retro-ish to futuristic, which adds a great twist to the game process and makes it much less linear. The pixel art is very polished and the cars are well drawn.\nAnother thing is your character\u2019s grappling hook: you can attach it to most passing cars or static obstacles, ensuring faster travel through the level and allowing you to get the cars that pass you by. One thing that I did not like was the controls when trying to grab the flying vehicles, like planes or helicopters, because whenever I held the \u201cup\u201d button on d-pad, the game often ignored me and went in horizontal directions towards other cars or obstacles. So it was pretty much impossible for me to grab aerial vehicles that are in the sky already.\n\nAnother thing that left a bitter aftertaste was the impossibility to effectively control your car at higher speeds, despite the game having very responsive controls. The speed was just too much to understand what was going on the screen. Before you start shouting \u201cgit gud,\u201d I have to say that maneuvering through the lanes happen almost instantly, but you still need a godly reaction to notice all the small details. So in the game, despite having big speeds, there are very few moments when you get to enjoy these. Perhaps the game could use some sort of a slow-mo bonus that would allow the player to slow the time down without loosing a feeling of speed. Another solution would be making cars a bit more durable, since a lot of the fast ones can\u2019t survive a head-on crash with another one.\n\nBut to sum it up, all of this seemed like a very minor drawbacks to otherwise a great game. SwitchCars is an amazing example of an indie roguelite game that creates a spectacular product on top of an original idea.

Essentially, what you the buyer needs to know is whether or not you can live with two types of gameplay as of the moment of writing, or wait for a better chance down the line where the game may (or may not) have more to offer for you. \n\nThe gameplay concept is a basic one at first glance, but there is meat to it. Just don't expect massive lists of controls; you enter vehicles, you exit vehicles, you install and use powerups, and move. That's about it. The reason why this works so well is because there isn't a single run you will make that feels the same as a previous one. The vehicle variety is enough to distinguish countless eras and classes of vehicles, the powerups add plenty of possible variations to said vehicle variety. Want to see if you can move a gun turret? That's possible. Do you think a train would work better with a rocket thruster? Have at it. Finding these combinations of vehicles and powerups is a part of what makes this game fun, the rest being made of the adrenaline which comes from running away from aliens with a limited time frame. \n\nNeedless to say, this game isn't without its issues. The main one is that while there are two types of game modes, there aren't fleshed out yet; the Run and Hardcore modes are only different in difficulty and session length, and the Free Run mode still lacks the flexibility of a proper sandbox mode. This means that if you play the game for long periods of time, you may get bored easily if you are looking for mode variety and not things to do within said modes. And if you dislike grid-based games, you are not going to like this one, because the grid-based movement is key to how the game is played. But as I said before, no one knows what will be done to this game in terms of future additions. Things like Steam Achievements have been teased, so they are a plausible possibility, and other things like resolution support are available, albeit in Beta format. \n\nFor me, this game never gets boring because of the powerups and the vehicle variety which is currently offered. But if you love to have countless game modes and hunt for achivements, the game doesn't quite offer that just yet. If you love fresh concepts and pixel game hommages, give this one a go, certainly...

[/b]\n\n[h1] Description of gameplay [/h1]\n\n[i] Switchcars [/i] is something along the lines of an endless runner games, like [i] Canabalt [/i] and [i] Vector, [/i] but with cars. Lots of cars. And boats. And planes. And really any form of transportation, along with hostile aliens trying to stop you. Also, instead of obstacles you have to jump over or slide under, you have different lanes that require ther own category of vehicles (i.e. boats need to be in water, cars need to be on roads, planes are best flying in the sky), along with obstacles that lie in your path that you need to avoid. You can pick up any car or vehicle you find on the road and store it as one of 3 vehicles you can choose, meaning keeping different vehicles for varying terrains is advantageous, or keeping multiples of the same vehicle so you don't have to stop and pick a new one when you run out of gas and can't refuel. Most vehicles have a unique ability that you can take advantage of {i.e. tow trucks have hooks to pull themselves forward faster, police vehicles have sirens that can stop or slow down other vehicles, and military vehicles have gun and cannons to destroy objects in their path). You can collect and hold up to three powerups, with a huge variety of effects, like vehicle alteration powerups such as installing electric motors, wings, or cannons on your vehicle; instant powerups, such as refuels and cool downs for abilities; and cosmetic powerups, such as car washes and paint jobs. All this leads to gameplay that requires fast-paced navigation and decision making to ensure that you keep going at the best rate possible. \n\n[h1] Value and Replay Value [/h1] \n\nThis is a game that just keeps going. There is a viable ending, but the journey and the fun of it has been so intense that I can't help but want to start over, and just keep trying. And, as I mentioned earlier, they're still releasing updates, meaning new reasons on a near-weekly basis to come back and try the game again. Right now, at it's current pricetag, you're getting a game with a lot of potential. There are bugs, which is expected of any Early Access game, but they get fixed often. There's also something left to be desired once you play the game for the while, but it's almost guaranteed to be added in the future, whatever it may be. The developer is listening to the community, and is adding in little details based on the communities interest all the time. It's a good thing they've got going for them, and I don't think they're going to mess it up. \n\n[h1] The Essential Details [/h1]\n\n[u] [b] Positives [/b] [/u]\n[list]\n    [*] Fresh experience\n    [*] Gameplay is consistent\n    [*] While being consistent, there's a lot of variety\n    [*] Developer is actively changing/creating the game\n    [*] Decent price\n[/list]\n\n[u] [b] Negatives [/b] [/u]\n[list]\n    [*] Number of bugs, though typically unnoticeable\n    [*] Small development team (takes more time for bugs to be fixed)\n    [*] Still \"incomplete\" (playing often may be boring)\n[/list]\n\n\n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\n\n[i] Switchcars [/i] is a very fun game that is still changing and growing, and so far in the best ways.

It never mattered what type of vehicle it was as long as I could feel the fresh breeze against my face and the tranquility of driving along a deserted highway. Unfortunately for the protagonist in Altfuture's Switchcars, he does not have time to observe the scenery. Every second counts in the race to 2055 and he has to use whatever vehicle he can get his hands on to reach it. Does the simple, but hard to master gameplay help this game set a new record or does it slow down enough to miss the finish line?\n\nDriving against the flow of time and the creatures that look a lot like langoliers is unique for a genre usually trapped in a dungeon setting. The visuals, however, are the same retro Super Nintendo graphics that have been trending as of late. This is a considerable negative most of the time, but the developer has taken the time to give each biosphere the right amount of detail to make them really stand out. Most of the vehicles found in the game also have a defining look which I thought would be hard to pull off in such a limited, pixelated style. Upgrades also change  the look of the car with new tires, frame attachments and paint jobs. It fits strangely enough and allows everything to stand out amidst the total chaos of constantly switching from vehicle to vehicle at top speeds (against incoming traffic).\n\nThe main focus of this game is combat though, more specifically the fight to stay out of combat. The only way to do so is by rushing through the ten stages during each run and reach the safe zone using your grappling hook while on foot and avoid incoming clutter such as houses and incoming vehicles. You have a wide range to use that each have a strength or weakness to traits such as speed and armor/ resistance or terrain (treads work better in desert, trains on tracks). With nine lanes (six ground mixed with land and sea, three air) and an ever changing biosphere, using the right vehicle is always a concern, so thankfully you can have a reserve of three to constantly switch to on the fly. This is where the mastery comes into play and while it can be more luck based than skill, identifying and utilizing specific upgrades to compensate for weakness can be enough to overcome this factor. Once the clock reaches zero, the giant whale-like worms enter the picture and will not stop trying to squish you until you manage to get to the next stage. Time is always counting down, so keep driving to the right and adapt to the environment.\n\nUnfortunately, this one trick pony can get extremely repetitive quickly and grind more on the nerves of the player than the gears of the vehicles. It can be very addicting in the beginning, but after a couple of hours this addictive high slowly wears off and the fight to reach the end starts to feel like a grind. More vehicles unlock, starting dates get closer to 2055, more lanes open up, but it is still the same game from the very beginning. There is no real complexity or improvement. Others might never run off the high created from the start, but in the end the game never evolves or offers anything other than what is introduced initially. \n\nSome other issues are still relevant with the game, but it is important to mention a lot of general bugs were already dealt with. What remains are some resolution errors that create a black screen display while in full screen and start up issues. Crashes do occur as well, but not as frequent before. Screen tearing can happen (most likely due to the speed of which environments are passing by). Frame rate drops did pop up in place of the screen tearing as well. Just something to keep in mind. \n\nThe game is in no way a negative experience and presents a unique idea into a overused genre. Endless runners and rogue likes are too numerous to address properly and generally fall flat on entry. What some of these other games tend to do, however, is evolve over the course of the playtime in order to overcome the challenges. This adventure is trapped on the same rail from start to finish. It is a shame to say this when the game has such a quirky premise, but at the current point this game just is not worth a recommendation.

It's only in Early Access, and it could definitely grow to be an even better game\n4. Brimming with sheer, unbridled joy at the hilarious inanity of it all\n\nCONS\n1. Tutorial really doesn't describe much. You're just given the keys to the car and told to go\n2. Some of the powerups seemed really useless\n3. Still a bit buggy, but again, it's in Early Access as I write this review, so it'll likely improve\n4. Even though levels are proceduraly generated, there isn't that much in-game variability, so replay value is fairly low. This makes makes any cost above five bucks for this game seem a little pricey\n\nOverall, a fun game that's perfect for killing those small blocks of time you weren't sure what to do with anyway. With a few more refinements, and maybe a few more bizarre alien creatures to flee, this game could really be awesome. If you have a few bucks and some time to kill, this game is a great option.\n\n8/10 Explosions", "timestamp_created": 1461035549, "timestamp_updated": 1472874009, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "22499467": {"recommendationid": "22499467", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023665266", "num_games_owned": 708, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 277, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468429903}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "\u00d3timo jogo, nem parece early access, quase nenhum bug ou erro que precise de fix, tem uma variedade gigantesca de carros, itens, mapas e anos j\u00e1 adicionados, uma gameplay emocionante, gr\u00e1ficos muito bonitos e bem feitos e uma capacidade de ser \"re-jogado\" enorme.\n\n\u00c9 um \u00f3timo passatempo, at\u00e9 agora os \u00fanicos dois problemas que encontrei foram a falta de op\u00e7\u00f5es para mudar a resolu\u00e7\u00e3o do jogo (s\u00f3 se pode alternar o aspect ratio) e diminuir o volume.", "timestamp_created": 1460991314, "timestamp_updated": 1460991314, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505734", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "22425828": {"recommendationid": "22425828", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042225625", "num_games_owned": 3815, "num_reviews": 297, "playtime_forever": 108, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476190815}, "language": "russian", "review": "(eng) (\u0440\u0443\u0441)\nThis is a pretty sweet variation in an old gaming genre where you have to dodge obstacles switching lanes on a highway.

We can hijack every one of them in a blink of an eye like in GTA. You get a magic inventory for 3 cars which you can instantly materialize with a hotkey any time you find a proper roadway.

Before I start this review I must say I did get this game in a bundle for a very cheap price, but what I will say is that it is not worth the 9$ price tag on the store page. Let's get on with the review...\n\nGRAPHICS\nAs you can see from the screenshots on the store page, this game has pixelated graphics and well while it doesn't totally look like some nostalgic atmoshperic experience (and it isn't), the game won't want to make you gorge your eyes out. The vehicles in the game though look like a template with some different colors. I must say though the alien really surprised me when I first saw it, in a good way. This hunkering beast made me feel rushed and slightly scared to be honest.\nSCORE 7/10\n\nGAMEPLAY\nThe greatest aspect of this game. You start of the game at 1950 and try to get to the year 2055 while traveling in cars, boats, planes, and motorcycles. You travel in time by moving forward and advancing the years. Don't worry if you die though it only sets you back a few years when you start again. Sadly this gameplay gets quite repetitive and you wont be playing this game for that long of a time, but a very good experience it is.\nSCORE 9/10\n\nREPLAY VALUE\nAs stated above this game is quite repetitive and you will spend on average anywhere from 2-6 hours playing this game, but you might get addicted somehow or you might just hate it. Overall though it's quite a good value for an Early Acess game, with barely any bugs. Honestly feels like a full indie game.\nSCORE 8/10\n\nSTORY\nNot much of one. In the year 2055 alien worms attack, and you somehow go back in time. Now you have to run away back to 2055 to escape these aliens and be safe forever.\nSCORE N/A\n\nVERDICT\nIn the end, Switchcars is a very great indie arcade game, that brings out something new to the runner genre. By the way this game is still in Early Acess, so new updates of bug fixes and new vehicles will come. For 9$ though, it offers quite little replay value and content, and the graphics aren't that prominent if that is what you came for with this indie game.\n\nTL;DR\n+Nice runner action\n+New and fun concept\n+Alien looks kinda cool\n+Wide array of vehicles\n~2-6 Hours of gameplay\n-Visuals don't stand out\n-Low replay value \n-Graphics in general look weak \nSCORE 8/10\n", "timestamp_created": 1460154362, "timestamp_updated": 1460154362, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497070", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "22272391": {"recommendationid": "22272391", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035448316", "num_games_owned": 134, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 8, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1459963634}, "language": "english", "review": "sucky game NES style gameplay this goes way back in time being so basic.

I love the randomly generated biomes and the random mixes that can happen, although sometimes it's quite frustrating to not have an appropriate vehicle for the biome, it is a lot of fun to try and beat the clock with what you have.\n- Really unique concept. I have never played a game that is in the same genre as this one. It's fast paced, brutal difficulty, and the art style is beautiful.\n\nCons\n- Issues with fullscreen mode and windowed mode. Sometimes game forgets that you want to play in window mode and it loads up fullscreen thus messing up the window sizes of all other open applications\n- Progression is a bit confusing.

Over the course of the next week I watched a few let's plays which looked better and better, and saw how active the dev is with answering questions - you can see the guy's passion for this game, and he alludes to some really cool future features.\n\nRealizing this is early access, I am having a TON of fun with this game.  After splattering my head a number of times during the first hour, I find the game is pretty easy to learn.  Once you understand the controls it's a matter of experimenting with the mechanics to optimize your game play, but I feel like mastering this game still takes long enough to keep you coming back.\n\nThe first few games I played I either died immediately (either splattering my head on a car/bus/plane/house, or jumping out of a car and getting run over on a racetrack) but after ~5 hours of playing I can regularly get to stage 7/8.  The unlocking system is really cool as the more challenging terrains only unlock once you get past a certain stage - the first time I was in the space stage it was pretty nuts, and the alien world where you can spawn 4 aliens if you don't have a car are hilarious.\n\nEven death can be funny as most games don't last more than 10 minutes, which I think makes this a rogue-like for people who don't normally like perma death.  You also have a graphical tally of all the cars you've used that run which is really fun to watch for some reason.  Each car you enter gets entered into a database which for completionists like me is great - with over 1000 cars I'm at 400 so far and loving it!\n\nOne of the best things about this game though, is of course the cars!  You can store 3 cars to be swapped between at any time, and can always ditch a saved car for a new one.  The variety is staggering, and the small details in the pixel art is amazing (drive through a muddy level and your vehicle will get mud on it, that will slowly clean off as your drive away).  One of my early games I drove through a battlefield and got 3 different tanks, which I used to get stage 7, swapping when running out of fuel and blasting everything out of my way, including killing 6 or so aliens - very satisfying!  \n\nWhen not in a car, you have the ability to run around on foot with a permanent grappling hook which you can use to catapult yourself forward dodging the object as you approach, drag yourself closer to a vehicle to hop into it (several initial runs will be lost when learning how to enter the car as you as speeding towards it).  Most of the time you'll only be in the \"on foot\" stage for a split second as the swap cars.\n\nScattered throughout the levels are powerups which range from cosmetic to amazing.  Repair all/ refuel all are fairly common (and highly useful), but there is something very satisfying with turning a battleship armed with rockets into an offroad vehicle, arm a sports car with a tank's cannon.  Because each object has a mass of their own, the lighter vehicles smash into pieces when hitting a heavy object/vehicle, but the big heavy vehicles can plow through almost anything.  The battleship mentioned above eventually was given nitrous (replacing the rockets - doh!) and smashed through EVERYTHING it ran into.  One of my first wow moments was finding and entering a stationary WW2 cannon, storing it for use when aliens showed up and swapping to it to blast them to pieces, eventually adding a fuel engine powerup so I can drive it.\n\nTo sum it up, this game is very very promising for early access.

The catch is, you have to do this all while avoding a giant green alien caterpillar that moves with the gracefulness of a potato and trying not to splatter yourself on cars and rocks along the way.\n\nThis game has no mouse support but it has no need for it.  It uses \"classic arcade and arrow key\" control scheme [b](I rebound all the keys myself out of preference)[/b].  In the game you will use three keys to \"capture\" and control cars that you can switch to on command and are interchangable for any other vehicle you find [b](So far over 1000)[/b].  Oh, and did I mention that your character has a freaking grapling hook?!\n\nThe graphics in this game are really well drawn pixel graphics but the best part is the content.  The game has over a thousand different vehicles each with seperate speed, mass, abilities, and other attributes.  There are also many different lane types (road, water, lava, etc.), each with different attributes that affect vehicles, you, and the giant alien d*ck chasing you [spoiler](you can think about it as a caterpillar if that makes you feel better)[/spoiler].  There are also powerups that you find on the ground that do anything from adding propulsion systems (tracks, rockets, etc.) to pimping out your vehicle.\n\nThe author released it in Alpha on Steam Early Access with a couple bugs here and there, but a little over a week after they released a fix for some of the bugs.  This is how Early Access was meant to be, no abandonware here.\n\nOver all, this game is very much worth the cheap price and has a ton of replayability.\n\n\n[h1]Quick

Like any responsible person I spent that money on steam. I bought 3 games, two of which I returned, the third I've been playing every day since i bought it.\n\nSwitchcars is the third game. It drew me in with it's art style and 'gimmick'. Said gimmick is switching vehicles at breakneck speed to adapt to your current terrain which changes every few seconds or so. Your goal is to travel from 1950 to 2055. Simple no? You'll be going much faster than 88 miles per hour though. The game gives you over 1000 vehicles to achieve this goal. Ranging from a rocket so fast that I just crashed it into an asteroid to...a shopping cart with no engine.\n\nSaid shopping cart can be given an engine though through 1 of 41 powerups you find on your journey. Things like drills and rocket thrusters can adorn your vehicle as you hurtle forward through time. Of course you can't get to 2055 in one tricked out shopping cart. \n\nYou have three vehicle slots which you can store vehicles in for a rainy day. A good variety of vehicles is necessary. Sure three supersonic planes sounds good and fast but they don't have that much fuel and are about as useful as...well a shopping cart when that fuel runs. Three solar powered race cars might be smarter but they wont be very good in an underground cave...full of lava. The three slots add a lot of on the spot thinking to the game which helps make the experiance engaging.\n\nI do have a few gripes. It is very easy to feel cheated when your last car brakes down on a rocky field where nothing drives and a space worm is doing a full body tapdance on you. It can also be easy to lose track of what you've driven before which makes completion a bit trickier. However the dev is very active in the forums addressing suggestions and problems quickly and politely.\n\nI personally reccomend Switchcars for one of those games you play for an hour or so every day. I would say to atleast wait for one major update to fix some of the bigger problems like resouloution and audio control but other than that I liked it. So go on, its a bit of fun for a relatively cheap price.", "timestamp_created": 1457629569, "timestamp_updated": 1457629666, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499940", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "21745518": {"recommendationid": "21745518", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044883386", "num_games_owned": 336, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 83, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1457787658}, "language": "english", "review": "[b]This review may be read in full below or you can view the review with glorious formatting and pictures in the Early Evaluation originally posted on [url=http://voxludicus.com/2016/03/10/living-life-a-quarter-mile-at-a-time/]Vox Ludicus - Living life a quarter mile at a time[/url] [/b]\n\nA couple days ago, the people over at the Humble Bundle finally dropped their monthly bundle. There were a few standout games that caught my eye but i will be honest, Switchcars was not one of those games. However, once I decided to load up this \u2018vehicular rogue-like\u2019 game, I was pleasantly surprised. It was like finding that elusive piece of pizza that had been sitting at the back of the fridge for days, sure I was hesitant to try it at first, but after going for it, I was glad I did.\n\n\u2018Switchcars\u2019 was developed by Slobodan Stevic, originally a 3d artist who worked on several games in the industry including, but not limited to, Space Engineers and Infinity: Battlescape. This experience is immediately evident as Switchcars boasts some impressive graphical details. The pixel art is distinct and colorful and your vehicle can get coated in mud and slime. The alien worm antagonist stands out vividly, with its bright green exterior and its hulking frame. One nitpick would be that the resolution seems to be currently locked at 1200\u00d7800, and as a result this leads to black bars on the screen when using a high resolution monitor.\n\nWhat is the goal of Switchcars? It is simple, you need to travel from the 1950s to the 2050s whilst at the same time trying to avoid becoming dinner for a tenacious and pissed off Alien worm. To achieve this, you have to constantly switch between vehicles. The game also features 9 different lanes. This may seem straightforward until you realize that the terrain also changes at set intervals during each stage. That car that you just had? Yeah it is in the river now. That is a nice train you have there, shame you are now on the road. This leads to some  intense and nail biting moments where you have to think on your feet and also have a contingency plan in place. You are able to save vehicles in 3 different slots but each vehicle can get damaged and depending on the vehicle type, will need fuel. There are 40 different power ups scattered across the 10 stages, some of these can upgrade your cars to get special abilities, like a helium balloon that allows you to take your car into the air, or a nifty turret that will destroy anything that was unlucky enough to be in your path.\n\nThe game isn\u2019t limited to just vehicular play. You can also roam around on foot and traverse the area with the help of a special grappling hook, although you have utilize this tool attentively or you may find yourself as road kill for the oncoming traffic. It was at these moments that I feel like a 2-bit Rico Rodriguez, grappling from car-to-car, furiously trying to get to the \u2018safe zones\u2019 at the end of each stage.\n\nThe game has a variety of different vehicles to fool around with. Currently there are 1,047 different vehicles you can utilize in your bid to escape the aforementioned hungry alien worm. There are also 101 different types of terrains, this leads to the need for constant micro-managing of your 3 slots as you need to ensure that you have the different types of vehicle, be it a plane or a bike or even a train, to survive the game\u2019s ever changing terrain. I have yet to master these tools and ascend to stage 10,but unlike Sisyphus, the rock shall one day stay atop the mountain and I will reach stage 10!\n\nIt must also be noted that the game does have a few problems. Apart from the resolution issue, there is also no way to turn down the game\u2019s sound. Only an option to turn on or off. Although I am sure the developer is aware and working on this. The game can also get quite repetitive once you have mastered the initial mechanics. This can get frustrating for players looking for more depth in the game. However, as the game is still in early access, the developer still has time to address these issues. Currently it is very fun is bite-sized chunks.\n\nOverall, just like in the game, there is still a long road for the developer to traverse. So far, the charm and fun that can be had from these short \u2018runs\u2019 through the game have been well worth my time. This game has only been released in early access on steam so I am sure there will be future updates that address some of the issues and improve upon the game play. So far it has been a fun and chaotic romp through the game\u2019s stages.

However, vehicles either break down or run out of fuel very quickly, forcing you to find more vehicles to use in the many different terrains that you cross, in which some have dozens upon dozens of vehicles to use, and others have maybe 4 or 5. When the time runs out, an alien (or aliens) will appear and try to kill you. There are terrains that limit the alien's abilities, but for the most part, the alien(s) will be able to destroy any vehicle you have, forcing you to scramble towards the next safe zone on foot. You can also die if you are on foot and either have a vehicle hit you or if you use your grappling hook and hit the object you were grappling to too hard.\n\nPros:\n-Easy to learn how to play/easy to play\n-Nice graphics\n-Fun\n-Many, many vehicles to use\n-The more you play, the more years you unlock (the later in time you start in, the easier it will be)\n-Many different terrains\n-Challenging\n-Upgrades that you can use to make your vehicles awesome\n-Technology gets better over time\n\nCons:\n-No settings to adjust how loud/quiet the audio (the only audio setting is the option to turn music on/off)\n-No way of keeping any of your vehicles for more than about 15 seconds at the most, which kind of defeats the purpose of upgrading your cars\n-Way too easy to kill yourself by grappling into something too hard\n-Gets pretty repetitive after a while\n-Having alien lands attracting aliens even before the time runs out is way too hard. Many times I've been in the 2040's or higher and suddenly I'll have 2-3 aliens chasing me. One time I even had 4 aliens chasing me in stage 1. Once there's 3 aliens, the game becomes pretty much impossible because of the fact that you need to constantly change cars, but any vehicle that you try to get in becomes almost instantly destroyed and if you try to just run to the safe zone you'll get hit so many times that you die in about 5 seconds.", "timestamp_created": 1457461634, "timestamp_updated": 1512432614, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.559159", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "21713045": {"recommendationid": "21713045", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028926033", "num_games_owned": 77, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 138, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511387771}, "language": "hungarian", "review": "Hungarian review:\n\nA j\u00e1t\u00e9k hatalmas po\u00e9n, aki l\u00e1tta a Langolierek c\u00edm\u0171 filmet az nagyj\u00e1b\u00f3l v\u00e1gja, hogy mi fog t\u00f6rt\u00e9nni, ha kifutsz az id\u0151b\u0151l :D\nGyakorlatilag olyan mint a JOJO, csak akkor \u00e9lvezed igaz\u00e1n, ha el\u00e9gg\u00e9 gyakorolott vagy az ir\u00e1ny\u00edt\u00e1sban.

Luckly you get three slots to bank your vehicles and some of the vehicles themselves have abilities, and if thats not enough there is also power ups which you can pick up and use, by using the power ups it will upgrade the current vehicle.\n\nSwitchcars will be throwing you through many different terrains to traverse over, giving vehicles advantages and disadvantages.\n\nWhile running for your life you have been given a small timer, to give you a headstart to run as far as you can before the overly sized alien belly flops into your screen towards you. As you are making your way, dodging pass hazards and changing lanes for the safe zone, tension builds as you suddenly end up being chased by the overly sized alien, trying your best to get away from it at exhilarating speed, it always manage to get closer, destroying your vehicles and hindering you, until you are dead. \n\nThe game just gets your blood pumping with a big fat smile to go with it. Now you do have a goal and it is to reach year 2055, as you get near to your goal more and more aliens will show up but what could be waiting for you in 2055? Well that is for you to find out.\n\n[h1] My Experience [/h1]\n\nThis game has a lot of unlockables which is great, it adds lots of content for a small game and many possiblity to the outcome of your escape or death which is more than other simple running games I have seen.\n\nI had tons of fun playing it but I did find the controls confusing at first, getting my button presses muddle up since you have to be in human form in order to take cars into the slot of your choice. \n\nNow I don't know whether its because of the graphic or simply because I am going blind but going at super sonic speed in this game just messed up my eyes, it was really hard to see but I was having so much fun I didn't let it ruin my fun.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMi85WK2UsY", "timestamp_created": 1457458416, "timestamp_updated": 1457458618, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.612850", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "21709546": {"recommendationid": "21709546", "author": {"steamid": "76561197962106720", "num_games_owned": 295, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1460, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1461282872}, "language": "english", "review": "Recently obtaining this game in a bundle, and playing it for a few hours the other night, I can definitely say I am impressed.  \n\nThe game does a some things really well, for instance, the pace of the game is fast and suspenseful, there are a myriad of vehicles, and the idea is fresh and unique.

Keep that in mind, but the game isn't perfect, it just needs a bit of polish.

Just running in a game based on speed feels arduous if you are mid-game, as you progress, you really dread those types of situations.\n\nGoing to keep it short, but, I really enjoy this game, it has a lot of replay as no two runs are the same.

This time I ignored the prompt to use the grapple hook and managed to jump into a car and start driving... The feeling of not needing to change directions and only go to the right was oddly pleasing. But then I realised the challenge of trying to keep ahead of the time limit before some obese alien worm decided to attempt to squash me into a pulp. I also realised that to achieve this, I had to engage with the changing environment and locate and switch to the vehicle best suited for the environment. \nThis is a game you'll pick up and be able to jump straight into, but also a game which involves some skill at being able to make quick decisions and assess... Do I change my helicopter for that boat with the mounted machine gun? Or do I keep flying away and escape the evil psychotic worm that refuses to be my friend?\nIt's also a game where you will make poor decisions and learn from them. Don't accidently waste nitrous on your bicycle and smash it into a lorry... \nWill you spend thousands of hours playing this game and never leave your room for days? Very unlikely...\nWill you enjoy spending 15-20 minutes at a time in an entertaining and satisfying manner? YES.\nI'd say that even if I had purchased this game independently, I would have felt that it was a good investment. \n9/10 - Would grapple into an oncoming vehicle again.

I keep coming back, hoping to get that 'aha' moment where I'm utterly hooked, but that isn't quite happening yet.\n\n[i]Essentially, you are near-endlessly running from a giant green worm.[/i] There is no storyline, which might help in this case. You have a countdown timer until the worm shows up. Until then, you are literally just moving left to right by the fastest means possible. You can keep three vehicles in your 'inventory' to seemlessly switch between. There are powerups/upgrades, but nothing feels too permanent because vehicles come and go out of your inventory fast.

Yes they can feel different, but the spectrum is only so big. Fast cars are generally delicate, and slow cars are more tank-ish. Vehicles also vary by terrain (ie. water versus air, etc.).\n-While the big worm can be killed, its generally the end of the run when it shows up (or at least your seconds are numbered).\n\n[b]The price is cheap, but I am very leary to recommend this game - its definately fresh, but also it is debatable how much fun you will get out of it.[/b] From talking on the forums, very few people really get alot of mileage out of it so far.", "timestamp_created": 1457278636, "timestamp_updated": 1457279003, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.614737", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "21665646": {"recommendationid": "21665646", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989999697", "num_games_owned": 1079, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 247, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1461171944}, "language": "english", "review": "You hop into a vehicle, ride into the future, and try not to get caught by worm-like aliens.

It's super fast paced and includes giant green space carp worms? Anyway, it's definitely worth checking out.\n\nThe player starts out as some dude just running around and, as quickly as possible, you'll jack a nearby vehicle to start moving right. The really interesting mechanic is how the map changes as you move. If you move far enough you'll pass through time rifts. These bring you to a new map with a different theme and different vehicles. Different terrain effects vehicles and the real skill is in knowing how to switch between vehicles smoothly.\n\nThere's also the grappling hook. Quite frankly, that thing has it out for me. I've been killed more time by high speed collisions due to grappling hook accidents (I'm looking at you hot air balloon) than anything else. With a higher degee of skill however (or maybe just some skill), it can be a powerful tool to move you forward much quicker when you're on foot.\n\nIf you take too long between safe points, giant green carp with teeth descend from the sky to wreak havoc upon your tiny, unprepared body. You just have to hope that yuou can evade the beast long enough to get to the next safe zone.\n\nThe controls are very tight and each type of vehicle has its strengths and flaws.

Check. Hundreds of vehicles to use in your escape? Check. Loads of stuff to keep you interested? Eh. [/h1]\n\nSwitchcars is a vehicular rogue-like that feels a bit like a not-so-endless runner game. You begin as early as the 1950s (by default you start in the 80s), your goal is to drive your way to the 2050s while running away from what is best described as a giant, green killer whale. After three hours of playing what are generally five minute runs, I\u2019m nowhere near beating the game but I\u2019m also nowhere near giving up. Switchcars is pretty simple, because of this, you\u2019re either going to like the game or hate it.\n\nFull Disclosure: A review copy was provided by the developer.\n\nThe idea of being a tiny little human running away from a giant alien is a daunting one. Thankfully, Switchcars gives you just enough help to make this task possible, even if it is incredibly difficult. For the most part, you won\u2019t even find yourself dead at the hands of the alien, you\u2019ll find yourself splattered on one end of a high speed train or car. That\u2019s what Switchcars really comes down to, switching between different vehicles. \n\nYou can store up to three vehicles (that includes whatever you\u2019re using) so providing you\u2019re able to keep three good vehicles on you and you don\u2019t crash too often then it\u2019s actually quite easy to stay far enough ahead of the alien to reach safe zones (placed at the end of each one of ten stages a run consists of) with ease. Sadly that only happens in an ideal world, one filled with vehicles that are all super awesome.\n\nThe game currently has one thousand vehicles in it spread out across the years, many of them with names. Ranging from tractors to racing cars, paragliders to jets and canoes to submarines. Of course, not all of these vehicles are as fast as a race car, or as armoured as a tank and so you\u2019ll often have to make do with something slower or weaker. These are the really challenging parts of the game, the parts where you\u2019ll need to quickly switch between vehicles in order to keep going and stay ahead of the alien. \n\nEvery vehicle has a fuel and health bar and some vehicles also have abilities. Fuel is obviously drained by simply using the vehicle but there are refuelling points along the way, as well as repair points. The health bar of a vehicle is drained by, you guessed it, damaging the vehicle which happens when you crash into something or drive into lava, that kind of thing. For the most part, a vehicle\u2019s ability is just a horn (or siren for emergency vehicles), it\u2019s the more specialised vehicles that have the \u2018cool\u2019 abilities, like fighter jets with missile launchers or submarines with the ability to go underwater. Offensive abilities can be used to blow up obstacles in your path and even kill the alien chasing you (not sure what effect that has on a run since I haven\u2019t pulled this off yet.)\n\nSpeaking of paths, Switchcars has nine different lanes for you to drive, fly, or swim through. Six of these lanes are ground lanes, ranging from grassland to water canals to train tracks and the other three are for airborne vehicles. Airborne vehicles can travel along ground lanes too but generally there\u2019s more traffic, and therefore more to crash into, down there. There are a hell of a lot of different lane types and most of the vehicles are only suited to one or two different types of lane so you\u2019ll need to change up your vehicle roster accordingly when you enter a new area with new lanes. \n\nNow, though it does sound like it\u2019s all about the vehicles, you\u2019re actually able to get around on foot rather well thanks to a grappling hook. It\u2019s pretty effective at pulling you towards stationary objects and speeding you up but it\u2019s most effective when you pull yourself towards something going incredibly fast, such as a race car. Not only will you be able to catch up to a vehicle you otherwise wouldn\u2019t have been able to, it\u2019ll also pull you through the level a helluva lot quicker than you would have been going, even if you were in the vehicle you\u2019re after. \n\nBefore I move on to the negatives, I\u2019ll quickly mention powerups, of which there are forty in the game. The powerups are dotted throughout the levels and range from machine gun turret attachments to helium balloons that\u2019ll let you fly even the largest of cars. As long as the powerups don\u2019t conflict, i.e. you can\u2019t use two ability powerups, you can use as many of them as you want and there doesn\u2019t seem to be a limit to how many you can carry. \n\nAlthough I have been enjoying the game thus far, it certainly has its negatives, one more important than the rest. You basically see all the game has to offer in the first two minutes of gameplay. Sure, the addictive nature of the game has been enough to keep me playing for just over three hours but in its current state will I go back and play more? Probably not. There are basic unlocks, like new lanes and later starting years, but there\u2019s nothing that changes what is already a very simple game. There\u2019s just not enough here to keep the game interesting for more than a couple of hours. You can see from some of the forum discussions that the lack of complexity means some people just don\u2019t enjoy the game full stop. That may be the case for you as well, all I can say to that end is that I have enjoyed it but I do understand why others have not. It\u2019s worth remembering that Switchcars has only just released in Early Access, so there\u2019s every chance that it\u2019ll be improved to a point where there is enough complexity to keep it interesting for longer but this review is about the game\u2019s current state, not what it may become.\n\nI do have a couple of other issues with the game. The first, and hopefully soon to be fixed (this\u2019ll be updated accordingly) is the complete lack of resolution support, Switchcars only runs in 1280x800 (16:10) which means anyone with a higher resolution monitor will have big black bars at the top and bottom of the screen as well as the game being slightly stretched out. The second technical issue I have is the complete lack of options, you have a control configuration menu, a fullscreen toggle, a music toggle and a camera shake option. That\u2019s it. Taking the resolution support issue into consideration, the least I would have expected is a music and sound effect slider rather than just a toggle for music. Lastly, I did come across a few parts in a number of runs where there are no vehicles and nothing that you can use to pull yourself along with the grappling hook. This can be avoided by keeping a couple of backup vehicles of course but those may well run out of fuel or breakdown, especially as some terrain types damage vehicles (or the player if you\u2019re on foot). I didn\u2019t have this happen to me too many times but, as some people have said in the forums, these parts really slow the game down and I found myself losing the run either during these sections or shortly after.\n\n[h1]Verdict [/h1]\n\nSwitchcars may be too simplistic for some but for others it\u2019ll be an entertaining and addictive experience, perhaps not for long enough to warrant a full price purchase though. If you think the game, even with its lack of complexity, is something you\u2019ll enjoy then go for it, if not hold off for a sale or wait for it to get further along the development process to see if anything changes.\n\n[i][url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/lonerangerreviews#curation]Lone Ranger Reviews.[/url][/i]\n\nEl K.", "timestamp_created": 1457219924, "timestamp_updated": 1457219924, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 69, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.738172", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "21653013": {"recommendationid": "21653013", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062026656", "num_games_owned": 270, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 501, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511381735}, "language": "german", "review": "Wer damals Frogger gern gespielt hat wird das hier lieben.

The game looks initially simple, with a grapple hook player running on a field with the ability to instantly enter any vehicle and switch between 3 at a whim to take advantage of the different terrains on the map. The game randomly generates the course of terrain types and it's up to you to grab the most efficient vehicle for the track ahead. However, you slowly begin to peel back layers in the game that you weren't expecting. The game's timer doesn't simply end the game if you fail to reach it, it unleashes a chaotic worm beast that tries to kill you. If you grapple onto an object, it'll sling you towards it at breakneck speed (quite literally) and you must dodge or enter the object you grappled on to. Ambulances heal you while you drive, every vehicle uses fuel differently, there's powerups to change the vehicle's fuel source and terrain specility or add weapons.

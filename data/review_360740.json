Being one of the indie titles that has a android mobile release (Looking at you Crypt of the NecroDancer), it'd be worth it if it were $10.\n\n[h1] What this game does right [/h1]\n\nIt's easy to pick up and just play, no 30 minute story cutscene telling you what's going on. Just go down and shoot stuff with your gunboots, it's that simple. The movements are fluid, the shooting is spot on, and all the gun modules are balanced in my personal opinion. Once you go down to the depths of the well, it progessively gets harder with you, the player learning how things work and adapting your play style to fit that criteria.\n\n[h1] What this game doesn't do right [/h1]\n\nRemember how I said the gun modules are balanced? The upgrades aren't, in fact only a small portion of them are actually useful.\n\nFor example, knife and fork. It works progressively, yes, but more often than not you'll not touch the enemy at all or you'll try to go near it and get hit by another enemy.\n\nAlso, the game is a tad bit short. It'd be neat if the game had a looping mechanic like Nuclear Throne does. However, this is a $3, so it does have its limits though.\n\nAlso, jumping on enemies has really awkward hit detection sometimes. You can land a little bit to the left or right side and sometimes get hit.\n\n\nWould I recommend it? If you haven't seen the thumbs up, then yeah. It's a great and simple indie game I think some roguelike fans would really enjoy.", "timestamp_created": 1513213848, "timestamp_updated": 1513213848, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38289335": {"recommendationid": "38289335", "author": {"steamid": "76561198272585751", "num_games_owned": 50, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 443, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 45, "last_played": 1513884526}, "language": "english", "review": "Help I'm addicted!", "timestamp_created": 1513202749, "timestamp_updated": 1513202749, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.471014", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38253517": {"recommendationid": "38253517", "author": {"steamid": "76561198104812446", "num_games_owned": 84, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 466, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 11, "last_played": 1514091800}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5de7\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1513072680, "timestamp_updated": 1513072680, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38252945": {"recommendationid": "38252945", "author": {"steamid": "76561198275515868", "num_games_owned": 53, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 219, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470417244}, "language": "russian", "review": "5/10. \u0418\u0433\u0440\u0443\u0448\u043a\u0430 \u043d\u0430 2 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0430, \u043d\u0435 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0435. \u041f\u0440\u044b\u0433\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0432\u043d\u0438\u0437 \u0443\u0436\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0442\u043e\u043c \u043d\u0430\u0434\u043e\u0435\u0434\u0430\u0435\u0442, \u0438, \u0441\u043e\u0431\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e, \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u044b\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0443 \u0432\u0430\u0441 \u0432 \u043a\u043e\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0446\u0438\u0438...", "timestamp_created": 1513069917, "timestamp_updated": 1513069917, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38248279": {"recommendationid": "38248279", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066391581", "num_games_owned": 142, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 404, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480031148}, "language": "english", "review": "i think ive gotten a 20 combo in this game before. it makes you think about shooting in a different way- less as just an attack and more as a viable movement option. i really love it for that reason alone, but its a good game too!", "timestamp_created": 1513048099, "timestamp_updated": 1513048099, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38243257": {"recommendationid": "38243257", "author": {"steamid": "76561198345269777", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 446, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 26, "last_played": 1513350914}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Tirate a un pozo, todos te lo agradeceremos y tu tambi\u00e9n.

Tanto que creo que con el chiste de arriba practicamente resumi a que va el juego: Sos un tipo que esta felizmente pasandola bomba bajo la luz de la luna pero que, por alguna extra\u00f1a razon se le paso por la cabeza \"che, mi vida esta demasiado tranquila, a lo mejor caer a un pozo sin fondo me traeria algo de adrenalina\". \n\nAl principio todo tranquilo. Caes, te cruzas con murcielagos, tortugas, caracoles, gusanitos, eh.... cosos (?) y demas cosas que se disponen a acabar con uno, pero podes acabar tranquilamente. Dos reglas: blanco: se puede matar saltando, rojo: solo disparando. El mismo boton del salto es el de disparo. Eventualmente te encontras con cuevas (protegidas por algun tipo de escudo termporal (?)) donde pueden haber negocios o simplemente mejoras de armas o vida.\n\nPasando la primer seccion vas a poder elegir entre 3 upgrades que se van a mantener durante toda esa partida hasta que mueras, como todo buen juego con aspectos roguelike. Cada dos secciones el area cambia completamente junto a los enemigos. El juego tiene 4 areas. \u00a1Esta en vos llegar hasta el final y ver que hay!\n\n[h1]Lo Bueno[/h1]\n\n-Juego simple y adictivo. Tiene el sindrome del determinado: rejugas tanto que eventualmente avanzas mas un poquitito en cada partida.\n\n-BARATO. Y lo vale por el contenido que trae.\n\n-Salvo que dures bastante, son partidas relativamente cortas.\n\n-Aun habiendolo pasado, conseguir todos los achievements puede ser un desafio bastante entretenido si son bien cabezaduras y no se frustran.\n\n-Este punto es mas subjetivo, pero por alguna razon este juego me relaja. No se si es el ambiente retro, la musica o que...\n\n[h1]Lo Malo[/h1]\n\n-De nuevo, si no te gustan los roguelikes, te tengo una mala noticia...\n\n-Honestamente estoy pensando algo mas negativo para tirar pero no se me ocurre.

There was one time I thought \"boy I'll never even reach near the end of the game, it's pretty impossible\". Happens it isn't. I got the the final boss stage, it's hella hard, got my butt kicked to a game over, but at least I was there. A few times already. And you know how? I tried dozen times. Several. Thousands, millions, gazillion, damn, IT SUCKED. IT WAS TERRIBLE. But dunno why I kept going on, redoing the whooooole thing. Sometimes I just opened the game, was hit only once and then ragequitted. That's the thing I keep playing over and over. And prolly I'll be playing it until I reach the end.\n\nFor tl;dr, it's hard. Infuriating. But worth it.

Even after playing for just a few hours total, I would definitely go the extra mile to say that Downwell has one of the best kinds of ''Game Feel'' I have experienced thus far, where the mechanics of the game altogether work in harmony with each other.\n\nGameplay wise it draws inspiration from another popular rogue-lite platformer, Spelunky. Both in Downwell and Spelunky, you venture down into the perilous depths of the underground world, collecting valuables, finding power-ups and upgrades and defeating all sorts of critters and creatures along the way. But what differentiates Downwell from Spelunky, is that Downwell focuses more on the combat aspect, both enemy and player wise, where enemies left undefeated pose an actual challenge for the player later on, which encourages players to defeated as many enemies as effeciently as they can, so that later on they have more practical experience on each levels unique enemy types and have more gems to buy health and upgrades from shops located in set levels. \n\nWhen it comes to the presentation, Downwell excels on all aspects in my honest opinion. The game has a very clean and charming pixel artstyle with high contrasting colors helping everything pop from the levels. The game also sports a  chiptune soundtrack that is very pleasing to listen to whils't playing, because the tracks also help to create the proper atmosphere for each stage. The sound design makes every action, from shooting your gunboots to simply jumping on enemies and collecting gems, feel incredibly satisfying and rewarding.\n\nTL;DR: Just buy it.

I genuinely felt like everything I did was my fault, every little bit of damage and messing up combos. It helped train my reflexes.\n\nTo start, you'll notice the fact that there's no story. Sorta. You jump down a well, fighting frogs and turtles, bats and worms, demonic space monsters and snails. The usual. Then, suddenly, the area begins to change, and now you're fighting skulls and ghosts. Beware Child! There's bony people skeletons everywhere! Scary, right?\n\nThe upgrades are rather varied, and you will find a playstyle that suits you- for me, it was to just to go a full gem build, collect as many gems as possible and buy my way to the end. Luckily, there's an upgrade that makes it so shops appear at the start of every area, making this a valid strategy.\n\nAs you continue on, dying and dying again, you'll begin unlocking new colours and characters, and soon you'll unlock a character that will easily trump every other one. For me, it's 'boulder style', which gives you +2 max health but lowers your upgrade choice by 1. As you always got 3 upgrades to choose from, reducing it to 2 helped a lot in giving me less choice, which ironically made choice easier.\n\nThere's always a flaw, though; for me, it's the fact the final boss feels... easy. at least, on Normal Mode. On Hard Mode, You'll NEVER get to him to find out. I literally beat him 5 minutes ago, and it took me 5 minutes to beat him. I also found that getting to the final boss was easier than the area before it. Maybe that was the design choice? Who knows. To be a fly on the wall at Devolver Digital.\n\nNow, as is life, my opinion may not sway you. I really don't mind- it's your choice! However, for it's current price, I got my fun out of it within the first hour, so if a nice time waster is something you're looking for, I heartily recommend it. The achievements are balanced and possible, the colour palettes are fun to try and unlock, and the characters are willing to do anything they can to get you to use them. Overall, it's another awesome game from an awesome company!\n\n(Just don't get the mobile version. It kinda sucks.)", "timestamp_created": 1511620413, "timestamp_updated": 1511620413, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37529134": {"recommendationid": "37529134", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069353495", "num_games_owned": 84, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 77, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511471958}, "language": "french", "review": "Un jeu r\u00e9tro assez sympa, vous n'y jouerez pas 2 heures de suite mais quelques dizaines de minutes de temps en temps qui resteront amusante !

Do you want to keep your combo going to get greater prizes, or do you want to keep stopping early to maximize monetary gaines? Do you want to change your weapon just to get extra health, or is it not worth changing your gun? The game is inititally fun because of the gimmick of going down instead of left to right, but then the game becomes even greater once you understand all the all the little decisions that can fit in the span of split seconds or impact the rest of your run.\nBesides the clever execution, the game is just hard; plain and simple. It's like a weird combination of a platformer and a bullethell; it requires fast decision-making skills and reflexes, and the hard mode you unlock after defeating the boss totally changes the game.

"Downwell is a fantastically frenetic action-platformer with snappy controls, wonderful 2-bit pixel art, and a bizarrely fascinating world.\n\nCombat is quick and satisfying, and the game bundles health and ammo boosts with weapon types to encourage you to try new weapons.\n\nThe game's characters and setting are weird as heck, and I love them for that- every new area is a joy to experience for the first time.\n\nGetting to the bottom of the well is a mysterious challenge like nothing I've ever seen; there are no checkpoints, so to beat the game you have to go through every single level without dying once. That level of near-impossible-challenge intrigue is something a lot of roguelikes pass up in favor of \"rogue-lite\" mechanics, so you don't see it all too often, and it works perfectly here.\n\nIt isn't without its flaws- most of the unlockables you get through multiple runs are simple palette swaps, and there are plenty of times when not getting hit is almost impossible- but the good far outweighs the bad.\n\nHeck, I haven't even beaten it yet, but that doesn't matter: I love this game, and, if you're an action gamer with a penchant for pixel art and tough-but-fair challenges, you will too.", "timestamp_created": 1511433692, "timestamp_updated": 1511433858, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0,

Buy it.\n\nI don't like platformers, rogue-likes/lites, schmups or procedural generation, but I love this game and seems to do it really well.\n\nFirst and foremost, while the game is challenging, it is easy to jump into. This is a game I wish was on the Switch so that I can play it wherever I go. The gameplay is simple and easy to learn but hard to master. The furthest I've gotten is level 2-3 and I've died a whole lot but I still want to play more. Unlike most other games in this genre, I don't hate redoing the levels because the journey back is just so exhilarating. It embodies the term \"replayability\" in its purest form -- not for some arbitrary extra content or for completion's sake, but for the sheer amount of fun you can have while playing. \n\nThere's something about the verticality of the levels and the ability to just dash through to the next level at breakneck speed without knowing what awaits you that makes the experience very satisfying. You don't have to kill any of the enemies if you don't want to, you'd only kill them for gems that you use to buy upgrades should you choose to. A very simple, cheap and highly entertaining game with a ton of replayability.\n\nI have not experienced any of the technical issues that other people have reported. The only negative I can think of, and this is really a nitpick more than anything, is that at later levels when there are a ton of enemies swarming around you, it is difficult to tell which pixel are you or where you are. This is mostly due to the very simplistic color palettes that both your avatar and enemies use. It would have been better to use a different color scheme for the avatar to make him stand out.\n\nEDIT: I have just played the mobile version of Android and while the game itself is still great, simulated controller schemes don't feel as good as a physical controller.

Later in the game you can receive upgrades and \"Styles\" that can increase your health and affect specific variables in the game, as to increase your ability to survive and get to later stages in the game. The upgrades and styles are very neat ways of adding challenges and ways to make the game easier. There is also a \"Platette\" that allows you to change the base color and theme of the game, allowing for multiple visual styles in exchange for the original one. The randomized levels offer a neat variety of experiences, and up the replay value a lot. The game is fantastic at allowing you to just \"Jump In\" and play, as you can spend a few days without playing and then jump back in without the dangers of starting off in a tough position.  I haven't encountered any bugs/glitches and the game looks and feels very polished. I got the game on a sale, so I only spent 1.01$, but with what the content is and the inital price of 2.99$, I feel like I took something from the devs. The difficuly can occasionally be frustrating because it can feel like you arn't getting anywere, but it isn't that big of a deal. \n\ntl;dr in list form\n\n[h1]The Good[/h1]\n[list]\n  [*] Difficulty\n  [*] Randomized Upgrades \n  [*] Platette options\n  [*] Randomized Levels\n  [*] Visuals\n  [*] Ability to jump back into playing\n  [*] The Price \n[/list]\n\n[h1]The Bad[/h1]\n[list]\n  [*]The Difficulty can get annoying at times.\n  [*]The bats.", "timestamp_created": 1511139778, "timestamp_updated": 1511140792, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.681412", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36629391": {"recommendationid": "36629391", "author": {"steamid": "76561198204202029", "num_games_owned": 48, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 77, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511194073}, "language": "turkish", "review": "''Neden daha \u00f6nce al\u0131p oynamad\u0131m ki ?''

Man spielt eine junge Person, die aus Neugier in einen Brunnen im Park hinabsteigt. Und im Gegensatz zum Brunnen ist die Handlung auch nicht viel tiefer. Aber das macht nichts. [i]Downwell[/i] ist eindeutig angelehnt an eine \u00c4ra, in der Videospiele noch keine hochwertigen Geschichten erz\u00e4hlt haben, sondern man ohne Umschweife mit dem Spielen losgelegt hat.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nMit schweren Kanonen an den Stiefeln ballert man sich seinen weg hinab durch den Brunnen, der eigentlich viel zu tief und breit f\u00fcr einen normalen Brunnen ist. Hin und wieder gibt es einen Nebenraum hinter einer Zeitanomalie. Betritt man diese Anomalien, bleibt die Zeit au\u00dferhalb stehen, sodass man diese als sichere Zonen nutzen kann. In diesen Nebenr\u00e4umen findet man entweder Edelsteine oder neue Waffen, die auch gleichzeitig die Gesundheit oder Energie verbessern.\nManchmal trifft man auch auf einen H\u00e4ndler, dem das Wort \"Standortfaktor\" anscheinend v\u00f6llig unbekannt ist, und der absolute Wucherpreise f\u00fcr seine Reisb\u00e4llchen verlangt.\n\nAm Ende eines jeden Levels kann man sich noch aus einer zuf\u00e4lligen Auswahl ein permanentes Upgrade f\u00fcr diesen Durchlauf aussuchen.\n\nHat man das Spiel ein paar Male gespielt, schaltet man zus\u00e4tzliche Spielstile frei, die die Sprites der Spielfigur beeinflussen, sowie andere Parameter des Spiels, wie zum Beisiel die Preise beim H\u00e4ndler oder die Anzahl der Upgradem\u00f6glichkeiten.\n\nDer Schwierigkeitsgrad ist angenehm schwer. Man wird so einige Versuche brauchen, bis man am Grund des Brunnen angekommen ist. Allerdings wird man hier nie frustriert, denn dazu macht es einfach zu viel Spa\u00df. Es gibt auch keine unfairen Stellen im Spiel, an denen man einfach nicht vorbeikommt und jedes Mal von vorne anfangen muss, bis man den Dreh 'raus hat. Bei [i]Downwell[/i] denkt man sich nur: \"N\u00e4chstes Mal schaffe ich es noch ein St\u00fcck weiter!\"\n\n[h1]Atmosph\u00e4re[/h1]\nDas Ganze pr\u00e4sentiert sich in einer h\u00f6chst charmanten 2bit-Grafik, die nicht nur an vergangene Zeiten erinnert, sondern auch noch funktional ist: Jede der vier Farben hat im Spiel eine Funktion, und anhand der Farben kann man erkennen, ob man auf einen Gegner draufspringen kann oder dabei Schaden erleidet, ob man auf einem Terrain sicher landen kann oder es gef\u00e4hrlich ist. Der grafische Stil hat mich auch stark an das (sehr empfehlenswerte) Flashgame [url=https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/493990][i]Down the Well[/i][/url] auf Newgrounds erinnert - was irgendwie auch sehr naheliegend klingt...\nW\u00e4hrend des Spiels schaltet man f\u00fcr gesammelte Edelsteine neue Farbpaletten frei, die die vier Farben ver\u00e4ndern. Nur eine eigene Farbpalette kann man leider nicht zusammenstellen.\n\nPassend zum Stil des Spiels gibt's was auf die Ohren von einem herrlichen Chiptunesoundtrack, der das Retrogef\u00fchl des Spiels nochmal doppelt unterstreicht.

The variety of weapons to choose (and shoot) from are both fun and challenging to master. For me, this definitely helps the game from not getting repetitive too quickly. The free upgrades you can choose at the end of every level also helps with this.\n\nCons: However, the game does suffer from poor optimization, causing black screens upon launch. And still occurs even after re-installing twice. There's also frame-lag which makes the game look a little more floaty than usual, even when running on a decent gaming laptop with 8gb of RAM. I do hope the developers release an update and fix these issues.\n\nAll-in-all I'd say it's a very fun and very challenging game with a nice, crisp 8-bit look. If you like arcade-styled, rouge-like games, you better buy this. Just hope that your PC is optimized to handle this game fully.\nAnd it's only $3, I mean, who can argue with that?", "timestamp_created": 1509147601, "timestamp_updated": 1509147701, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36048336": {"recommendationid": "36048336", "author": {"steamid": "76561198248714336", "num_games_owned": 647, "num_reviews": 108, "playtime_forever": 10, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509114465}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice graphics, very fun to play a few times.", "timestamp_created": 1509119420, "timestamp_updated": 1509119420, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36040348": {"recommendationid": "36040348", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029778807", "num_games_owned": 282, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 18, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512149265}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4e70\u4e86\u7279\u5730\u6253\u4e86\u4e00\u904d\u6838\u805a\u53d82017\u7684\u91d1\u5e01\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u771f\u7684\u592a\u96be\u4e86\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1509102967, "timestamp_updated": 1509102967, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36003719": {"recommendationid": "36003719", "author": {"steamid": "76561198326170016", "num_games_owned": 40, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 100, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508993665}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0425\u043e\u0442\u044c \u044f \u0438 \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043d\u044f\u043b, \u043f\u043e\u0447\u0435\u043c\u0443 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0442 \u043f\u0430\u0446\u0430\u043d \u0432\u0435\u0447\u043d\u043e \u043f\u0440\u044b\u0433\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0432 \u043a\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0446 \u043d\u0430\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0435\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0432\u0441\u044f\u043a\u043e\u0439 \"\u0432\u0441\u044f\u0447\u0438\u043d\u044b\",  \u043d\u043e \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0432\u0441\u0435 \u0436\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0447\u0438\u0432\u0430, \u0438 \u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0430\u044f \u0443\u0431\u0438\u0432\u0430\u043b\u043a\u0430 \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438.", "timestamp_created": 1508992194, "timestamp_updated": 1508992194, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36000777": {"recommendationid": "36000777", "author": {"steamid": "76561198325633032", "num_games_owned": 94, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 150, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508248712}, "language": "turkish", "review": "Downwell oynamas\u0131 keyifli bir oyun.

Per farlo dovremo cadere gi\u00f9, lungo questo buco quasi infinito armati di stivali-sparaproiettili per farci strada tra le creature che lo popolano. Troveremo nemici di vario genere, sconfiggibili in vari modi, che alla loro morte lasceranno \"gemme\", il credito delle partite per comprare vita/vita massima/cariche nei negozi sparsi per la mappa. Troveremo anche piccole caverne che contengono delle armi o delle gemme. Ci sono moltissime armi, dal fucile laser alla mitraglietta.\nAlla fine di ogni stage potremo scegliere un power-up, anche questi numerosi e molto utili.\nAlla nostra morte/completamento della partita il nostro punteggio del gioco aumenter\u00e0 e ogni livello ci dar\u00e0 una palette di colori per il gioco/uno \"stile\" del personaggio.

The one-line concept for both Downwell is exceedingly simple:\n\nYou're falling down a well and your only weapon is guns attached to your feet.\n\nDownwell nails what a lot of retro games miss: that the concept should be interesting enough to carry the whole game by itself. Convoluted systems and mechanics aren't necessary. The game is so fabulously simple I can explain all the mechanics you really need to know to somebody who knows nothing about video games at all right here in the review. Use the arrow keys to move left and right. Jump with spacebar. Spacebar in midair shoots your foot-guns. Colored stuff is interactable. There you go, the game is well designed enough that everything else can be trial-and-errored or even intuited the first time you encounter it in-game, and to me, that intuitivity is one of the lost arts of game design.\n\nApart from that, Downwell is very challenging. It's demands some unreal reflexes out of the player and if your reflexes are pretty blunt that might be a turn-off. Art and music are both good. If I had to pick some cons out of this game, it'd be technical stuff, such as BGM and SFX volume not having separate sliders, windowed mode not being resizable, and fullscreen alt-tabbing being pretty awful considering how light the game is.

You play as a kid with gunboots, falling and shooting down a massive well past lots of different monsters. Ghosts, floating eyeballs, turtles, things like that. The game's controls are very solid, and movement is a lot more fluid than it looks. You can bounce off of walls, smash ontop of enemies to chain combos, or just land on a ledge before moving on. And certain 'styles' allow for different runs, such as the Spinning Arm, which allows you to only find gun types (a good thing), but shops are much more rare.\n\nAnd the soundtrack is pretty great, too. Downwell's soundtrack reminded me of Hotline Miami's, (Another Devolver Digital title, may I add.) in how fresh it felt. The songs were perfect for each respective stage, and they really help make the game special.\n\nDownwell is just a really great game overall, and took me about 15 hours to 100%.

It will trick you in to thinking it's easier than it is up front by throwing you in to the game with little explanation, but utilizing simple controls and mechanics so you quickly get the hang of what's going on.  Yet as you descend, you'll find quickly that there's a very difficult game not too far down that well.  \n\nDownwell is, at its core, a shoot 'em up.  Sure it has plenty of platforming action and doesn't constantly have you moving, but the driving force is blasting away at screens of enemies with a variety of weapon pickups as you drop ever downward.  It also has some roguelite elements, such as dying forcing you to restart, and each run potentially unlocking either cosmetic \u201cpalettes\u201d that change the colors of the game, or new game modes called \u201cstyles\u201d that affect the character and levels.  You won't necessarily be taking anything from run to run except your understanding of the game and practice, but changing to the different styles may fit the way you play better and make a run more successful for you. For instance, the first style unlocked, Arm Spin Style, will make it so the player always finds new weapons in the side rooms that spawn, but shops won't spawn as often.  Most styles work  in this way by having both a positive and negative element.\n\nThe game does get much more difficult as you proceed.  You will end up doing quite a few runs before you even encounter the boss, and even then there's a good chance you'll get your ass kicked like I did when you finally see it.  The nature of Downwell and it's short sessions means that it is a game that's very friendly for popping in and out of without much commitment or overall time investment.  It's not necessarily that long of a game, but the challenge coerces you into investing more time than you'd imagine given the fairly minimal number of levels.  It also has a hard mode so if you are someone unlike myself and actually good at these sorts of games, you can find a new challenge after completing it.  \n\nThe only thing that would be more difficult than Downwell, is not recommending it.  That's why I'm going to take the easy route and say, for the already ridiculously low base price, it's well worth having and trying out.  You get a well crafted and enjoyable game that has great value and as fair amount of replayability.  That's pretty much all I look for in an indie title to convince me to pick it up.\n\nIf you'd like to see more of my reviews, check out my curator page here:

ideale per girare su qualsivoglia dispositivo senza problemi tecnici di sorta, se riscontrate problematiche nel FullScreen in Windows 10 vi consiglio di abilitare l'opzione Beta del gioco e tutto.\nIl gioco ha uno stile, che seppur risulta avere un palese effetto dejavu in titoli del passato fa il suo sporco lavoro aiutato da effetti di luce sulle armi davvero graziosi. Un comparto non per tutti ma che sicuramente risulta esser sufficiente\n-Main OST e Tracklist ad 8-BIT molto orecchiabili e mai troppo invasive ad invogliare la frustrazione nel giocatore ed anzi, invogliandolo in qualche modo, a continuare la giocata per sentire le varie variazioni di ritmo che si presenteranno nel corso dei vari livelli\n-Ludicamente parlando il titolo si presenta come una sorta di platform atipico, condito da shooting e quella vena Roguelike che pu\u00f2 piacere o meno (infatti ad ogni morte il gioco vi riporta all'inizio). Il gioco \u00e8 tutto in discesa (come gi\u00e0 il titolo pu\u00f2 far intuire) e la nostra avventura \u00e8 condita di potenziamenti per facilitare la nostra discesa. Il livello di difficolt\u00e0 \u00e8 sicuramente alto e la discesa sar\u00e0 letteralmente piena di Santi da sparare. Un gameplay semplice, fatto di frecce direzionali e di un solo tasto per il salto/fuoco quindi ideale per grandi e piccini.\n-La longevit\u00e0 varia da persona a persona a seconda delle vostre abilit\u00e0, gli sbloccabili o l'Hard Mode (ve ne era la necessit\u00e0?) non sono incentivi tali per un eventuale rigiocata una volta finito (come lo pu\u00f2 essere l'attacco al punteggio invece). In definitiva un paramentro molto variabile ma che sicuramente sapr\u00e0 dare delle soddisfazioni\n\n\nLASCIALO A STEAM PERCHE:\n-Se state cercando un titolo pieno di significato o di Storia state totalmente sbagliando genere perch\u00e8 non ne ha assolutamente...Spoiler sul Finale, non salvate neanche una principessa ma un semplice gattino quindi, no sangue amaro.\n-Se non preso alla leggera il gioco risulta sicuramente frustrante\n\nAvendolo snocciolato in toto posso dire che \u00e8 un gioco che vale davvero la pena almeno provare (e nel caso chiedere refund, visto anche l'esigua cifra richiesta per acquistarlo). Adatto letteralmente a chiunque ed ideale per farsi quella partita di 15min tra un pausa all'altra di giochi ben pi\u00f9 difficili o semplicemente quando si \u00e8 al PC per fare altro e non giocare.\n\nVOTO\n70/100\nOggettivamente per quanto bello e riuscito non pu\u00f2 prendere pi\u00f9 di questo score.", "timestamp_created": 1499691197, "timestamp_updated": 1499691197, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504497", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33425605": {"recommendationid": "33425605", "author": {"steamid": "76561197968547326", "num_games_owned": 296, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 253, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511591541}, "language": "english", "review": "Clean, simple fun.\n\nDownwell is a novel take on verticle shooters.

Me encantan, los adoro y me lo paso genial jug\u00e1ndolos. Por otro lado, soy incapaz de pasarme cualquiera de ellos. De hecho, creo que no me he pasado ning\u00fan roguelike de cuantos he jugado. Y s\u00ed, incluyo a Downwell. \u00bfQue qu\u00e9 hago analizando un juego que no me he pasado? Bueno, bueno. Le he tirado unas cuantas horas. Creo que las suficientes para sacar mis conclusiones.\n\nAlgo muy positivo que saco de estos juegos es el jugar por simple y pura diversi\u00f3n. Me recuerda a mi infancia, cuando me iba a la recreativa a dejarme las monedas de 5 duros. Juegos como este Downwell, The Binding of Isaac o Enter the Gungeon proporcionan horas de diversi\u00f3n sin preocuparte en el por qu\u00e9, ni pararte a pensar en el qui\u00e9n ni en el cu\u00e1ndo. Aqu\u00ed no hay m\u00e1s pretensi\u00f3n que el jugar. Son el equivalente actual a los juegos arcade de los que pod\u00edamos disfrutar hace ya unos cuantos (bastantes) a\u00f1os. Es m\u00e1s, al igual que por aquel entonces, si mueres pagas. En su momento con otra moneda m\u00e1s; ahora con tiempo, teniendo que empezar de cero cada vez. Si sumamos cosas como rankings y el compartir (v\u00eda stream, youtube y dem\u00e1s) tus partidas, tenemos un ambiente similar al de estos salones recreativos.\n\nPersonalmente, y al igual que me pasaba con las recreativas, mis partidas suelen ser cortas. Ni dispon\u00eda de mucho capital para tirar a la m\u00e1quina, ni ahora quiero sobrepasar la l\u00ednea entre diversi\u00f3n y estr\u00e9s porque se me resista alg\u00fan nivel o enemigo.

This one's not very long, with a full game potentially lasting less than 20 minutes, but the difficulty more than makes up for it. Very much a game you pick up, play, put down, and come back to often.\n\nI do think the game could've used some polish; the one button controls mean you occasionally have to bump into an enemy above you to go down, and many a cheap death occurred because the bats and squids are unfairly difficult to land on. The wall jump mechanic also plays against the player most of the time. These are relatively minor gripes compared to the price and the amount of enjoyment I got from it, though; otherwise, absolutely spot on. Required playing. (As an aside, excellent controller game. Supports XInput joypads, such as the 360 one, and you'll want it for this.)", "timestamp_created": 1497994011, "timestamp_updated": 1497994011, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32599158": {"recommendationid": "32599158", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057923867", "num_games_owned": 185, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 595, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498083460}, "language": "english", "review": "Worth every penny", "timestamp_created": 1497983257, "timestamp_updated": 1497983257, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32584565": {"recommendationid": "32584565", "author": {"steamid": "76561198356039916", "num_games_owned": 142, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 310, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505483710}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\ubc15\uc950 \uc2a4\ucf08\ub808\ud1a4 \uac1c\uc0c8~@!@~#~\ub07c\ub4e4\uc544!!!!!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1497938357, "timestamp_updated": 1497938393, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32584531": {"recommendationid": "32584531", "author": {"steamid": "76561198380352262", "num_games_owned": 161, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 652, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505368329}, "language": "english", "review": "The bats in the first area will have you staring daggers at the screen.

Just watch the YouTube videos that analyze downwell's game design, and you'll find it hard not to appreciate the game. \n\nHowever, despite its very high reception and lack of criticism, some things leave me a bit sour. \n\nLike, there's only 4 levels basically, because (to me at least) the sections for each layer felt exactly the same. For instance level 2-1 looked and felt exactly like level 2-2 and 2-3.  I also just felt the game actually got easier as you progress downward, which is really weird.  Once you can play it fairly well, it's easy to amass lots of ammo and then it becomes so easy to chain and get more life and also avoid taking damage by controlling your descent. The last layer is supposed to be hell-like but it's the easiest level to me by far, because of the lack of enemy variety, the fact that there's no floor (making chaining effortless), and the surplus of upgrades amassed once one has reached this layer.  I don't even get hit once hardly ever in this layer.  Then the final boss just cycles through a very short move rotation, so the pattern is very easy to beat.  \n\nSome weapons also seem kinda pointless to pick up even for a potential upgrade.  The laser is only really useful for the boss.  The other guns were all pretty useful, but they didn't feel too distinguished in my opinion.  The gameplay changes are quite subtle and don't really allow for much variation in play style, which is ok, but more distinct weapons would have I think added more depth.  \n\nI have a similar issue with the shuffling power ups between levels. Some seem like you'd never NOT want to pick them, while others seem mostly useless. They also seem to add to much luck into how much momentum you can generate which makes the game easier or harder.  \n\nMy biggest criticism besides the decreasing difficulty though is the lack of modes.  The additional modes here simply add slight spins on the \"get through the 4 layers\" thing.  For instance, in one mode you'll be more floaty. In another, you'll have slightly more life but less weapon upgrades.  This game really needed certain modes to knock this game out of the park.  An endless mode feels almost odd not to be there, considering the game being somewhat procedurally generated. There also could have been maybe a mode where you climb UP the well instead, and rather than only having 1 wall jump per chain, you can wall jump infinitely and you shoot from a hat instead of your shoes.  Or maybe a mode where you're rushing against some kind of insta-death thing from above, forcing you to worry less of chaining, and worrying more about moving as fast downwards as possible. For a game that does so much with so little, it could have also gotten exponentially more mileage out of additional game modes that shake up how the mechanics are used. \n\nThe game is really well designed, fun, and feels great, but I found the execution a bit disappointing so I'm a little surprised how little criticism there is.  I'm excited to get through hard mode now, but not sure how much more I can get out of this game.

In the early days of games your options about what you could do in a game were vastly more limited by the hardware of the age so developers had to get smart about how to make a game look, sound, and feel good enough to attract the attention of you and your precious currency.\n\nDownwell would have had no difficulty in this regard as it manages to create a fast paced action platform experience both simple and complete. The player descends into a well equipped with their trusty downward firing gunboots which can be used to destroy some enemies and platforms, and to slow your descent as you fall. You acquire gems for destroying your enemies as well as bonuses for stringing together kills without landing on a platform. Some enemies can be stomped on which will refill the gunboots limited charge, allowing you to keep the ability to control your descent while remaining airborne. Strewn to the left and right of the well as you tumble downward are treasure rooms and shops which contain power ups, and will thoughtfully freeze time when approached so that you can keep your current combo without having to skip them. When a level is completed you will be offered a choice of upgrades allowing you to further increase your abilities. Playing through multiple times will unlock different styles that mutate the game in various ways, as well as several colour palettes which can be chosen to suit your tastes.\n\nThis game has an excelent arcade feeling, fast paced action with frequent rewards and reinforcement which keeps you engaged constantly as well as an easy to learn, hard to master difficulty curve. The retro styled graphics demonstrate the effectiveness of an extreme limitation of colour if adapted well, both keeping enemies distinct from scenery and indicating enemies weaknesses, a critical game design choice in a fast paced platformer.

Every single mechanic the game uses has multiple purposes and some sort of risk/reward mechanic, giving it an unexpectedly high skill ceiling for how simple the controls and mechanics are: move left, right, jump, and shoot. Semi-random level generation ensures the game doesn't get stale but also  rarely feels like the levels are generated unfairly. Downwell also features alternate color schemes and playstyles as rewards for playing, as well as a hard mode for anybody who beats the game. $3 USD is a complete steal for this game, not even mentioning how often it goes on sale for 50% off or more. And it's even available for the same price on the iOS App Store and the Google Play Store, where it controls better than any other mobile platformer I've ever seen, in addition to having no ads or microtransations.

There are also I think seven different weapons that are reasonably well balanced, although Puncher is awful. \n\nA full run of the game is pretty quick, but unless you're a lot better than me at platformers it'll take you many hours to actually beat the game. About 95% of owners don't get that far anyway. I'm writing this after I just beat the game on normal for the first time, which took about 17 minutes for the run and over 20 hours of failure to get there. I got a lot of joy and frustation out of learning this game, annnnd I'm probably not going to go on to hardmode.\n\nAs a final note it'd be good to see a borderless window mode in the options, and seeded maps would probably be nice for people who speedrun.

At the first sight the gameplay is basic and simple, you have a button to jump/shoot from your boots and can move left and right, and while the controls are indeed simple there are more nuances to it, like a wall jump you can do, maintaining a combo to gain it's bonuses once you finish it or choosing the best upgrades to fit the style you choose to play.\n\nIn my modest opinion Downwell shines in the small details, like after reaching a new \"world\" the music only starts after you land on a platform or in an enemy. Using a limited color palette but still makes it easy to distinguish between the enemies you can land on from the ones you need to avoid to not take damage, and the same applies to environment and as you progress through the game you unlock more colors. Other small thing I appreciate in the game is since the time pauses when you enter one of the side rooms the music stops, and you not loses your combo, even though you recharge your boots by landing on them.\n\nI short i highly recommend this game.", "timestamp_created": 1494598855, "timestamp_updated": 1494598855, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.671615", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31700191": {"recommendationid": "31700191", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072081639", "num_games_owned": 68, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 25, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501064542}, "language": "english", "review": "hard to control\nfun", "timestamp_created": 1494590056, "timestamp_updated": 1494590056, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31693785": {"recommendationid": "31693785", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062547531", "num_games_owned": 614, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 532, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505346279}, "language": "english", "review": "A tight, simple and well made (rogue-lite) arcade game.

Gravity accelerates your fall, so to decelerate your fall, goomba stomp or shoot those pesky flying slimes and squids and other enemies to collect and accumulate gems to buy items from the shop, whether it be charges (to increase ammo count) and health (which is more expensive than charges). That's basically the gist of it, [spoiler] though there are other mechanics like powerups and gun modules, but that would be spoiling the game too much. [/spoiler]\n\nHowever, the difficulty curve definitely spikes up, which is an unexpected and unprecedented change. Given the simple controls and easily comprehensible mechanics, the difficulty is sensible and never feels like it is purposefully making the player want to point his or her metaphorical gunboots at the head and shoot. \n\nOnce you've beaten the blob of gelatinous and repugnant sewer beast that lives near the pit of the seemingly endless  well, you're welcomed with - guess what? - hardcore mode.\n\nIn my experience, a spirited and rigorous affair is always a conduit for self-improvement.

The gameplay is solid, level generation is outstanding. There aren't many levels and you don't unlock more during repeat playthroughs, however the ones that are there are unique and offer different playstyles, each level goes on for just long enough not to get bored of it. As for the playstyles, they range from your average platformer to race against time to having to use enemies as your only ground.\n\nThis game does require skill. The controls are just 3 buttons - run left, run right, jump and shoot are same button, you can only shoot downwards and only in midair, doing so will propel you upwards a little for extra air control. Using these few options for their full extent requires some practice, don't expect to beat this game quickly.\n\nThe roguelike aspect of the game is not affecting the gameplay as much some other games of the genre. There are 20 upgrades for 10 levels while some games have hundreds of items for 5 levels, and the levels while randomly generated are always linear.\n\nOn topic of upgrades, there are also multiple weapon types (modules) that while working differently have about the same firepower, therefore which weapon is better is to the player's choice. It's still beneficial to pick up weapons when you  find them because they can grant extra health and extend gunboot battery depending on module appearance.\n\nNow for an important topic - replay value.

Definitely. What is it like 3 bucks? For the price the experience is worth it. It's pretty simple to understand, has some rogue-lite elements and is just generally fun to play. I have a handful of issues with it, but beyond that I really think that anyone who likes the way it looks should definitely give it a go.\n\nSo yeah the game aesthetic is mostly very good. Simple colors and the likes. It all melds well aesthetically, though my biggest gripe is clarity. Enemies who are 'colored' and have 'no white' appear to deal damage to you no matter what. Most of the enemies that you 'don't want to touch' are pretty clear, but I don't fully understand what the 'white and colored' means because for example the toad enemy is white and colored, but if I touch him without falling I get hurt. Meanwhile there is some grub you can just run over? Whether or not it's fully clear at first, you learn though and in the end it's fine. Only a small complaint I feel. Otherwise the aesthetic is great and very well thought up for enemy identification.\n\nControls work great. Simple and yet so nice. They're very responsive and I haven't a single problem with em. Jump jumps and also shoots when you are jumping and it buys items and stuff when at the vendor. Left and right move...that's it! That's all ya need to know really. The game functions a little differently with 'different styles', but not much.\n\nThe meat of the game is what ya see in the vid. You fall and shoot. Fall and shoot. Bounce off enemies who are 'white and colored' (as I said in graphics) when you are falling and you can chain up your bounces. I think the bounce chain thing is quite rewarding and the kickback on weapons feels good creating a pretty nice dynamic to thinking about whether to shoot something outright, shoot to maintain your height or just fall. You also regen ammo by bouncing so yah. I think it's great!\n\nSound is good. It's not the most amazing stuff I have ever heard, but everything fits well. Shotgun has that 'thump' you'd expect, machine gun sounds good, etc. It's all good and such.\n\nIt's worth saying that in terms of the actual LENGTH of the game, it's pretty short. The rogue-lite elements, alternate styles and unlockables extend it a bit, but not by much. I feel it's worth it though. I think that's all there is to really say about the game. Just simple fun. There isn't really a story, but the aesthetic and ambience is really nice. Not sure what else to say to be honest.\n\n3 bucks or less. Worth it definitely.

[/i]\n\nJudgement : [u] Worth Full Price [/u]\n\nDownwell is a simple concept executed flawlessly. It's incredibly rudimentary in its design, but this simplicity and forwardness is what allows it to work so well. It's lean, and everything in it is running multiple functions for the sake of streamlining how the entire game controls. This may sound like a negative, but Downwell was designed with mobile devices in mind, which is one of the reasons that it is presented in a portrait style, and its mobile home is why it has only three buttons. However, this does nothing to detract from how it plays, and as someone who played it on both mobile and PC, I can say for certain that here is where it shines. \n\nA lot of what I want to say on this game is covered by Mark Brown in a series he makes called Game Maker's Toolkit. His video on Downwell succinctly covers what about the base design allows Downwell to function so well, and I highly recommend watching the video, even if you're not too interested in the game right now.\nLink: https://youtu.be/i5C1Uj7jJCg\n\nNow, since he covers a lot of what I would cover at this point, I want to talk from the perspective of someone who got [i] really, really good [/i] at this game. I told myself that I would beat the game completely before I wrote this review, and that meant completing Hard, which I just managed to do.\nAnd by God if Ojiro Fumoto (the developer) didn't make me fucking work for it.\nAs Mark said, this game demands that you play by its rules. It forces you to play fast and loose, and by the time you've cleared the game on Normal, you've started picking up on the bonuses speed and style confer, with combos providing health and ammo increases.\nWhen you start attempting Hard, you'll realize that those bonuses are not just nice, they're mandatory. This game demands that you think while it's going by at 100m/s. You have to plan how you want to approach each part, and which powerups are likely to result in success. For something that looks and feels so simple, it has real depth to it (pun intended). Getting good at this game becomes a test in pure reaction speed and muscule memory. You start subconciously remembering how everything is supposed to go on a good run, and you'll begin realizing how well the visual feedback keeps the player informed. As speed increases you spend less time trying to recognize enemies, and just begin reacting without thought. When you get going fast, this game almost becomes zen in its playstyle, with you effortlessly bouncing off enemies and blasting others while you descend.\n\nDownwell is a testament to the idea that a simple concept can be wholly engrossing. It didn't need flashy visuals, a budget the size of Montana, or even dialogue. Its arcade like gameplay managed to pull me in with what it has, and it did it for very, very little cash.\n\nAt the end of the day, the question is whether Downwell is worth your money or not. \nAnd it absolutely is.\nThe fact that it's only $3 just makes this an even easier recommendation, even though I would've recommended it at $10. It's great, it really is, and if you can appreciate a challenge, you'll find plenty available for you here.\n\n\n[i] Plus, how awesome is it that you have Gunboots? Boots that are Guns? Who wouldn't want that? [/i]\n\nReally, for less than the price of a half-decent sandwich, you'll get one of the best little gems out there. A mechanical masterpiece, and a game I'm likely to still dive into now and then for years to come. It takes little time and little money to give Downwell a shot, and it's worth every penny and second you give it.\n", "timestamp_created": 1487733966, "timestamp_updated": 1487733966, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520707", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30082043": {"recommendationid": "30082043", "author": {"steamid": "76561198252986670", "num_games_owned": 179, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 129, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512048999}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u80fd\u8bbe\u8ba1\u51fa\u8fd9\u4e48\u6070\u5230\u597d\u5904\u7684\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u6211\u60f3\u9760\u7684\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4ec5\u662f\u7075\u611f\u5427\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1487694493, "timestamp_updated": 1487694493, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519231", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30061076": {"recommendationid": "30061076", "author": {"steamid": "76561198317266193", "num_games_owned": 461, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 789, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498561314}, "language": "schinese", "review": "ORZ\u809d\u4e86\u516b\u5c0f\u6642\u4ecd\u7136\u5361\u5728\u7b2c\u4e09\u5927\u95dc\uff0c\u8eab\u9ad4\u88ab\u638f\u7a7a\n\u611f\u89ba\u81ea\u5df1\u8d8a\u4f86\u8d8a\u624b\u6b98\uff0c\u5beb\u500b\u8a55\u6e2c\u4e0d\u73a9\u5566\n\uff08\u256f\u2018\u25a1\u2032\uff09\u30ce\u253b\u2501\u253b \u6380\u684c\n+BGM\u5e36\u611f\uff0c\u756b\u9762\u61f7\u820a\n+\u5c04\u64ca\u624b\u611f\u8207\u97f3\u6548\u4ff1\u4f73\n+\u7bc0\u594f\u660e\u6717\n+\u6613\u4e0a\u624b\uff0c\u537b\u53c8\u4e0d\u5931\u53ef\u73a9\u5ea6\n-\u96e3\u5ea6\u611f\u4eba\uff0c\u901a\u95dc\u8981\u7df4\u7fd2\u5f88\u9577\u6642\u9593\n-\u6210\u5c31\u89e3\u9396\u8271\u82e6\n\u6253\u6298\u5927\u6982\u662f5-7\u817f\uff0c\u7576\u7136\u5176\u5be6\u539f\u50f9\u5165\u4e5f\u4e0d\u7b97\u592a\u8667\n\u62ff\u4f86\u6253\u767c\u6642\u9593\u883b\u597d\u7684\n\u4ee5\u4e0a", "timestamp_created": 1487608541, "timestamp_updated": 1495599992, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.469799", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30057433": {"recommendationid": "30057433", "author": {"steamid": "76561198111527069", "num_games_owned": 252, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 197, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485221438}, "language": "english", "review": "Is hard, and that is good. this is the kind of game that keep you trying to complete it, and when you do it the feel is priceless. and is cheap.", "timestamp_created": 1487597821, "timestamp_updated": 1487597821, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30052216": {"recommendationid": "30052216", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055482009", "num_games_owned": 313, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 241, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491704810}, "language": "english", "review": "Don't let the small play time on Steam fool you. I've been spending hours on this game through the Android and Vita versions, and those are exactly the same game you get here.\n\nDownwell is a very addicting Roguelike experience. The goal of the game is to go down a well as far as you can without dying. Sounds simple, right? Well, the game is not afraid to show you that it's not messing around, as it can overwhelm you with enemies as early as level 1, and the game only gets harder from there. I myself have never managed to get past world 3 (out of 4 worlds in total, not counting the ending boss fight), even after I managed to accumulate over 150,000 gems over the course of playing the Vita version, and unlocking all of the play styles on both Android and Vita. The game does have a pretty high learning curve, but once you know how everything works, you'll start managing some pretty good runs.\n\nUnlockables are pretty nice. Collecting gems counts to an overall total, and when you die or complete your run, the gems you collected will count towards a progression bar that levels up when you reach a certain milestone. Every time you reach that milestone, you'll unlock either one of 4 additional playstyles that each add a different set of rules for your run, which can increase replayability and experimentation, or one of dozens of pallete swaps that change the color scheme of the game. Rather than all of them be \"red turns green\" however, the palletes can also consist of screen alterations inspired by game consoles and 8-bit visual styles, or even just be very random screen changes. Just be mindful that some of them may cause the game to be a lot harder because of them being incredibly bright or consisting of a single solid color, making damageable enemies hard to distinguish.\n\nMy only real complaint is that the combo system doesn't feel very rewarding, to an extent. How the combos work is that for every kill you get while airborne, it gets added to a combo, with the count showing after you reach 5. When you reach 8 kills, you get 100 gems once the combo ends on landing. Hitting 15 gives you an additional gun charge along with the 100 gems. Hitting 25 gives you a free point of HP along with the previous benefits. The problem I have with this is that this is really it. You don't get any additional rewards by getting bigger and bigger combos, even if you were to hit numbers as high as 600+ (which is possible. Look up videos on Youtube). This does suck up any incentive of getting combos higher than 25 unless you're just going for the acheivements or bragging rights. What would've been nice is that for every 50 kills you get in a combo, or even 100, the rewards you get are added by 1. For example, if you hit 50, you get 200 gems, 2 charges, and 2 hearts, and hitting you 100 gives you 300 gems, 3 charges, 3 hearts, and so on. That would be a nice incentive for racking up higher combos, especially in a game that encourages players to stomp on enemies to stay airborne.\n\nThat's really my only negative, and it's more of a nitpick than anything else.

The only way to progress in downwell is to master the game, but thankfully it's super fun and super rewarding(and it looks REALLY badass and impressive once you've mastered the combo system and barely ever touch the ground anymore).

tenes un mando para jugar, el control con teclado se vuelve muy ortodoxo.\n\n-El juego muchas veces llega a ser injusto por el simple hecho de que hay enemigos que no los podes esquivar (o matar) de ninguna forma y te tenes que comer el da\u00f1o.\n\n-La hitbox es una mierda, 2 milimetros al costado de un enemigo y te hace da\u00f1o :i.\n\n-Poco contenido, me gustaria que hubieran mas cosas, diferentes modos de juego, mas personalizacion en el juego y mas objetos, que hubiera mas areas que solo se pueden ingresar si haces ciertas cosas e incluso estaria bueno una historia, pero eso ya es pedir mucho, aunque yo se que como esta hecho este juego da para mucho.\n\n-Muy repetitivo, aunque eso no es lo malo, es la gracia del juego, lo malo de que sea tan repetitivo es por lo que dije antes, la hitbox y las cosas injustas que pasan, pasan tantas veces que ya llega un momento donde le agarras odio al nivel y a ciertos monstruos a.k.a enemigos, incluso he llegado a estar enojado por culpa del juego este -.-.\n\nResumen: Buen juego, compralo solo si tenes un mando. 7/10", "timestamp_created": 1483646359, "timestamp_updated": 1483646359, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0,

Con armas colocadas a nuestros pies. Avanzas matando enemigos disparando con distintas armas, no hay mucha variedad de estas, pero no est\u00e1 mal.\n\nComo Rogue-Like que es, tambi\u00e9n hay mejoras. Al superar una zona te aparecer\u00e1n 3 mejoras, de las cuales solo podr\u00e1s elegir una, tampoco hay mucha variedad, despu\u00e9s de haber jugado un rato has visto todas las que hay. Como est\u00e1is viendo, es un juego con poco contenido.\n\nEs un juego que te puede dar muchas horas, o pocas horas. Depende de la persona, en mi opini\u00f3n he tenido bastante. Con la reciente adquisici\u00f3n de uno de los Rogue-Likes de moda, que es The Binding of Isaac, este se ve superado con creces. Pero si no dispones de TBoI, este es un juego decente.\n\nEst\u00e1 falto de contenido, respecto a otros del g\u00e9nero, como puede ser el ya nombrado The Binding of Isaac, Enter the Gungeon, Nuclear Throne...\nEn mi opini\u00f3n, este tipo de juegos son los t\u00edpicos de pasar el rato, en tiempos muertos.

Is it a balance reason (area 4) or is there other reason to not make it repeat the rewards after 25, forcing you to break them.\n\nThe achievements feels like they worsen the experience instead of making it better, making you do things that go against how you should play (100 combo, beat a level without shooting, beat a level without killing enemies, etc) but most of them are easy to do so no big deal. This kind of achievement should be things like \"beat the game without using shops\" or \"beat the game in X:XX time\" \"beat the game without changing weapons more than one time per area\" so you actually get a real challenge out of doing them even if they go against how the game should be played, it currently feels just like a waste of time to get them because they aren't rewarding.

And when I first saw Downwell I was sure I found a great companion for deuces to come. \n\nI think Devolver digital has been publishing games for me. They seem to be on a role with Titan souls, Olli Olli, Ronin and of course Hotline Miami. Most of the game they publish seem to have similar attributes; unique presentation and creative balls-in-your face gameplay. Also guns...lots of guns.\n\nThe art in Downhill shines through its simplicity, the developer (Moppin) used 8-bit style graphics with great effect that suit the idea of where the game takes place, Downwell. From the name Downwell, the game starts by simply jumping down a well. The game is constructed in a level based progression, and you have a number of hit-points if depleted you have to start from the top. Simply put, it\u2019s a roguelike. \n\nThe gameplay mechanics are all in the boots. Touch the the direction button and the character will jump towards where you pressed, press the shoot button and his boots will shoot downwards. Along the drop, you will find upgrades in caves or shops that will either give you more HP, more bullets or  different kind of Gunboots. There are a number of excellent Gunboots to play with, ranging from Shotgunboots, Lasergunboots, Blastgunboots...etc.\n\nThere is mostly two ways to kill enemies; obviously the first is by shooting them with your Gunboots, the other is simply by jumping on their heads. And with each kill the enemies drop red gems for bartering in the shops. Kill enemies in succession and your kills will generate even more gems.\n\nAt first the game may seem, or at least to me, to be impossible to get through, but the mechanics are well-made to make you learn something new with each death. \n\nEach level in the game is made with it\u2019s own unique theme and enemies. And each level is divided into four parts. It also keeps each run fresh as it\u2019s randomly generated. In the end of each part of each level, you will have the option to choose from a number of upgrades; refill HP, shop items cost 10% less, shooting enemy carcass will cause them to explode...etc. What\u2019s great about these abilities is that they stack up as you progress, but of course, being a roguelike, die and you lose it all.\n\nIn the end, if you want a mobile game good enough to make your legs go numb on the toilet, I highly recommend Downwell. The game also available on Steam if you prefer it on the big screen with a controller.\n\n9/10", "timestamp_created": 1483140762, "timestamp_updated": 1483140762, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28845394": {"recommendationid": "28845394", "author": {"steamid": "76561197988484703", "num_games_owned": 162, "num_reviews": 70, "playtime_forever": 53, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499009330}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Gran juego para los amantes de la \u00e9poca de los 8bits.

Unknowing that the person crying for help was a person looking for a worthy foe to fight, you donned your gunbbots (the only form of protection you have) and take a leap of faith into the well, unknowing what (or who) you might meet at the bottom.\n\nThis highly addicting Arcade-like shooter will keep you entertained for hours as you try and try again to get to the bottom of the well. It also comes with some rouge-like elements and strategy elements, with not only block and enemy placement being randomly generated each time, but with the different powerups and upgrades each run you know each run won't be the same.\nFor people who like retro gaming, this game features Game-Boy-like graphics as well as a 3 color scheme through out, with some of the additional colors being from the gameboy and virtualboy's themselves (noteworthy in my review, as I am still a Nintendo fan.)\n\nThe only thing I didn't like about this game is the flying enemies, as if you don't take them out while they're at the lower portion of your screen then they can fly down from above and deal damage (and believe me when I say this, if your playing the normal style or any other style with only 4 hp to begin with, this little fact will doom you.) Also, most enemies you can kill by stomping on them (a plus) unless it's a black ghost or a giant eyeball (just to name 2.)\n\nOverall, not a bad game! I'd recommend picking it up during a sale to get the most out of your money, but still, it's worth adding to the collection if your a retro gamer. Did I forget to mention that this game is ironacally small enough to fit on an original Game Boy cartridge?", "timestamp_created": 1482727829, "timestamp_updated": 1482728049, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.573015", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28652946": {"recommendationid": "28652946", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072085131", "num_games_owned": 30, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 222, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513010929}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Este juego no es buen\u00edsimo, no tiene una gran banda sonora ni su dise\u00f1o es muy innovador pero venga ya, cuesta 3\u20ac y no te vas a morir por probarlo.

It gets repetitive quickly, with its limited range of enemies to fight, environments to traverse, and upgrades to unlock. After the initial glow fades, the only incentive to keep playing is the gem progress system, which enslaves players to play the game for massive amounts of time in order to unlock \"palettes\" (3-tone color schemes for the game, most of them end up making it look substantially worse than default) and \"styles\" (bland perks that can be applied before a run, only two are worth playing). I am also bewildered as to why this game's performance can dip so dramatically at times on my better-than-average PC. I can run GTA V at 60fps consistently, but Downwell chokes and studders when too much is going on on-screen. Totally unacceptable for a 2D pixel game. The enemy hitboxes leave something to be desired too, as my character will often take damage from jumping on enemies from skewed angles. The shopkeeper only stocks four unique items, by the way.

Everything in it has reason to exist, and it all intertwines to create an incredibly fun and addicting experience.\nIt only requires 3 buttons to play, and the single focus of the game is to reach the end of the well. While that might seem way too simplistic, it is the reason why the game is so well designed and grabs you from the very beginning.\nShooting and bouncing on enemies is extremely fun and the beautiful genius of the game is that it rewards players who go for the \"fun\" way of playing the game, while also being more challenging if you do so. It creates a perfect balance between being cautious and wreckless, with the health system being the constant that ties those two together. Health is incredibly vital and every mistake you make will be felt.\nThe way the game gives you different weapons is also brilliant, because even if you get attached to  certain one, you may feel inclined to swap it for another one who also comes with a health point. This dynamic is what keeps the game tense and engaging, and keeps the game from becoming boring and predictable.\nBeating each stage earns you a new power up from a handful of choices, and they all have their uses and advantages.\nThe presentation of the game is great, with a very retro style 8-bit aesthetic that manages to give alot of charm to the enemies and environment, and the color is used to great effect to make the objects of interest stand out and pop up.\nI came into this game with the mindset that it was just a mobile game, with every kind of pejorative aspect people seem to atribute to that name, but I was surprisingly glad to find out it was one of the best games I played in a while.\nReally the one thing I can think of that might be a negative is that there doesnt seem to be any kind of narrative incentive to make you finish the game? Was my time spent here really worth it? *watches the post credit scene*.

The goal is to see how far you can get and/or how high a score you can get. The simplicity of the controls makes it easy to get into, but the ways you can interact using said controls can get a bit complicated. Your gun-boots have a limited number of bullets, and you reload automatically when you land. However, there are certain enemies which can be jumped on (this is made clear by the colors - red is dangerous, white is safe), and in addition to killing them, jumping on an enemy will also reload your gun. This way, you can juggle back and forth between shooting enemies that can't be jumped on and reloading your gun by landing on safe enemy's heads. How many enemies can you kill before having to land on the ground? The game will reward you for combos with exp/gems, which adds an addictive layer of complexity to the gameplay.\nIn addition to the core gameplay machanics, there are are also gems to colelct which can be used to buy stuff at stores, which sell extra health and extra ammo slots. There are different weapon types to pick up, Contra-style (some of which are bundled with health, which can create some fun choices - this gun I know I don't like, but should I take it anyway to get the extra heatlth?). At the end of each section, you get to pick from one of three random free upgrades. You'll never know which three you'll get to choose from, but you do get to take your pick from the three presented to you. Lots of fun power-ups and upgrades to keep things interesting.\nAt the begining of each round you have your choice of \"style\" which are slightly differing playstyles to pick from (for example, one might give you more health to start with but fewer upgrade options after each section). These will need to be unlocked using exp, which get after each round, based on how far you got, how many combos you made, etc. They add a little variety to the game, letting players choose a prefered play style.\nAnother thing you'll unlock with exp is color pallete swaps, which are super fun. The game is by default only three colors - white, black and red. Black is background, white is platforms/safe parts of enemies to touch, and red is gems/unsafe parts of enemies to touch. The pallete swaps just change what these colors are, which is a fun little aesthetic touch. Be warned, though - some of the color palletes actually make the game harder. You'll know what I mean when you try them out.\nOverall, this is an excellent little game and a steal for the price. I highly recomend it to anyone in search for a high-action, highly-addictive distraction with an elegant balance of simple controls and deep gameplay.", "timestamp_created": 1480469732, "timestamp_updated": 1480469732, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28084975": {"recommendationid": "28084975", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020125851", "num_games_owned": 8444, "num_reviews": 716, "playtime_forever": 124, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480444099}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]A Roguelike Arcade Action Shooter[/h1]\nhttps://youtu.be/uJ5KgwI1vzw\n+ Fun fast-paced addictive gameplay.  The goal is to make it as far down the well as you can without dying. There are many enemies that you must dodge or defeat by landing on or shooting them with your Gunboots. \n+ Many roguelike elements which add a great deal to replayability such as being able to select a perk at the end of each stage which will make every run different from the previous.\n+ A good selection of weapons that add a nice sense of variety to each run. These will change your default gunboots to things like a downward laser, shotgun, machine gun, and so fourth.\n+ Enemies drop gems which can be used at the shop to buy health or additional energy (ammo). This adds a nice strategic element to the game. Do you slow down to kill all the enemies to collect gems, or do you avoid them completely to avoid being hit? \n+ Very challenging. This is the type of game were you will constantly improve overtime as your reflexes, knowledge, and skill grow.\n+ Surprisingly enjoyable visual style. The game has a very minimalistic retro style mainly consisting of only 3 colors (you can unlock additional color pallets)  At first I thought I'd be turned off by this, but red mixes with the black & white environments quite well and the developer did a great job creating a variety of enemies and obstacles.\n\n- I was a bit annoyed that many enemies can fly from above down toward you (bats, ghosts, etc.) and you do not have the ability to shoot up or sideways.\n- No real end-game goal or story objective.

That combo system makes playing through earlier levels an absolute joy as you build huge combos that'll give you the resources to tackle later levels.  The various Styles mix up gameplay in unique ways, and due to how quickly you unlock them all, it never feels like the game is holding any of its mechanics hostage.  Every unlock after that is entirely comsetic palette swaps, which gives the game an old-school charm.  The music is fantastic, and the way it syncs up to your first contact at the start of every level provides not only simple satisfaction, but also serves as feedback when attempting the \"Ground Allergy\" acheivement.  The game is just full of these clever little desgn decisions.  In conclusion, this game is incredibly well designed and inexpensive, you really don't have any reason not to buy it.", "timestamp_created": 1480403662, "timestamp_updated": 1498779058, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28026161": {"recommendationid": "28026161", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053242036", "num_games_owned": 112, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 879, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496813865}, "language": "english", "review": "This is the perfect game to just sit down and play for 10 minutes or get lost in for an hour.

This is especially true in the case of Downwell, which at first glance seems like a game with little depth but is actually one of the deepest and most fun experiences I\u2019ve had all year.\n\nThe goal of Downwell is pretty simple: you\u2019re a boy falling down a well and you have to reach the bottom. Sounds easy right? But standing in your way are all manner of enemies and obstacles. Each \u2018floor\u2019 of the well is divided into 3 sections, and when you reach a new floor a new challenge awaits you. Thankfully you\u2019re not helpless: your character is equipped with special bullet-firing boots which you use to vanquish your enemies and remove obstacles blocking your path. The boots have several different modes that you can switch between by collecting power-ups hidden in side caves, from the powerful shotgun that cuts through enemies likes butter but uses up your ammo just as fast to the rapid-fire machine gun. It adds greatly to the strategy of the game. You can replenish your ammo at any time by landing on the ground, although the more enemies you can kill before that happens, the greater the reward. These rewards can range from gems (that you use to buy items in shops) to extra hit points.\n\nAnd you\u2019ll need all the hit points you can get, because this game gets difficult in a hurry. On the game\u2019s default settings you can only take four hits & then it\u2019s game over. You can get health refills from shops, by picking up new weapon modules or exceeding a certain amount of kills before you hit solid ground, but that can only take you so far. Make no mistake; when you first start playing Downwell you\u2019ll die, and you\u2019ll die a lot, but never in a way that feels particularly unfair. If you failed, it\u2019s because you weren\u2019t ready or you just aren\u2019t good enough yet. Fortunately you\u2019ll pick up the basics pretty quicker and from there you\u2019ll get better and better until you actually win. Practice makes perfect.\n\nBut perhaps the biggest appeal of Downwell is that it\u2019s so easy to pick up and play. In spite of the simplistic pixel art graphics I couldn\u2019t stop myself coming back to it again and again. The game rewards you more the more time you put into it. At the end of every game you\u2019ll receive XP depending on how well you played and how far you got. The more XP you have, the more rewards you can unlock, from new colour palettes that can completely change the way the game looks to new gameplay styles, such as making your character\u2019s physics more floaty or having more HP at the start of the game, at a cost. You can also unlock [spoiler]Hard Mode[/spoiler] by beating the game once, although this feels unfair at times and honestly, isn\u2019t as fun in my opinion.\n\nUltimately Downwell is a rip-roaring experience that packs so much content into its tiny package. No two games ever feel quite the same.

Unstompable? All red: a clearly visible threat.

It is the same game over, and over again, with slight differences in the levels, everytime. My main problem is how you're just dropped into the game. There is no tutorial, not even a selectable one. I hopped into the game, and died in about 10 seconds. I shrugged it off, tried it again, and got to the caverns. I died, and I was sent back to the first level. It's just repetitive. Enemies, bats in particular, can be a surprise. There are some enemies you can't kill with a gun, some you cant kill with your jump, ones that stand on walls, or throw projectiles at you. You just have to play the game over, and over again to learn the basics of the game. What makes this even worse is the graphics. I'm not talking about how its pixelated, it suits the game well. What does bother me is the fact that its a clusterfuck. Projectiles, explosions, gems, etc. And because every item is in the same 3 colors, you can tell that its gonna get messy, and hard to understand. I realize that this is meant to be a game to master, and takes experience, but all I'm saying is let the player learn the basics before killing them in cold blood.

Shooting is also just as much about stalling your descent as it is about taking out the baddies. \n\nThis is a game that takes some time before the gameplay feels fluid. During that time though, you will be rapidly unlocking both palettes and styles, the latter actually affecting gameplay. When your \"floaty\" style is unlocked (slows your descent), is likely the same time you'll feel comfortable with pulling off combos. Combos are risk/reward-based, as keeping one alive can often be dangerous, but will yield substantial benefits depending on what you manage to pull off. \n\nThis combo system is what really makes the game for me.\n\nAlso, my eyes are much more keen on reading what is going on with older (80s/early 90s) shmups and platformers, where explosions, debris, and other effects didn't hinder my vision too much. Once you're eyes adjust to Downwell's palette, it's very easy to tell what's what and play effectively.\n\nPlay control is perfect.\n\nI am not a big fan of the soundtrack, written by the guy who did Spelunky's, but that's just personal preference. I usually put on a NES music playlist or a retro game soundtrack, depending on my mood. Believe it or not, doing this really helps me in this game; it sort of gets me in the zone in a way that the stock music doesn\u2019t.\n\n20 hours in, I can\u2019t recommend this game highly enough, even to those not sure they\u2019d like a game like this. Most retro-revival games are thoroughly lacking. As simple as this game is, at least on the surface, it is, dare I say, one of the deepest retro-ish games I\u2019ve played on PC to date.\n", "timestamp_created": 1476983055, "timestamp_updated": 1476983055, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26131218": {"recommendationid": "26131218", "author": {"steamid": "76561198149979108", "num_games_owned": 107, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 780, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487629780}, "language": "english", "review": "very nice - palettes are very fun.

The action is furious and constant, and there's almost always something happening: an enemy to avoid (or stomp on), a secret cave to head towards, an obstacle to work around or blast through. Whenever there *is* any breathing room, like when you duck into a cave for a power-up, visit the shop, or choose your upgrade between levels, you get a welcome sense of momentary calm before you jump back out into the pit of blobs, bats, ghosts, and weird monsters. The pacing is just spot-on; every level is the perfect length, so Downwell never wears out its welcome for a second. In addition, each level is procedurally created in a rogue-like kind of style, so there's a lot of variety and every run is a bit different. This makes the whole experience into something that is really addictive and rewarding. You can even unlock different playstyles, which allows you to personalize your play and try out different tricks and strategies.\n\nI honestly can't think of a single real criticism of this game. The graphics are simple but very expressive and memorable (love the Shopkeeper). The game is hard but fair...whenever you die, you know that you made a mistake in the heat of play and you either stomped on an enemy that you shouldn't have or took a breather on a platform when you really should have kept going. I do have to admit that I really hate the bats, those things have a way of finding you and flying right over head just as you bounce off of something. Remember: *around bats, watch your backs.* The game is tough enough that it's going to take me a good while to beat it, but I don't think that this is the sort of game that you play through, beat, and then put away.

Il suddetto omino dispone di un accessorio chiamato \"GunBoots\", degli speciali stivali che fungono da arma da fuoco, con cui potr\u00e0 fronteggiare i diversi nemici che lo ostacoleranno nella sua vorticosa discesa. Il gioco si snoda in 4 aree dalla diversa ambientazione (ognuna divisa in 3 livelli), al termine delle quali affronteremo una boss battle. \n\nUn po' SHMUP e un po' platformer, Downwell si presenta da subito come un gioco essenziale, tanto che lo stile grafico rasenta la bicromia, e sin dalle battute iniziali sembra di trovarsi tra le mani una vecchia cartuccia del nostro fedele Game Boy. Come succedere per molti titoli di questo genere per\u00f2 anche in questo caso \"l'abito NON fa il monaco\": scavando sotto la semplicit\u00e0 delle forme troveremo infatti in Downwell un titolo dal gameplay veloce e avvincente, ma soprattutto ESTREMAMENTE impegnativo.\n\nIn ogni platformer che si rispetti, la chiave di volta del gameplay sta generalmente nella meccanica del salto e/o nelle sue eventuali reinterpretazioni. In Downwell l'accento viene per\u00f2 curiosamente spostato sulla gestione dei movimenti del nostro personaggio mentre si trova in caduta libera: il salto \u00e8 solo l'espediente che ci permette di proseguire nella nostra discesa, mentre lo scopo principale sar\u00e0 quello di planare rimbalzando sulle teste dei nemici senza mai toccare terra, in modo da realizzare combo sempre pi\u00f9 lunghe. \n\nI GunBoots si rivelano un'arma doppiamente utile a questo scopo: se infatti da un lato i proiettili possono eliminare direttamente i nemici, dall'altro ogni proiettile genera un rinculo che rallenta la nostra caduta, permettendo di aggiustare la traiettoria della planata quanto basta per raggiungere un nuovo nemico e proseguire cos\u00ec nella nostra combo. Vi assicuro che per quanto possa suonare semplice, tutto questo richiede una buona dose di riflessi e grande tempismo. Il sistema dei controlli ci viene in aiuto almeno in parte con la semplicit\u00e0 dei comandi: se pensate che un D-pad e 4 pulsanti siano pochi sappiate che Downwell ne usa soltanto 3 (A/D per movimenti laterali. shift per il salto).\n\nL'uccisione dei nemici e l'esecuzione di combo verranno premiati con una quantit\u00e0 di gemme colorate, utilizzabili come valuta nei vari store che incontreremo nella nostra avventura; in questi negozi, identificabili come varchi sulle pareti laterali del pozzo, potremo acquistare alcuni oggetti (non molti in verit\u00e0) che ci permetteranno, ad esempio, di recuperare salute o di aumentare la capacit\u00e0 di fuoco della nostra arma. Oltre ai negozi potremmo incappare in caverne contenenti cumuli di gemme o power-up a salute e \"carica\", valore quest'ultimo che rappresenta in sostanza la capacit\u00e0 del caricatore dei nostri GunBoots. I power-up hanno l'effetto collaterale di modificare la tipologia di arma in possesso (in gergo \"modulo\"): vi sono differenti tipologie di armi (laser, fucile, sparo triplo, ecc) ognuna con caratteristiche di potenza, rate-of-fire e dimensioni del caricatore differenti.\n\nAd aggiungere un po' di pepe all'esperienza arcade si inserisce la generazione procedurale degli scenari e il sistema di upgrade a fine livello, che attingono a piene mani dal genere rogue-like. I potenziamenti (similmente a quanto accade in Nuclear Throne) sono scelti tra un elenco generato casualmente, sono permanenti e garantiscono vantaggi di diverso tipo - ad esempio la possibilit\u00e0 di attrarre le gemme droppate dai nemici, di ricaricare i GunBoots con le gemme o ancora di recuperare punti vita ingurgitando i cadaveri dei nemici (ugh). La tanto amata (ma da chi?) perma-death, altro elemento cardinale dei rogue-like, \u00e8 sempre presente; rispetto al gi\u00e0 citato Nuclear Throne la frustrazione di dover ricominciare tutto da capo \u00e8 parzialmente mitigata dalla presenza di un buon numero di \"unlockables\". Accumulando gemme nei nostri playthrough potremo infatti sbloccare diverse palette, ossia schemi di colori alternativi applicabili per ovviare alla monotonia dello schema di default, o ancora potremo acquisire nuovi stili di movimento per il nostro omino bianco, che si traducono in bonus/malus predefiniti pi\u00f9 o meno bilanciati e sono sempre accompagnati da una simpatica animazione (ad esempio lo stile \"macigno\" fa s\u00ec che il personaggio si muova rotolando come un masso). \n\nSe avete letto altre mie recensioni (e in caso contrario vi invito caldamente a farlo) saprete che non mi piace dilungarmi nella descrizione del comparto audio/video di un gioco arcade, a meno che non sia particolarmente degno di nota. Nel caso di Downwell meritano senz'altro un plauso la colonna sonora in chiptune e la fedelissima riproduzione in grafica 8-bit: l'aspetto \u00e8 talmente NES-like che sembra di trovarsi di fronte ad un titolo uscito nel 1985.\n\nAttualmente (09/16) proposto allo scandaloso prezzo di 3 caff\u00e8, direi che non c'\u00e8 proprio nessuna scusa per non portarsi a casa questa chicca neo-arcade.

Professional reviews showered the game with praise and I decided to yell CHECK on it.\n\nUnfortunately Downwell, while not bad, doesn't blow my mind either. It fails on three levels. The easiest to describe is a technical one. You are playing the arcade, presumably skill based game and the last thing you want to experience as a player are the framerate drops when you get hit. Stupidly enough, those framedrops seem to be intentional on the behalf of the developer and I seriously question, if someone thought this was a good idea.\n\nMy second gripe is an unsatisfying gameplay loop. Imagine... You jump into the well. There are enemies that like to ambush, chase and attack in most annoying ways possible. Bats are an epitome of unfairness, when they can attack you off-screen or be placed in the most inconvenient places. You will get hit and your health pool is small and hard to recover. Controls are hyper-sensitive and as you try to get use to a weapon upgrade you don't like, you die... and the process starts all over again.\n\nIt's not really satisfying enough. In other good perma-death games you feel that you are getting better and that next try will be more successful... or you figured out the new strategy. However, in Downwell, you will find yourself blaming the game more than your lack of skill. Game gets slightly better on later levels when game decides to be fairer and enemies are far more predictable. Still, you will spend far more time in Caverns and Catacombs and get frustrated with those bats and skulls and other annoyances (and coincidently, the music after level 2 becomes much less painful for ears)\n\nAt last, what happens when you make a good progress or finishing the game? You get nothing. There are unlockables, but they are so obvious afterthought that it's counterproductive to mention it. I walked away from the game being angry and relieved that I'm finally done with it. I had similar experience with Spelunky, which are a platformer that likes to emphasize luck over a genuine skill.\n\nAnd you tell me that some game journalist gave this game a 10/10? I struggle to find anything remarkable in Downwell's design or execution. I would suggest avoiding this game. It's not worth your time and effort in my opinion, but it's not a trainwreck, so maybe you will find something in it. I fold.\n\n[i]Full disclosure: I wrote review about this game previously, but my opinions weren't very helpful judging by the votes.

Realmente las m\u00e9canicas del juego son muy buenas, tiene un sistema de combos adictivo que te invita a caer sobre los enemigos sin tocar el suelo, puedes utilizar los disparos de tus botas para ganar un poco de control, y al tener una caida exitosa esto provoca que se recargen tus munciones. \n\nEs un sistema frenetico que en primera instancia te invita a mirar las posiciones de los enemigos en pantalla, decidir tu estrategia r\u00e1pidamente y fomenta la administraci\u00f2n de recursos (tus balas) para conseguir tu objetivo, en cuestion de segundos. Obtener buenos combos te pueden proporcionar munici\u00f3n adicional o vida. \n\nLas \u00fanicas cosas que le tengo que criticar son superificales pudiendo ser pasadas por alto y son las siguientes:\n1. La gama de colores: El juego maneja un estilo muy particular, pero infortunadamente si eres como yo, esa combinaci\u00f3n de negro, rojo y blanco te va agotar la vista muy r\u00e1pidamente. Afortunadamente, es posible desbloquear diferentes estilos de paleta para poner la que sea m\u00e1s \"normal\" para tu vista.\n2.

Hopefully someone else out there did, because for me it was second perhaps only to the \u201cjump over cars with your fingers while looking out the backseat window\u201d game.  Any way, of course the floor wasn't actually lava. When you inevitably touched it you ideally didn't do so in a manner that caused injury.  That game is sort of what Japanese indie developer Moppin's Downwell is like.  Well, Downwell is actually a lot more entertaining although certainly not as physically exerting as climbing on furniture.\n\nYou play as a young man that has hopped down a very deep well.  There is a little more to it than that but it's best left unspoiled.  The well is procedurally generated and each area features different terrain and enemy types.  He is equipped with nothing other than a pair of gunboots, which are useful for destroying blocks, killing enemies, and slowing his fall.  As he makes his descent there are several different types of upgrades, alternate gunboot shots, and stat items to be found. \n\nThe key to Downwell is falling with style.  While you could cautiously make your way down the well, it isn't in the spirit of the game.  The player is encouraged to avoid touching the floor by instead bouncing off of enemies.  If you manage to chain sufficiently long combos, you will be rewarded with gems (the in game currency), health, and additional charges for your gunboots.  With practice it is possible to combo entire levels (and possibly the entire game) without ever touching the ground.  Shops and side caves have time bubbles at the entrance that allow you to preserve your combo even though you've technically hit the ground.  It all amounts to extremely fast-paced game play that will require all of your attention and reflexes.\n\nVisually, the game is simple but pleasing.  The default palette style's heavy emphasis on red and black reminded me of playing the Virtual Boy.  I liked it, but fortunately there are plenty of palette swap options in case it doesn't agree with you. On the default palette (which is the only one I used) it is very easy to tell which enemies you can land on and which ones you can't (bright red enemies).  It's good because it's important to be able to easily differentiate between them as you'll likely be moving at high speeds.\n\nDownwell is a great ride that left me wishing for more.  It's a short game that will only take a few hours to complete for most players, though there is a hard more that provides extra challenge.  The fact that it is procedurally generated adds a fair amount of replayability.  Although I would have liked to see more, all the content that's there is great.  Downwell is an outstanding game and at such a low price point you really can't go wrong with this one.  It's one of my favorite finds in recent history, and I'd recommend it to anyone that likes fast paced platforming action.\n\n[url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/25660729-CelerySpin/]Like the review?

So if you're a person who's into challenge - game is certainly for you. \n\nPros:\n 1) it's randomly generated, so you can't finish the game by just remembering exact path, and you have to actually learn how to beat enemies in different situations with different weapons - and you'll need to pick up different weapons to keep your life and charge up.\n2) enemies are diverse, as well as environments, they even change with difficulty too. all guns (10) are pretty effective if used right, so in that sense it's nicely balanced.\n3) overall difficulty is pretty great, so you can actually feel good about beating it, not like in 90% other games, where skill means next to nothing and it's all about repeating easy actions.\n4) 8-bit graphics are pretty nice and cute.\n\nNeutrals:\n1) music - i suppose to each his own, some may like it, some may not. it's a but depressing and repetitive, but atmospheric too, so can't really say it's bad thing.\n2) game \"skin\" changes - again, can't say that it's bad, i suppose it's good thing to be able to change colors of things around you, the only problem is, most of those colors are too bright and hurt eyes, so no one will use those anyway.. some of those are ok, some are really wierd.\n\nCons:\n1) as usual, cons are logical consequences of pros - so it's about being random. sure, stages themselves are ok, guns are balanced, enemes (with very rare exceptions) spawn so you actually can kill them without taking damage. but then there are upgrades after each stage - 20 of them in total, and you can pick only 1 out of random 3, and some of those upgrades are _way_ better than other. which turns game in luck based to some extent. \n2) if you don't like \"hit the wall\" in any game - maybe it's not for you, because in this game you certainly can. there are no saves, you have to run game through start to finish. it's not quite \"con\", but beware.\n\nSo in the end - even with some flaws, game is pretty solid and well-made, therefore deserves recommendation.", "timestamp_created": 1471053525, "timestamp_updated": 1471053525, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 37, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.788080", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24863326": {"recommendationid": "24863326", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045164841", "num_games_owned": 320, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 314, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509745273}, "language": "english", "review": "Never knew going Down-a-Well could be so fun", "timestamp_created": 1471043891, "timestamp_updated": 1471043891, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24860542": {"recommendationid": "24860542", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068765145", "num_games_owned": 135, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 453, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500249358}, "language": "english", "review": "Jason Bourne: \"Jesus Christ thats the Downwell kid!\"", "timestamp_created": 1471039595, "timestamp_updated": 1471039595, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498849", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24842997": {"recommendationid": "24842997", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046984546", "num_games_owned": 172, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2831, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508535968}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome game, a bit similar to Spelunky(another awesome game).

While the game seems very basic at first you'll quickly find the level of depth through combos, risk/reward siderooms, and the upgrade system which can cater to your personal playstyle. Every run is different because of the randomly generated levels that never seem too unfair or difficult. The game is difficult since you need to beat zone 1-5 without dying to truly beat the game and you only start with 4 health initially from the usual style. \n\nSpeaking of styles there's 5 total that are unlocked by your gem total after you win/die and are also excellent ways to play the game how you want it (more difficult? Easier to get combos? More health? Gun fanatic?). There are also unlockable palettes that change the visuals of the game, it's a welcomed cosmetic change and considering the game only works with four colors it's not too difficult to distinguish the red hurt barriers in each one, in addition to the DOWNWELL style my favorites are GLOW, AQUA, and VBOY. It took me 14 hours to 100% the game and I can honestly say that I had a lot of fun doing so and thought the additional mode was fairly challenging and fun.\n\nDefinitely pick this one up if you're either up for a challenge or if you want to try something brand new!", "timestamp_created": 1470356903, "timestamp_updated": 1470356903, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24714198": {"recommendationid": "24714198", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081534321", "num_games_owned": 294, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 359, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472361372}, "language": "english", "review": "If you want simple fun without a complex story, super in-depth mechanics, etc. this game is probably a good choice (especially for the low price).", "timestamp_created": 1470343219, "timestamp_updated": 1470343219, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24713655": {"recommendationid": "24713655", "author": {"steamid": "76561198114048481", "num_games_owned": 77, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 631, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1473022018}, "language": "english", "review": "A game...about going down a well...full of ghosts, skeletons, and eyeballs?", "timestamp_created": 1470340923, "timestamp_updated": 1470340923, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24710184": {"recommendationid": "24710184", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072619323", "num_games_owned": 322, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 584, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1471073147}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6ee1\u8111\u5b50\u90fd\u60f3\u7740\u9a9a\u64cd\u4f5c,\n\u6b8a\u4e0d\u77e5\u81ea\u5df1\u5df2\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e0d\u65ad[spoiler]\u5815[/spoiler]\u5760\u843d\u7684RBQ.", "timestamp_created": 1470327162, "timestamp_updated": 1470369365, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506062", "comment_count": "6", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24709307": {"recommendationid": "24709307", "author": {"steamid": "76561198161316612", "num_games_owned": 67, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 113, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487791088}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0418\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u043a\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0441! \u0418 \u0435\u0449\u0451, \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0431\u044b \u0434\u043e\u0431\u0430\u0432\u0442\u0435 \u0440\u0430\u043d\u0434\u043e\u043c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0440\u0435\u0436\u0438\u043c \u0432 \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043c \u0442\u0435\u0431\u0435 \u0434\u0430\u044e\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0440\u0430\u043d\u0434\u043e\u043c\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0432\u0435\u0449\u0438.", "timestamp_created": 1470323647, "timestamp_updated": 1470323647, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24703210": {"recommendationid": "24703210", "author": {"steamid": "76561198116585551", "num_games_owned": 134, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 978, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501916392}, "language": "english", "review": "It sure as hell didn't feel like 11 hours.

I cant imagine how successful this game would have been in the arcade. Its format and gameplay would have fit perfectly considering theres only 3 buttons; left, right, and jump/shoot. Also considering how addicting it is. \nThe game is very fast paced and takes some time to get good, so I'll give some tips. \n1. there are several upgrades that are quite useless. here are the ones you shouldn't get: \n- hot casing: Makes bullet casings do damage - pretty much useless, don't waste an upgrade on this. \n- Gem Sick: Gemhigh lasts for longer duration - since its pretty hard to lose your gemhigh anyway you won't be needing this. \n- Reverse Engineering: Lets you shoot a gun module to resuffle it once - after some time you will find a good weapon and you just wont end up using this one, because you'll like sticking to one particular gun. \n- Drone - This ones iffy. If you have a high RPM weapon like the Machingun or Noppy it can be usefull, but the most powerfull weapons, the shotgun and laser, dont shoot very fast so the drone will only shoot one bullet. \n- Rocket Jump: lift off - this one is iffy too. the main thing you want to be doing in the game is building a combo so you wont be touching the ground very often. \n2. These are the most important upgrades\n- Safety Jetpack- lets you float for a little while after running out of ammo. - this one is especially good for the laser and shotgun because they have low ammo capacities. \n- Blast module: creates an explosion after stomping on enemies - this one is what will mainly be damaging enemies. \n- Popping Gems: Shoots bullets upwards when you collect gems - If you also get Gem Attractor it can be very effective in getting the enemies that you miss. \n3. Get as much health as possible. \n- It took me a while to learn this but when you have full health and you get more hp it adds it to a little bar under you HP meter. Once you get 4 more hp at full health it permanently adds another HP to your Health. \n", "timestamp_created": 1469996439, "timestamp_updated": 1469996439, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24638962": {"recommendationid": "24638962", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074867492", "num_games_owned": 404, "num_reviews": 105, "playtime_forever": 37, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470000395}, "language": "english", "review": "Not bad.

[/spoiler]\n\n[b] The Negatives [/b]\n\n-Enemy A.I is horribly stupid; they have trouble navigating the terrain, never adopt new tactics, and generally are more like moving obstacles that minus HP instead of 'enemies'\n\n-There are few upgrades, with uses ranging from 'Hey, that was neat' to 'Do you even do anything at all?'\n\n-You always, and let me be clear, [u] ALWAYS [/u] have to start from area 1-1, meaning you'll be seeing the same thing over and over\n\n-The most fun way to play the game, aka [spoiler] going way too fast [/spoiler] is frowned upon because of the way the game design is, however the boring way to play, aka [spoiler] going way too slow and careful [/spoiler] is the only way to actually make progress. It isn't fun.\n\n-The higher majority of the color pallettes hurt my eyes\n\n-The music is forgettable and not worth leaving on\n\n-The player is not given any real direction or given any reason to play the game\n\n-The game frequently switches between telling you everything you need to know and telling you nothing, making pacing look like the difficulty spike of a NFS game\n\n-Those bats are the worst thing ever, seriously.\n\n-They use the 'one more go' formula to pad game length out, or at least that's what it looks like to me\n\n-Unstompable enemies in a game where stomping enemies is efficient and lots of fun\n\n-Said unstompable enemies really enjoy spawning under you, as well as spawning next to other stompable enemies\n\n-It's never really clear whether or not an enemy can be stomped on\n\n-Enemy design is poor and uncreative\n\n-Level design is poor and uncreative\n\n-For randomly generated levels, they all sure do look and feel the same\n\n-Side rooms never have anything special in them\n\n-Some elements are introduced without the player being told or shown them, such a spike traps that you could not tell were spike traps\n\n-Enemies cannot trigger said traps\n\n-Not enough gunboot types\n\n[b] The Positives [/b]\n\n-When you have a successful run, going really really fast and doing so without taking damage, being super professional and the likes, it's fun.\n\n-The whole idea of it is really good, although poorly executed\n\n-Gunboots\n\n[h1] Rating: 4/10 [/h1]\n[b] Although having a very good idea behind it, Downwell's cons extremely outweigh the pros. I really can't wait to see what else this developer has in store, and whether or not they'll improve on their mistakes.\n\nI sure hope so.

Game [/h1]\nDownwell is the famous retro platformer game with perma-death features and some rogue-lite factors that everyone been talking about ever since it was released.\n\nYou probably saw so many youtubers playing/talking about this game, as well as they should because it really is such a unique style of a game with a perfect retro feeling.\n\nI don't want to get into too much detail, almost everyone knows about this game its popular enough\n\n[h1]But FPS issues[/h1]\nhere is what they don't tell you.\nYou are 80% most likely to have a serious FPS drop issue with the game no matter how good your specs are.\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/app/360740/discussions/search/?q=FPS&gidforum=481115363874629127&include_deleted=1&p=1] SteamDiscussion\t[/url]\nClick there to reveal the discussion area with a \"Fps\" filter on it and see how many people are having fps issues.\n\nThe game gives fps drops when there are too many enemies and explosion animations on screen, but it goes from 60 to maybe 55 minimum which is all good with me, but if you get hit it goes down to 47 and sometimes lower.\n[b]HOWEVER[/b]\nApparently according to the developer the FPS dropping when you're hit is an intended effect to give the old retro \"slowdown\" effect when you get damaged \"I am not still 100% convinced by that response\", that still does not excuse the FPS drop when there are too many explosion and enemies on screen.\n\n[b] Note [/b] \nThe fps issue happened to me in the following systems.\ncorei5 4gb ram gt635m laptop \ncorei5overclocked, 8gbram r9 290x desktop \nand with my friend's pc having a gtx980\n\n[h1] Dev response [/h1] \nThe developer has responded that he/she wont be able to provide any fix whatsoever because he/she is working alone on the mobile port, so it might take a long time to see a fix for this.\n\nAs for me luckily I got to play the game for about 2 hours when I didn't have internet connection and now steam has recorded less than 1 hour for me, I will not cross the 2 hour timer because I really would like to refund the game if they never try to fix this, I know the game is cheap and all but I really don't like buying something that is broken and wont be fixed.\n\n\n[h1]TL;DR[/h1]\nGreat game if it weren't for the FPS issues, know that you might not get the same issue so you can always buy it play and refund it if you did, the download size is only 34mb so it should be fairly simple to do that.", "timestamp_created": 1467605532, "timestamp_updated": 1467606687, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0,

Despite this being also released on mobile, you would not believe how much it outclassed standard smartphone crap.  Rather, Downwell is pure of form and purpose with a simple 3-input control method (left, right, and a jump/shoot button) so it wouldn't be too hard to translate those few inputs to a touchscreen.  But that's neither here nor there, get a controller for this game and buckle up.\n\nDownwell is a fast game where you'll have to be able to react to random situations quickly to have a chance of finishing it at all... and that's before you unlock Hard Mode.  You can only shoot while in the air, and only down.  You can also kill enemies by stomping on them, which refills your ammo just like landing on ground.  Some enemies must be shot, while others must be stomped, and most are either/or.  You can slow your descent a bit with the recoil of your shots like in Vectorman, but that drains valuable ammo just to give you a bit more control.  There are some extra nuances like a combo system than penalizes you for landing and a not-so-hidden wall jump but that's the gist of it.  The game is randomly generated of course, forcing you to make these decisions on the fly and sometimes dealing you a pretty hard hand.\n\nAll the fluff and \"features\" that could dampen or otherwise ruin the experience have been cut out.  This game is as pure and focused as anything to come out of an 80's arcade cabinet like Joust or Centipede, and it even has the same overall aspect ratio.  Downwell is maddeningly addictive, and I have no doubt it would've gobbled up many quarters if it came out back in that day.  Games like these often seem like something you fully understand in 5 minutes, except it takes you a few more hours to even realize the subtle nuances and strategies you can, and in some cases must, develop in order to see the end of the game.  That's a beautiful thing.\n\nGood:\n-A simple concept that you can pick up and play immediately\n-Very clear art that leaves no ambiguity\n-Options to change palletes for funsies\n-Different gameplay altering styles to suit playstyle preference\n-Just difficult enough, punishingly fast but nothing you can't handle with practice\n-Randomized for replay value\n-Solid in-game timer for speedruns\n\nBad:\n-Some alternate palletes are much harder to see, making them useless features that add fake difficulty\n-The soundtrack is pretty abyssmal, but you have the option to disable music entirely and play your own\n-Full Screen doesn't work properly in Windows 10, forcing you to jump through some hoops getting it running in windowed mode.\n", "timestamp_created": 1467511221,

But it may have cost me my sanity. \n\nAmorphous shadows seemed to lurk in the darker recesses of the weed-choked hollow and to flit as in some blasphemous ceremonial procession past the portals of the mouldering tombs in the hillside; shadows which could not have been cast by that pallid, peering crescent moon. I constantly consulted my watch by the light of my electric lantern, and listened with feverish anxiety at the receiver of the telephone; but for more than a quarter of an hour heard nothing. Then a faint clicking came from the instrument, and I called down to my friend in a tense voice. Apprehensive as I was, I was nevertheless unprepared for the words which came up from that uncanny vault in accents more alarmed and quivering than any I had heard before from Harley Warren. He who had so calmly left me a little while previously, now called from below in a shaky whisper more portentous than the loudest shriek:\n     \u201cGod! If you could see what I am seeing!\u201d\n     I could not answer. Speechless, I could only wait. Then came the frenzied tones again:\n     \u201cCarter, it\u2019s terrible\u2014monstrous\u2014unbelievable!\u201d\n     This time my voice did not fail me, and I poured into the transmitter a flood of excited questions. Terrified, I continued to repeat, \u201cWarren, what is it? What is it?\u201d\n     Once more came the voice of my friend, still hoarse with fear, and now apparently tinged with despair:\n     \u201cI can\u2019t tell you, Carter! It\u2019s too utterly beyond thought\u2014I dare not tell you\u2014no man could know it and live\u2014Great God! I never dreamed of THIS!\u201d Stillness again, save for my now incoherent torrent of shuddering inquiry. Then the voice of Warren in a pitch of wilder consternation:\n     \u201cCarter! for the love of God, put back the slab and get out of this if you can! Quick!\u2014leave everything else and make for the outside\u2014it\u2019s your only chance! Do as I say, and don\u2019t ask me to explain!\u201d\n     I heard, yet was able only to repeat my frantic questions. Around me were the tombs and the darkness and the shadows; below me, some peril beyond the radius of the human imagination. But my friend was in greater danger than I, and through my fear I felt a vague resentment that he should deem me capable of deserting him under such circumstances. More clicking, and after a pause a piteous cry from Warren:\n     \u201cBeat it! For God\u2019s sake, put back the slab and beat it, Carter!\u201d\n     Something in the boyish slang of my evidently stricken companion unleashed my faculties. I formed and shouted a resolution, \u201cWarren, brace up! I\u2019m coming down!\u201d But at this offer the tone of my auditor changed to a scream of utter despair:\n     \u201cDon\u2019t! You can\u2019t understand! It\u2019s too late\u2014and my own fault. Put back the slab and run\u2014there\u2019s nothing else you or anyone can do now!\u201d The tone changed again, this time acquiring a softer quality, as of hopeless resignation. Yet it remained tense through anxiety for me.\n     \u201cQuick\u2014before it\u2019s too late!\u201d I tried not to heed him; tried to break through the paralysis which held me, and to fulfil my vow to rush down to his aid. But his next whisper found me still held inert in the chains of stark horror.\n     \u201cCarter\u2014hurry! It\u2019s no use\u2014you must go\u2014better one than two\u2014the slab\u2014\u201d A pause, more clicking, then the faint voice of Warren:\n     \u201cNearly over now\u2014don\u2019t make it harder\u2014cover up those damned steps and run for your life\u2014you\u2019re losing time\u2014 So long, Carter\u2014won\u2019t see you again.\u201d Here Warren\u2019s whisper swelled into a cry; a cry that gradually rose to a shriek fraught with all the horror of the ages\u2014\n     \u201cCurse these hellish things\u2014legions\u2014 My God! Beat it! Beat it! Beat it!\u201d\n     After that was silence. I know not how many interminable aeons I sat stupefied; whispering, muttering, calling, screaming into that telephone. Over and over again through those aeons I whispered and muttered, called, shouted, and screamed, \u201cWarren! Warren! Answer me\u2014are you there?\u201d\n     And then there came to me the crowning horror of all\u2014the unbelievable, unthinkable, almost unmentionable thing. I have said that aeons seemed to elapse after Warren shrieked forth his last despairing warning, and that only my own cries now broke the hideous silence. But after a while there was a further clicking in the receiver, and I strained my ears to listen. Again I called down, \u201cWarren, are you there?\u201d, and in answer heard the thing which has brought this cloud over my mind. I do not try, gentlemen, to account for that thing\u2014that voice\u2014nor can I venture to describe it in detail, since the first words took away my consciousness and created a mental blank which reaches to the time of my awakening in the hospital. Shall I say that the voice was deep; hollow; gelatinous; remote; unearthly; inhuman; disembodied? What shall I say? It was the end of my experience, and is the end of my story.

If you want a game with very simple, tightly designed mechanics that rewards practice and mastery, this is for you. The only complaint that I have, and it's a relatively small complaint, is that the rewards you gain for racking up combos don't scale far enough in my personal opinion. As you descend dow nthis hellish well, armed only with a pair of gun-boots, you get rewards if you can kill enough enemies in a row without landing. If you get a combo of 8 or more, you get 100 gems, at 14 or more, you get an extra charge, and at 25 or more, you get an extra life, but it stops there. I once racked up a combo of 152 and was mildly let down to realize that it gave me the exact same rewards as a combo of 25. I wish that the game could encourage mastery even further by giving in-game rewards for pulling off insanely high combos, even if they scaled very slowly. Shame, but at the same time, it's a small complaint, especially considering how much fun I have with this game. The fact that there's a hard mode and various modes and pallettes to unlock appeals to my inner completionist and if you're the sort of person who enjoys unlocking all the little extras in a game, you'll enjoy it too.

I bought it on sale for $1.50 and it was worth every penny!  Even if it was for $15.00, it would still have been quite worth it!  \n\nOnly three buttons are required to play. Two to move, and one to jump and use gunboots.  It says that it is controller-capable, but it seems not to work for me, but just using a normal keyboard is just fine.  \n\nThe goal of the game is to go as far down into the well as possible, jumping, and shooting bad guys as you descend down.  As you get gems from killing enemies and breaking blocks, you will progress to get new palattes (new colors for the game), and new styles (how you walk, and how much health or upgrades you get.)\n\nOne thing that I noticed when I bought the game,  was that I first found it to be boring.  I didn't know how fun the game could be once you begin playing.\n\nMy favorite part of the game, would be when you get to a \"resting spot\" in the game.  There are time circles by which, when you enter, time stops, and you can take a break, rest your fingers, get a powerup, and continue your journey.  It all seems like an old 16-bit game until you reach a place like that!\n\nThere are multiple areas, containing three levels each, progressing in difficulty.  Between each level, you will be given an option to upgrade your character.  In the resting spots, you will either find a shop, gun module, or gem stack.  You can spend your gems that you have collected to buy health or charge.  And, even if you spend gems, they will still we added to your total amount. \n\nThank you for reading this review, and I hope you will be playing Downwell soon!", "timestamp_created": 1465307251, "timestamp_updated": 1465307251, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23430413": {"recommendationid": "23430413", "author": {"steamid": "76561198126649412", "num_games_owned": 95, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 437, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507182490}, "language": "spanish", "review": "exelente juego perfecto para cuando no tienes mucho tiempo y quieres jugar algo", "timestamp_created": 1465280506, "timestamp_updated": 1465280506, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23419605": {"recommendationid": "23419605", "author": {"steamid": "76561198258136837", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 4781, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512905909}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc911\ub3c5\uc131 \uc788\uace0 \ub2a5\ub825\uce58\ub97c \uc62c\ub824\uc11c \uc800\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \uac8c \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c 1\ud310 \ub05d\ub098\uba74 \ucd08\uae30\ud654\ub418\uc11c \uc2a4\ub9b4 \uc788\uc74c \ucd94\ucc9c", "timestamp_created": 1465226613, "timestamp_updated": 1465226613, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23416347": {"recommendationid": "23416347", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119464583", "num_games_owned": 120, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 367, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480213698}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a very simple rouguelike game, but it is very addictive.

In fact there are so many perfect things about Downwell's design that I'm not even going to pretend at giving this review any structure, I'm just going to enumerate them in semi random order.\n\nControls are tight and responsive. Don't be fooled, this is no phone game port. This belongs on PC.\n\nThe juice: gun blasts, recoil, bouncing on enemies, destroying blocks and crates, sucking up gems - all of it feels very right, with the aid of meaty visual and sound effects.\n\nThe decision to have shops and caves in a time warp, so you can enter them safely and pause your current combo.\n\nCombos, by the way. I didn't even know about them till reaching the end game, and once I'd got that far, starting again from level 1 was made more interesting because now I would challenge myself by going for combos, in effect making the game as hard or as easy as I wanted. Combos are rewarded with health, but you often lose health in the act of trying to get a combo. WHAT A CONUNDRUM. It's a tempting and addictive risk to ones health, with euphoric highs and damaging, rueful lows, like gambling, or class A drugs.\n\nThis whole game is as addictive as a class A drug, by the way. Once you find out about hard mode you're like, fuck that, I'll just complete normal then I'm done with this game. I completed normal mode hours ago. Still playing. \n\nNone of the mechanics are taught via tutorial, instead they're learnt IN A REAL WORLD SCENARIO, and each time you grasp a new mechanic, it fundamentally changes how you approach your next playthrough. Starting from the beginning again is never boring.\n\nThe game is short: you will lose or complete a playthrough within about 30 minutes. So you know you can sit down and enjoy for short bursts. Or not.\n\nWeapons. When you first play the game you think you've figured out which of them are great and which garbage, and you decide to just avoid changing weapons after you've picked up your favourite. Then you learn that each time you swap your weapon you get a health or ammo bonus. That is devilishly ingenious design.\n\nThe best plot in video game history.\n\nOh, and each level 'trains' you to play progressively better and faster. Like the 2nd level's introducing spikes encourages you to be nimble on your feet. The 3rd is underwater, meaning you have to fall faster to save drowning. The 4th removes safe land entirely, so you're just falling and falling. Then you realise you can play in that same manner in the first level, dodging floors, stomping skulls, racking up the combos. feeling like a boss.\n\nThe randomised upgrades at the end of each stage add some variety and experimentation to each playthrough, though they are balanced enough that the order you receive them in changes the end game little, so you do not have to rely on luck.\n\nThere are different character traits to pick at the start which have their own strengths and weakness, some oriented to specific playstyles. Some are better for beginners; others great for experts. All useful, all worth experimenting with.\n\nSome cons: wall jumps could be much easier to pull off, and unlockable colour palettes are just a gimmick and I can't imagine anyone playing with anything other than the default style and maybe a couple of others.\n\nThose are all the cons.\n\nThere are probably hundreds of other little perfections about this game that I either haven't noticed or can't remember off the top of my head.

Although, one complaint is that the character's body becomes a little lost in a swarm of bats and other white creatures; but, that's probably where the twitch-reflex would come in.", "timestamp_created": 1464354969, "timestamp_updated": 1464355054, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23231887": {"recommendationid": "23231887", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046528648", "num_games_owned": 1462, "num_reviews": 115, "playtime_forever": 25, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1464344030}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8282\u594f\u5f88\u5feb\uff0c\u5374\u6ca1\u6709\u4ec0\u4e48\u723d\u5feb\u611f\u2026\u2026", "timestamp_created": 1464344120, "timestamp_updated": 1464344120, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498125", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23227519": {"recommendationid": "23227519", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118982257", "num_games_owned": 191, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1840, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512180395}, "language": "english", "review": "MLG palette simulator 2016", "timestamp_created": 1464315285, "timestamp_updated": 1464315285, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23220022": {"recommendationid": "23220022", "author": {"steamid": "76561198105345816", "num_games_owned": 232, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 165, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500684548}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Ta wapo ni\u00f1o", "timestamp_created": 1464278573, "timestamp_updated": 1464278573, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23211129": {"recommendationid": "23211129", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036203696", "num_games_owned": 168, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 205, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472692485}, "language": "english", "review": "Please, oh, PLEASE!

It's simple, challenging and so much fun. Its got a retro artstyle some great music and it's kind of relaxing to play not in that its super laid back (It's hard as balls) but it will make you concentrate on it and make it so you can tune out and simply make quick decisions without thinking because there is nothing at stake and nothing to worry about but getting deeper. I don't know how the idea for this game was thought of  but nether the less it's great, who keow falling down a well would be so much fun? \nThe enemies are satisfying to kill and killing them is rewarding because it allows you to get gems easily. \nThe game does a great job of not being punishing while still being challenging there aren't really that many moments where I thought my death was unfair. \nThe controller works really well with this game. It's responsive and makes the game a little bit easier to play\nI really love how i can switch the palettes im using and how all the palettes all fit the game great. The palletes are a great reward system for playing it's fun to unlock them just to see what the next one will look like.\nThe game also doesnt give you a solid tutorial it tells you the controls and then you are left to control your little character with no guidance and no goal.\n\nSome of the only problems i can really think about are ones to do with the power up system because a lot of the gun parts that are given to you through the game can activly make the game harder to play. Also because it's procedurly generated you will occasionally see an enemy stuck in a wall but this doesn't really affect the game on any major level. \n\nThis game is so much fun to play when im laying in bed unable to think of something to do, it gives me something to play when i cant think of anything to play, it's a game I can return to just to unlock a new pallette when im bored.

Todas as armas s\u00e3o \u00fateis de alguma forma e promovem variadas formas de jogar. Acumuladas, as gemas deixam o personagem mais forte durante a partida e somam n\u00fameros para destravar estilos de jogabilidade e paletas de cores para a interface.\n\nO jogo n\u00e3o realmente precisa, mas tem tradu\u00e7\u00e3o competente para PT-BR.\n\nMas...

Ao abater uma quantidade de inimigos, explos\u00f5es com a anima\u00e7\u00e3o do t\u00fanel podem confundir o jogador em rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 posi\u00e7\u00e3o do personagem jog\u00e1vel.

Absolutely worth the price they are offering it for.  It would be worth 50 times the price if there was an easy mode.  Game play is fun, just as shown in the preview.  Lots of different weapons which affect game play.  It reminds me of the old monochrome PC pitfall games (not to be confused with the pitfall games for SNES and SEGA).   There appears to be lots of stategies for playing also, you can avoid enemies for speed running, or try and kill them all to collect gems.\n\nThe difficulty level is not something I normally complain about with games, but in this case the speed of the game detracts from the overall experience for me.   I enjoy difficult games, but I prefer that they build to the difficulty.  This game starts off with a significant level of difficulty and builds to what I would consider impossible game play (at least for myself).\n\nIn this case the game could be more accessible to casual gamers, if slower game play was available, or if it built to the difficulty in a more methodical manner.  While the random level generation keeps the replays fresh, it doesn't create enough novelty to practice the same levels repeatedly for an untalented gamer to get to them.  It may not be a loot grinder, but I would classify it as a practice grinder.\n\nIts a good game, but the without a difficulty setting, the casual gamer is just buying the first two levels (1-1 to 2-4).  If you are committed I'm sure you'll get further, but the amount of novelty in the game is not engaging enough to entice me to practice enough to see what the later levels look like.   I like the game enough that I feel bad leaving criticism, but I think this game is good enough, it can handle it, and perhaps it can take it and make itself even better.\n\nI am very satisfied with what I got out of the game and I whole-heartedly recommend it.

Who knows. Perhaps the better question is why you decided to sleep with your gunboots on in the first place (doesn't seem safe, but neither does jumping down a well. Whatever).\n\nNow that we have the bulk of the story out of the way, Downwell is a retro-style (pixel art) game where you're falling down a procedurally-generated well with only your \"gunboots\" to protect you.\n\nWhile the concept of dodging objects/creatures while falling isn't particularly new, Downwell's mechanics make this game unique and worthwhile. The gunboots have a limited charge that refills everytime you land on something (enemy, ground, object). The gunboots the dual purpose of destroying things and slowing your descent, allowing you to somewhat navigate through the obstacles.\n\nIf the increasingly large, diverse number of enemies and traps don't keep you entertained for awhile, Downwell has a variety of content that adds to the replayability.\n  -  The gunboot upgrades grant you some variety, including: Shotgun, Machinegun, Burst, Laser, etc.\n  -  Random caves where time is frozen - contain bonuses like gunboot upgrades, gems, health recovery, etc.\n  -  A shopkeeper that exchanges gems for items that increase your health or max gunboot charge.\n  -  Different color pallettes are unlockable by collecting gems, including: VBOY (all red), Nuclear (green), etc.\n  -  Different starting stats (gameplay styles) unlockable by collecting gems.\n  -  Randomized upgrades after you complete a section of the well, including: Drones, exploding corpses, and heart balloons.\n\nOverall, Downwell is a very, very well-made game with a lot of replayability.\nThe only drawbacks are: it's hard (that's a given) and it gets tedious/repetitive if you play it for a few hours straight, but it's fun again after a short break. :)", "timestamp_created": 1462761091, "timestamp_updated": 1462761091, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505547", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22873419": {"recommendationid": "22873419", "author": {"steamid": "76561197988742738", "num_games_owned": 173, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 626, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468790911}, "language": "english", "review": "What- you're used to platformers that go to the right?\n\nPffft.\n\nHold on to your pants, because this one of a kind platformer \n\nONLY\n\nGOES\n\nDOWN\n\nBuy this game- on sale or not.

You get gun upgrades as you travel down the well and power-ups at the end of each stage. Stages gradually get more dificult and add more elements the further you go down. I've only reached the third area so far but everytime I die it gives me more of a push to see if I can do better.

There are plenty of upgrades for the gunboots, upgrades in randomized shop locations, perks obtainable at the end of a level (everything from a balloon to a drone, and even the ability to stop time!), and even new unlockable game modes to keep each playthrough fresh and exciting, albeit frustrating, as is the nature in rogue-likes. \n\nThe game runs at a very fast pace right from the beginning, and is only more unforgiving as you descend further. With luck and practice, however, I have found downwell to be very rewarding. No matter how far down you get, the gems you collect along the way count towards unlockables, often giving you new game modes to better fit your playstyle. \n\nAesthetically, I'm a big fan. Retro but not corny, new palates are unlocked to change the color from the default red. Palates range from simple blue and green, to throwbacks such as the original gameboy and visualboy. Soundtrack is very fitting, but nothing to gawk at.\n\nOverall, I would absolutely recommend this game at any price!

You always shoot downwards and you have a clip which reloads if you touch the ground or stomp on enemies. Gems from enemies are needed for the gemhigh. Gemhigh boosts your damage and range with all weapons. Runs out, if you don't collect more gems. Gems are also needed to buy more HP and bigger clip size at shops.\n\nA lot of extra rooms on the sides for more weapons which also always give you +1 HP or +2 clip size.\nSome enemies only can be stomped, some can only be shot. Going into rooms stops time, so you don't have to break your combo and you have an easy way to get back into the action. Combos (killing enemies without touching the ground) gives you rewards which add up.\n8    +100 gems\n13  +1 clip size\n16  +1 HP\n\nIt's an awesome feeling to rush down at high speed and own the enemies with awesome BLAMBLAM WAM KABLOOM.

The entire idea behind this game is extremely simple yet somehow satisfying when it all comes together.\n\nWell the story is that you're playing as a person who jumps into a very deep well trying to find the cat that dived in right before you, why? Who knows; but with these kinds of games it's best not to ask questions.\n\nNow the story may not be very deep, but the gameplay is top notch; you simply fall from the start of the stage to the end with nothing but your reflexes and trusty Gunboots to help you out. Downwell has four stages, each with three levels and as you progress through the stages the enemies start to get more complex. Add onto that, procedural generation so no two runs should end up exactly the same making it fresh each time. As you beat levels you get to choose one of three upgrades for your character and in each stage you'll come across a shop that sells the player healing items or upgrades for gems. You'll quickly realise that to get further easier you'll need to buy items from these shops, but to get a large amount of gems at once you need to get killstreaks without touching the ground to gain a 'Gemhigh'. This is where the game will start to really shine, at first it's as simple as falling down and reaching the end while stomping on a few enemies but you'll come to wonder \"how do I do all this without touching the ground?\". Now this is the part where the Gunboots come into play, if there's no enemy directly under you but there is slightly above your horizontal position you can move above him by shooting your Gunboots a couple times. Every time you stomp on an enemies head it will refill your ammo so you can maintain your Gunboots, at first this is really difficult but you'll get the hang of it after a while and it starts to get insanely fun. Also when you want to enter a shop you don't have to worry about your combo because it's in a 'time bubble' so your combo stays the moment you touch the floor next to the shops entrance but you'll have to jump out of it to maintain your combo.\n\nOn top of all that you can earn unlocks by just getting gems, you'll start to get colour pallets and different playstyles to fool around with. There's also a hard mode to beat once you finish the normal game, it's basically a lot more enemes thrown at you so you can actually get a higher combo easier. This game has some small quirks that the developer left for the player to find out about, one of them being wall-jumping.\n\nReally enjoyed the graphics, I love pixel art in any game and this game is no exception. It gives you that retro vibe and even has some old throw-back colour pallets some people might like. With all that said though, some might despise the graphics; which is fine. Pixel art isn't for everyone, but it does add to the experience for this title.\n\nThe soundtrack does not disappoint, some of the tracks are chiptune so again not everyone will enjoy it but the music does help for setting the stage for a strange yet epic journey into the depths below.\n\nWould I recommend this to everyone? Not necessarily, at first it can be challenging if you're not used to platformers; throw in the Gunboots and a 'don't touch the ground' mindset and it can be a lot to handle at once. But it is very cheap and you should be able to get a few hours out of it, so why not just add it to your cart the next time you buy something cheap as a little extra.", "timestamp_created": 1461039196, "timestamp_updated": 1461039196, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22503872": {"recommendationid": "22503872", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074280098", "num_games_owned": 147, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 3949, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 52, "last_played": 1513546324}, "language": "english", "review": "Pros:\n-Fast, furious, fun.\n-YOU HAVE GUNS.

Every aspect is carefully and artfully executed. Each component of the experience exists in perfect harmony with the whole. It is unique, addictive, irresistable, and an absolute joy to play. The controls are so tight and responsive that the mere act of moving about becomes fun. The difficulty level is punishingly hard, yet somehow inviting, with a well balanced skill-curve. Game design students should have to study Downwell.\n\nThe concept of the game is brilliantly simple. You get 3 buttons: left, right, and a trigger for your gunboots. You fall down a procedurally generated well, stomping/shooting monsters, and collecting gems and precious upgrades that improve your chances of survival. And from from this deceptively simple mechanic, a rich gaming experience unfolds, like the petals of an onion. Gradually, the priority shifts from just making it far down the well as possible, to doing it in style. Once you realize how the mechanics work, and start stringing together combos that in some cases can even span multiple levels (!), the game takes on a new level of enjoyment. This is the kind of game that makes you feel like a ninja once you get a groove going, bouncing from one enemy to the next.\n\nDownwell brings me to a place of gaming happiness that many recent games (even truly great ones) fail to even approach. If you appreciate 2D game design as an artform, or if you just enjoy tough-as-nails platformers with deliciously responsive controls, you owe it to yourself to play this game immediately.\n\nI consider Downwell to be an All-Time-Top-5 platforming game, even though the objective actually involves avoiding the platforms.", "timestamp_created": 1460821950, "timestamp_updated": 1460822045, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.578000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22440043": {"recommendationid": "22440043", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047905646", "num_games_owned": 289, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 109, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509974525}, "language": "english", "review": "This is the only game my wife will play while pregnant, and I have a very good selection in my library.\n\nWell done.", "timestamp_created": 1460764062, "timestamp_updated": 1460764062, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22439633": {"recommendationid": "22439633", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050285319", "num_games_owned": 194, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2955, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507522079}, "language": "english", "review": "Surprisingly addictive with lots of different play styles to choose from.

This is one of those games that everyone highly recommends: it's cheap, it's easy to play, and it's addicting as hell.\n\nThe graphics are very simple, with multiple color palettes that can be unlocked by leveling up. The soundtrack is pretty good as well, but it never gets memorable. But the gameplay... it's nearly perfect: you keep falling down a well through different areas filled with enemies and side caves that contain shops and upgrades. And the controls are responsive and easy: when in the air you press the jump button to shoot bullets from your boots. [b]This is the entire game.[/b] And it never gets boring, it is never frustratingly hard, and it is always fun to play.\n\nOverall, a really quick and fun game to play for 10 minutes (or 2 hours) a day that never gets tiring.

You know what I mean? Like when you play traditional games on a PC, console, or even hand held systems, you still have a complete substantial experience. But when you play a game on your phone, it always feels like an incomplete, dumbed down experience. I suppose my feelings about mediocre and insubstantial games that the App Store has become oversaturated with can be entirely attributed to the plague known as micro-transactions. I could go on about how micro-transactions are cheap and disgusting or how they create badly designed games that feel insubstantial, even after they're done sucking all the cash out of your wallet.\n\nBut you're probably wondering what all of this has to do with Downwell, a 2D platformer where you play as a guy with guns on the bottom of his boots who is (you guessed it) descending down a well. Well, the reason I brought it up is because I haven't been playing the Steam version a lot because I've mainly been playing the excellent mobile version and I've just noticed that saying \"well\" two times in a row at the beginning of this sentence was probably a bit uncomfortable to read. \"Well\" I don't give a shit. Anyway joking aside, it's a rare treat to play a mobile game that actually feels like a real and complete experience with no micro-transaction bullshit that makes you pay for content that should already be included with the game. Now, I haven't seen the face of God yet but the fact that I can say that about an iPhone game is pretty solid proof that one exists.\n\nBut that alone isn't the only reason I like Downwell, it's actually a pretty well designed and balanced game with challenging, addictive gameplay thats topped off by a charming retro aesthetic. As I mentioned in the last paragraph, the main gameplay mechanic is that you can shoot guns on your boots that will kill enemies beneath you and the kick back from the guns will propel you up a tiny bit. Which the second part is actually quite important since you'll be falling pretty fast and you'll need to control your fall so you don't land on something that will kill you. The fact that you can only get hit 4 times before dying encourages a cautious descent.\n\nBut don't worry cause you can upgrade your health. While we're on the subject of upgrades, there are plenty of them for your character and your guns which gives the gameplay a bit of variety. But while you will only ever use less than half of the character upgrades, the weapon upgrades are pretty balanced. Each one well suits a different type of play style and the game encourages experimentation by occasionally, having randomly selected weapon upgrades restore health as well. So it forces you to switch things up if you need the health.\n\nAs for the enemies, some of them are white and some are red. Red enemies can't be jumped on at all and can only be shot with your guns. But white enemies can be jumped on Mario style but have red paint on their asses because you'll get hurt if they attack while you're underneath them. Which they will do sometimes because if you fall past an enemy, they will chase you down for a bit and try to attack you. But it's only a few seconds before they get bored and stop like they have an unusually short attention span or maybe they went to the same academy all the police in Grand Theft Auto 4 trained at.\n\nYou know now that I think about it, the gun-boots mechanic would be really annoying if you had to collect ammo for your guns. But luckily it all works quite well because you can't run out of bullets. However, the game avoids becoming too easy because you can only shoot the bullets that are loaded in your gun's clip until you land on a platform or jump on an enemy which causes your guns to automatically reload. This creates a nice gameplay balance where you have to conserve the bullets in your clip to control your fall, but is still fair by always allowing you the same amount of limited control with every fall.\n\nThat is why the game is challenging but never unfair, because it follows a specific set of rules that never changes. And let me tell you this game is challenging. The next thing I'm going to say might sound like a deal breaker but let me explain why it isn't. Downwell isn't only reminiscent of the NES because of it's aesthetic and challenging gameplay but also because every time you die, you start the whole game over again! Fun fun fun!\n\nBut wait! This aspect of the game isn't the rage inducing nightmare you probably think it is right now. If most games did this, they would be horribly un engaging. But every time you start a new game the levels are still the same but the layout of the levels are randomly generated which ensures the game is constantly engaging by never getting stale. I believe this element of the game not only adds to it's replayability but also makes the game feel a lot longer than it actually is. Because the game isn't very long and with mid-level check points you would breeze through it in a single Sunday afternoon.\n\nBut like Dark Souls, Downwell is the good kind of difficult that keeps the experience engaging and fresh from beginning to end. Well I assume to the end because I haven't finished the damn game yet, probably never will. And again like Dark Souls, it's not the rage quit kind of difficulty, it's the kind that makes you want to try again and again until you finally get to the next level.

There doesn\u2019t need to be anymore colours or objects added to the game, as they will distract you. It\u2019s perfect. It conveys all it needs to, without overdoing or under doing it.\n\nThe sound design is spot on. Each weapon has their own unique and distinct sound to them, and the way their sound changes when you get a gem high, which increases the weapons power and range, genuinely makes them feel unstoppable.\n\nThe soundtrack is also so fitting with the theme of the game. Each level is themed differently, and the music adds to the atmosphere of each level. It\u2019s not too overbearing or too simple, but they are all very memorable.\n\nAll in all, it\u2019s hard to find a game on Steam that offers this much for this little, and the fact that the game is only a mere 32mb in size blows me away every, single, time.\n\nGet this game as soon as you can.\n\nNo, buy it right now!", "timestamp_created": 1460541049, "timestamp_updated": 1460541049, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22387526": {"recommendationid": "22387526", "author": {"steamid": "76561198148759766", "num_games_owned": 205, "num_reviews": 65, "playtime_forever": 186, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1460863033}, "language": "english", "review": "Go down and shoot things.", "timestamp_created": 1460515046, "timestamp_updated": 1460515046, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488831", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22381730": {"recommendationid": "22381730", "author": {"steamid": "76561198257035916", "num_games_owned": 16, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 579, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474998246}, "language": "english", "review": "I would really enjoy this game a lot... if I could play it for more than 20 seconds at a time!\nIt might work on a lot of computers, but forme I keep getting FATAL ERRORS when it tries to do some shaders.

A simple game at it\u2019s core, it tasks the player with guiding the nameless (as far as I\u2019m concerned) hero down a series of randomly generated mineshafts in an attempt to attain unbelievable riches in the form of gems and kill The Boss while at it. Why exactly are we doing all this is never explained, and frankly does not matter, as \u201cDownwell\u201d is a twitch platformer and getting better is really all there is to it.\n\t\nThe game presents us with a bare-bones platforming mechanics, where we are able to run left or right and jump, and also fire our weapon called Gunboots. They shoot straight down and can be modified by a few different pickups that can be found in the caverns. They also have limited ammo which recharges when we touch the ground or stomp an enemy, which in turn is a mechanic essential to pulling out combos. Those give us bonus gems, and gems are\u2026 well, they are shiny and worth a lot. They also allow us to buy things in the occasional shop, sometimes boost firepower, and unlock styles (which modify the game in different ways) and palettes persistently, even when we fail in our quest (hence the \u201crougelite\u201d element). All this makes up for a simple and yet solid mechanical makeup of the game. Dying is common, but it\u2019s all skill-based and I almost never feel as though I was killed off randomly.\n\t\nMinimalistic pixel art style works well for \u201cDownwell\u201d, as it makes discerning enemies and backgrounds easy, though the screen can get a little cluttered at times. Enemy designs are varied both visually and mechanically, and whole presentation is just oozing style. Sound design is kept in similar simplicity, though I personally find the music a little bit too monotonous after a while. One thing that perplexes me is that the game has trouble maintaining 60 fps even on a relatively strong PC \u2013 it must be an issue with underlying game engine, as there is really nothing here that should stress any modern system whatsoever. The controls stay responsive and precise at all times, so it\u2019s not that much of a big deal.\n\t\nIn the end, \u201cDownwell\u201d is a minimalistic, tough platformer where only rewards are really in your head. If it\u2019s for you or not \u2013 that\u2019s a personal thing. I was very pleasantly surprised and I\u2019m constantly finding myself running the game for a quick run now and then. Plus, it\u2019s very reasonably priced, so if you\u2019re not absolutely fed up with retro-themed games and you like a challenge, I\u2019d say it\u2019s worth a try.\n", "timestamp_created": 1459020019, "timestamp_updated": 1459020019, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22067172": {"recommendationid": "22067172", "author": {"steamid": "76561198291992613", "num_games_owned": 65, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 546, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1460758621}, "language": "english", "review": "You go down in a well.\n\n11/10 Lives up to it's name.", "timestamp_created": 1459010962, "timestamp_updated": 1459010962, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22060108": {"recommendationid": "22060108", "author": {"steamid": "76561198206051044", "num_games_owned": 750, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 108, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498995595}, "language": "english", "review": "It's really fun to play and with this price tag, you should absolutely get this game.

It is, in every inch of its design philosophy, a game made at the beginning of video game hardware--Atari, NES (let's not talk about Pong etc.)--it takes one concept and enlarges it to be the focus of the entire experience. In Downwell, your only goal is to fall down the well--until, presumably, you reach the bottom. The game acknowledges this singular intent, and as such does its best to make everything about the experience interesting or enjoyable. It gives you combos for bouncing on the heads of enemies. There are perks. A shop system. And a risk/reward that becomes accounting at some point as you reach for the highest scores or fastest time.\n\nAs is perhaps a persistent thot, a local co-op for this style of game would have elevated it to legend status--imagine crowding around the CRT screen with your ten-year-old friend to bounce down to hell together--and in a less punishing vehicle than Battletoads, too.\n\nDownwell is a wonderful game, a perfect mix of roguelike, platformer, and good old hi-score chasing addiction.

There is an assortment of enemies that you need to deal with in different ways. This isn't so bad when you figure each individual enemy out. The bigger challenge comes when you are falling down the well and everything is coming at you in a blur. You need to be able to react in split seconds in order to stay alive. You also have to be able to catch yourself in order to make use of the powerups and shops that appear at the side of the well.  I tell you, that is very challenging and will result in many deaths and many disappointments. No worries, though. Each playthrough gives you experience points that unlock new pallettes and, more importantly, new playstyles, which affect small aspects of each playthrough. \nThis is a game that I won't spend too much time on but can see myself coming back to time and again. One negative for the game is that it could easily get repetative for some, especially if you don't want to put in the effort to hone your reaction times. This is necessary to advance further into the well. Small variations and upgrades give the game enough diversity to make me want to keep coming back to do this. Highly recommended!

For most enemies you can just step on 'em.\n\nControls for both keyboard & a controller work well. Can't rebind 'em but they're simple enough where it's doubtful one would even need to.\n\nYou can only shoot downwards and while in midair. There's also an ammo count that, unless you get a certain upgrade, only recharges/reloads from stepping on something you can bounce off of platformer style or landing on a platform. The game goes by pretty fast if you keep up the momentum of falling down which can get a bit exhilarating.\nYou can rack up combos by killing via stepping or shooty shoot without landing on a regular platform. Passing certain combo counts give small rewards but after hitting 25 you're not rewarded with anymore than what a 25 count would normally give.\n\nIt's incredibly lightweight in the \"rogue-lite\" section; if you go through the same numbered level again (1-1, 1-2, etc.) there won't be much noticeable and/or notable differences in the terrain and enemy placements. Much harder to notice since your primary focus is going down and staying alive.\nAfter you beat a level you get a small selection of upgrades to choose from. Throughout the game though the total upgrades that actually exist here are incredibly small in number, meaning that throughout multiple playthroughs you'll eventually be getting the option to choose the same upgrade(s) you had in the previous run you did.\nThere are occassional shops that pop up as you play however their selection only comes down to a +1 or +2 increase in your max ammo count, +1 or +2 to health gain, and the highly uncommon +1 increase in max health.\nYou'll also occassionally find different weapons you can pick up but you can't know what they do until you actually pick them up or recognize what they'll give you by the letter shown on the item. These don't come in high number as well but once you get to know them you can sort of strategize a bit on whether or not the weapon would be useful for the current situation.\n\nAfter you beat the game for the first time you're rewarded with the option to go through Hard Mode which dramatically increases the enemy count per level, change the levels themselves slightly, increase the cost of items in shops, and add a few new enemies to go up against.\n\nIt's a small game in size and content if you can manage all 12 of its levels but it's great fun for its full $2.99 price.", "timestamp_created": 1457319289, "timestamp_updated": 1457319760, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21675570": {"recommendationid": "21675570", "author": {"steamid": "76561198158553363", "num_games_owned": 58, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3312, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509210158}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Juego tremendamente adictivo que bebe de lo clasico del medio para ofrecer un juego m\u00e1s que digno, ni se excede en contenido ni le sobra nada, roza la perfeccion y por eso le doy un 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1457304030, "timestamp_updated": 1457304030, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21675225": {"recommendationid": "21675225", "author": {"steamid": "76561198171303165", "num_games_owned": 151, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1273, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483329852}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is too addictive and is ruining my life. 9/10 recommended.", "timestamp_created": 1457302606, "timestamp_updated": 1457302606, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21675057": {"recommendationid": "21675057", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996573783", "num_games_owned": 184, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 703, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512432404}, "language": "english", "review": "it's 2.99$ for a fun, addicting game with great design and replay value, why not buy it?", "timestamp_created": 1457301921, "timestamp_updated": 1457301921, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21671447": {"recommendationid": "21671447", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018766364", "num_games_owned": 111, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 586, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1457361916}, "language": "english", "review": "Quite challenging but definitely worth it.

Downwell is a game about bouncing on top of your enemies and racking up combos. The more combos you get the better rewards you receive (up to 25 combos). Bouncing from enemy to enemy is [b]extremely [/b] satisfying to do. You also can shoot bullets and some enemies must be shot. Downwell is a very short game and it can be beaten in less than 30 minutes. The game has an old 2D pixel look to it and has music that sounds right out of a Gameboy Color game. Some people may not like this but I love it.\n\n[h1]The Good[/h1]\n[list]\n[*] The game has lots of replayability.\n[*] Hard mode is so good you want to [strike]break your controller[/strike] play over and over!\n[*] Quick fun game that can be beaten in short sessions\n[/list]\n\n[h1]The Bad[/h1]\n[list]\n[*] If you do not have nostalgia for retro graphics and music you might not like them in this game.\n[*] I wish there was a daily challenge mode and leaderboard.\n [/list]\n\n[h1]Final Thoughts[/h1]\nIf you are OK with the simple graphics and retro music Downwell is a game that can be enjoyed!

Average run for me was about 10 minutes, and I enjoyed each one.\n\nFour areas with three levels each, spiking in difficulty with the second- the third and fourth areas aren't as difficult to traverse as the second, probably owing to the several upgrades you will have acquired by the time you reach them.\nIn particular I found the fourth area (with exception to the last stage) to be even easier than the first, though this may have been purposeful, to allow you access to the difficult end boss.\n\nIt didn't take me too long to beat the game, but defeating the last boss unlocks hard mode. Downwell is already a fairly difficult game, so hard mode doesn't pull any punches. It definitely poses a fun challenge, though, especially if you've become very competent playing on normal mode.\n\nExtremely energetic and quick-paced, and very very fun.

You pick up currency you can spend on consumable items and power ups at shops.  When you finish a level you gain a power up, similar to what happens when you finish a level in nuclear throne.  All the levels are procedurally generated and each world has its own enemies and nuances.  Games start fast, go fast, and end fast with a few unlocks as part of a overarching reward scheme.  So, it's kind of like a rogue-like where you fall down and see how far down you can go.\n\nFinding bad things to say about the game is hard, the controls are as tight as a NES era console game, there's a jump button, a shoot button, and you can go left or right as you fall.  I'd recommend a controller to play.  Your gun boots reload as you hit some floor or solid object.  The power ups are meaningful and change the way you approach encounters as you fall down the well.  The graphical design is old, Atari old, the color consists of a black-color grayscale palate where you can change the \"color\" as an option.

Pagato due euro tondi tondi, questo platform arcade \u00e8 quanto di pi\u00f9 semplice si possa trovare sullo store di Steam. La premessa \u00e8 semplicissima: il nostro alter-ego digitale dovr\u00e0 scendere sempre pi\u00f9 in basso, livello dopo livello, disintegrando a suon di stomp e di proiettili qualunque nemico si pari davanti alla nostra inesorabile caduta libera. Lo stile 8-bit ricorda grandi classici quali Arkanoid, Castelvania e numerosi titoli del passato, seppur l'atmosfera e il dinamismo sono quanto di pi\u00f9 moderno si possa testare su joypad (decisamente meglio che con la tastiera). Nel corso dei livelli e della nostra discesa, distruggendo determinati blocchi e nemici, entrando in aree protette o distruggendo qualche elemento dello scenario, saremo in grado di raccogliere gemme, la valuta del gioco che ci permetter\u00e0 di comprare upgrade, salute e ricariche per i nostri stivali o semplicemente per ricaricare la vita. Oltretutto se riusciremo a rimanere in volo, colpendo i nemici saltandogli sopra oppure sparandogli in volo, potremo creare combo che ci permetteranno di ottenere gemme aggiuntive. In pi\u00f9, alla fine di ogni livello ci verr\u00e0 data la possiblit\u00e0 di prendere degli upgrade per il nostro personaggio (un po' come avviene in The Binding Of Isaac, per capirci), che si riveleranno utilissimi specialmente per i livelli avanzati. A fine livello (o non appena periremo durante la discesa) accumuleremo le gemme totali che abbiamo raccolto in precedenza per poter sbloccare nuovi stili di gioco e nuove palette di colori, che andranno a modificare l'estetica con combinazioni tematiche molto particolari. \n\nQuesto \u00e8 Downwell. Io posso soltanto consigliare l'acquisto a chiunque voglia sano divertimento senza voler spendere uno occhio della testa.

You have to manage your money, and make sure that, when you get out a loan from the bank, you have enough money to pay it back, or are at least making enough daily profit to pay it back.\n\nYou also manage a business. You can hire drivers to work for you, and they will complete jobs for you, but you have to pay them a wage, plus some for every journey they complete. You level up they skills, that make them be better at certian things, like you can make them earn more money for going over a set distance, or you can make them carry high value or fragile cargo. They can also carry ADR materials, so things that could be dangourous. But you get paid more for that.\n\nYou can always do 'Quick Jobs', and these are when the employer provides the truck, and you just go where they tell you. This is fun, but it starts to get boring, only doing short deliverys, so you can buy a truck, so that you can go further distances, and get more money.\n\nTo conclude, I feel that anybody who likes games like Farm Simulator, or any simulator game should give this game a try, because it is a great way to unwind after a long day, and I have found it to be so much fun and very calming.

M\u00e1s le vale haber llevado las botangas tira-lazers, si no se podr\u00eda lastimar.\n\nDownwell es un juego independiente de la mano de tres desarrolladores japoneses, el principal, Ojiro Fumoto, y distribuido por Devolver Digital. Un juego en dos dimensiones roguelike, con pixel art que utiliza tres colores al mismo tiempo en todo el juego, no es algo que sonar\u00eda con optimismos; Ya esta inundado el mercado de juegos de este tipo, con un giro que, en gran parte de los casos, resume muchos efectos a la generaci\u00f3n aleatoria y no tanto al control del jugador.\n\nDownwell tiene la suerte de ser un plataformas con elementos menores de Roguelike, y no al reves. El juego generara la estructura de los niveles de manera aleatoria, pero siempre va introduciendo al jugador a sus conceptos de buena manera y sin hacer que parezca mucho. Los enemigos van a ir variando al pasar de zona en zona, pero los enemigos de una zona no van a aparecer en otra (al menos que varien mecanicas y esten justificados). Las armas que se pueden conseguir pueden ir variando, pero son hasta menos de ocho. Las tiendas pueden generarse en cualquier sitio y pueden tener distintos items, pero los vamos a ir viendo repetidos. \n\nY eso es lo que lo hace tan buen juego. Al decidir ser un juego simple, cuyas mecanicas se establecen desde el principio, y los items que existen en el juego no son demasiados, lleva al jugador a depender menos de un RNG, y hace que este vaya adquiriendo capacidad y competencia en el juego. Y los items que se van a conseguir, o son un lujo, o son en situaciones extremas. Basicamente, en este juego va a ser Git Gud or Git Rekt.\n\n\u00bfY que carajos se hace en Downwell? Bueno, basicamente controlas a un monigote que tiene que bajar lo m\u00e1s profundo posible de un pozo. Puedes moverte, saltar, y al estar en el aire puedes disparar con tus botas, tanto como para matar enemigos, como para controlar la caida y acabar con ellos desde arriba a lo Mayro Bros. Hay enemigos que puedes pisar, hay unos que no. Hay tiendas que te puedes cruzar y comprar items de ellas, y hay cuevas en las que puedes encontrar dinero u otro tipo de disparo/arma. Te tocan 4/6 veces, mueres, y empiezas de nuevo. \n\nLo que hace que Downwell sea un juego que recomiende recae en los solidos y muy bien estructurados controles. El personaje responde muy bien a como queremos que este se mueva, y al haber una velocidad relativamente rapida en dicho personaje, varias de las acciones que vamos hacer van a tomar fracciones de fracciones de segundos. \n\nOtro factor que hace que Downwell sea Downwell, es su paleta de colores minimalista. En todo el juego se utilizan solo tres (?) colores (los cuales pueden variar desbloqueando distintas paletas): Rojo, que es lo que puede interactuar con el jugador de mala/buena manera; Blanco, que es aquello que no causa da\u00f1o al jugador; Y negro, que es basicamente el vacio, no es nada, no existe. Son faciles de reconocer, son faciles de entender, y van variando a lo largo del juego, a\u00f1adiendo profundidad a lo largo que pasa el tiempoblahblablablablablablablhablablabhlabhlbhalahb.\n\n\nOK. Me dejo de charlataner\u00eda. En resumen, vete a jugar esto, son tres dolares, y valen mucho la pena.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvalen mucho la pena? esa mierda de frase a caso existe??? bah.\n", "timestamp_created": 1453762286, "timestamp_updated": 1453762286, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20753555": {"recommendationid": "20753555", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020636903", "num_games_owned": 234, "num_reviews": 64, "playtime_forever": 427, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480248235}, "language": "spanish", "review": "8/10 si lo juegas en m\u00f3vil\n6/10 si lo juegas en PC, eso s\u00ed, puedes ver v\u00eddeos mientras juegas.", "timestamp_created": 1453752720, "timestamp_updated": 1453752720, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490604", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20752932": {"recommendationid": "20752932", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013755931", "num_games_owned": 454, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 547, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1453662560}, "language": "english", "review": "First 2 worlds, great!

I don't even usually like roguelites, but Downwell surprised me with its addictive, twitchy gameplay.  The combo system is an interesting mechanic because it encourages you to stay in the air for as long as possible.  This forces you to choose between bouncing off of enemies, shooting them, or shooting simply to take advantage of your weapon's recoil.\n\nDownwell does contain randomness, but it almost never seems unfair or out of your hands--complaints I've had with many other roguelikes.  Its difficulty is therefore perfectly acceptable.\n\nI can think of two complaints, the first being that it can sometimes be difficult to tell whether your character will land on an enemy and kill them, or hit them from the side and take damage.  I'm sure I'll be crucified by roguelike purists for saying this, but I would have preferred a slightly more generous collision detection system.  My second criticism is that combo bonuses do not increase past 25 enemies killed, so you are encouraged to land and break your combo every so often, rather than seeing how high you can go.\n\nIf you enjoy tight, streamlined gameplay and are interested in objectively improving at something the more time you spend with it, I wholeheartedly recommend Downwell.", "timestamp_created": 1453173957, "timestamp_updated": 1453174059, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20616938": {"recommendationid": "20616938", "author": {"steamid": "76561198096194572", "num_games_owned": 661, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 446, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510974996}, "language": "english", "review": "The title says it all its about going down and killing everything that moves with your gun boots that you just happen to have with you. its one of those games where one run might take less than 5 mins, so when you die you dont get as frustrated.

For the aesthetics, it is a retro 8-bit style game to fit the aging genre. For the gameplay aspect, your player character is equipped with a pair of gunboots that would help not only fight monsters that inhabit Downwell but can be used as a means of controlling yourself as gravity is pulling you downwards. There are also many altercations you can find to change your gunboots like a triple shot or a laser beam. But every time you die, you lose these upgrades you acquire, ala permadeath. \nThe thing that may turn off some people from the game is the difficulty since it is part of the trend of old school hard games.

If you like quick and casual action games, I can't reccomend this game enough.\n\n[h1]Mechanics/Controls[/h1]\nThe gameplay is simple, you have to travel downwards without getting hit to many times, you shoot downwards, and can damage certian enemies by jumping on them. after each level you choose a random ability or upgrade. The controls are  very easy to handle, even on a mobile device; they are tight allowing precision even in the game's fast pacing. This is one of the few randomly generating type games I like.\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\nDownwell has a minimalistic retro pixel-art style with fluid animation. This is one of my favorites games, in terms of graphics. The game only has 3 different colors in it's pallette: background and 2 forground colors, 1 is safe and other hurts you. This gives enemies pixel based hit areas instead of boxes and instantly communicates the way objects and enemies can hurt you.\n\n[h1]Audio[/h1]\nWhen playing on mobile I often mute the game, as I often play this on the bus/train... but I swear I play better when the audio is on. The Audio is top notch, but don't take my word for it, the gameplay footages above pretty much includes the entire soundtrack; Go ahead give it a listen!\n\nAt $2.99 this will give you hours if not days of fun.

Make your way from the start of the level at the top, to the end at the bottom. Down the well, as the title implies.\n\nTo flesh out this idea, each of the 12 levels are procedurally generated to some degree in the placement of platforms, powerups, and obstacles - which take the form of archetypal platformer baddies like bats, ghosts, frogs... and spikes. Lots and lots of spikes. You can easily deal with most of your foes by stomping on them, though some will require you to blast them with one of the several downward-shooting weapons you can find along the way. The weapon recoil is also useful for slowing your fall. Completing each level will allow you to choose from a small selection of buffs, such as a drone that follows you for additional damage, or the ability to eat the corpses of your foes to regain health. Lovely. There are also randomly appearing shops to spend your gems, which is the currency of the game, where you can buy more health or energy upgrades for your weapon.\n\nDownwell is blessed by some very precise and responsive controls, whether which using a keyboard or controller. This both allows for some really satisfying moments where you can pull off massive combos after several successive enemy stomps, and it also means that deaths don't feel frustratingly unfair, unlike some other procedurally generated games.\nThe levels are split into four distinct themes: the first being like a cave where you can get to grips with the controls, the second introducing platforms with spikes that appear if you stand on them for too long, as well as new ghostly enemies. Next is everyone's favourite water level where your oxygen supply is limited. You can replenish your supply by breaking bottles and clam shells. In the last part of the game, the difficulty ramps up further with levels that have no platforms to land on at all (every wall and platform is covered in spikes!), meaning you have to rely on your shooting and stomping skills to properly control your fall. Completing this relatively short game will also unlock a harder mode.\n\nThe visual style is authentically retro-looking, and coupled with the 8bit music and sound effects, it could genuinely pass for a game from the 1980's. A cool feature that some people will appreciate is that you can change the colour palette of the game from the options menu. You can also unlock different palettes as you keep playing the game, and collect more and more gems which get added to a counter, unlocking new palettes each time it fills. The music does the job of adding thematic ambience to each of the level styles, but none of the tunes are particularly catchy or memorable.\n\nAs you'd imagine from a simplistic-looking game, it runs very well on pretty much any spec PC. The framerate is locked to 60 which is just fine. I haven't encountered any glitches or crashes and my Xbox One controller worked from the start. As previously mentioned, using the keyboard works just fine too.\n\nSo this all sounds great, right? Then why does this game, even at full price, only cost $3? Well, aside from the game being short, it also lacks in content and depth (irony?). What few weapon varieties there are, all pretty much function the same, and don't change the playstyle much. The same issue extends to the powerups. There are far fewer than you'd find on similar sorts of games like Risk of Rain or Binding of Isaac, and they also don't really have enough of an impact to make each playthrough unique.\n\nStill, if you set your expectations on the price, then this game is an absolute steal. Those who love platform games will especially enjoy it thanks to its challenging gameplay and tight controls. Plus it's an ideal game if you just need something to occupy 20 minutes of your time.\n\nDownwell is an enjoyable and highly polished challenge and an absolute bargain, but the lack of content makes it feel more like the foundation of a game, and a disappointing waste of potential for such a great idea.", "timestamp_created": 1452541376, "timestamp_updated": 1452541376, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525970", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20473470": {"recommendationid": "20473470", "author": {"steamid": "76561198102024039", "num_games_owned": 84, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 185, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494703368}, "language": "english", "review": "I suck at this game.

It's kind of like Vertical Drop Heroes in that the majority of your movement is vertically downward, with only your boot \"bullets\" and stomping on items/enemies to slow you down. You have a limited charge of gunboot bullets before you run out (and then enter free fall) but this can be replenished by landing or bouncing on an object or enemy. Additionally, killing enough enemies before you \"land\" on a flat surface will run up a combo counter that pays out generously if you can make it to 25 (extra heart, charge, and 100 gems). The game gives you a choice of one of 3 upgrades per level and there are shops to boost the amount of HP and charge you have.\n\nI found the controls to be pretty good, especially in the floaty style which is really forgiving for players new to the game and the game itself really is easy to learn. However, the randomized levels and red enemies, which cannot be stomped, really ramp up the difficulty a lot for players looking to try and get 25 hit combos for that extra HP. To make things even more difficult, each of the zones adds additional stage hazards, making your journey to the bottom even more perilous. You are going to die a lot over and over again before you can even get \u201cokay\u201d at this game. I found myself really wishing there had been some sort of easier mode or maybe even save points.\n\nDespite how fun the game is in all of its difficulty, I decided to finally throw in the towel after around 12 hours and making it to the final boss for the 4th time only to get quickly destroyed yet again.

On the first night I played the game, I spent two straight hours playing through it, a testament of how fun and addicting it is. It's a retro style platformer, but instead of side scrolling, you constantly go down. The point of the game is to try and advance through the different levels all while avoiding damage and taking out enemies. You get various upgrades and abilities that makes the experience a little bit easier as you go on. What's interesting about this game is that the levels are never the same. They're randomly generated so it's never the same level. One cool thing about this game is being able to change the color of the screen. So far, I've noticed that there are 9 different colors and it changes quite a lot. Overall, I recommend this game and I give it a 4/5.\n\n2/10/16 6:30am: I've just finished beating this game and though it was a hard and infuriating journey, it was worth it.", "timestamp_created": 1451991049, "timestamp_updated": 1455103852, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500872", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20315089": {"recommendationid": "20315089", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046193538", "num_games_owned": 234, "num_reviews": 158, "playtime_forever": 733, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472695250}, "language": "english", "review": "As of writing this review, I've put in a measly 37 minutes of gameplay. Yet I'm already hooked at this game's fast-paced action with simple controls; the game is played with 3 buttons. The retro music fits in perfectly with the pixel graphics as well, and you can unlock things (such as different colors and gameplay modes) simply by collecting gems (which are dropped by pretty much everything you hit). Because of this, even if you get a game over, the gems you collected still count towards unlocking things.\n\nThe gameplay is very simple, but that doesn't mean it's easy. The startup screen shows otherwise, but the game can be played either with a controller or with the spacebar and the left and right arrow keys. You play as a character equipped with what are called Gunboots; as the name implies, they're shoes with guns that shoot downwards. You can only shoot them while you're in the air; the boots will shoot downwards, consuming charges (gunboots ammo, so to speak) as well as allowing you to briefly hover in place, cancelling your downward momentum. The instant you land on a platform or enemy, the boots will instantly reload. You can land on enemies rather than shoot them in order to kill them, but some enemies hurt you if you land on them while other enemies must be jumped on to kill them. When you defeat an enemy, they'll drop gems; collecting these gems allows you to spend them at shops located periodically throughout the levels. These shops allow you to restore some health or increase your max charges.\n\nOne of the reasons I personally think this game is so great is because it turns the concept of platformers upside down. Literally. Rather than going up, the objective is to go down. This in itself makes this platformer feel very different than the other games, as the objective isn't to go forward, upwards or a combination thereof. However, falling down too fast makes it difficult to survive as you'll get hit by enemies that are approaching too fast for you to react due to your fall speed; as such, the game makes you take a fine balance between using your gunboots to hover in place briefly (while shooting enemies) and falling. Another thing I personally enjoy is, as I mentioned earlier, how a game doesn't feel like a wasted effort if you get a game over. There are some games that are simply brutal; run out of health and it's back to the start and you get nothing. In a game with a difficulty like this, it feels like a marathon to see how far down in the well you can get, rewarding you after reach run with the gems you yourself collected in that run. When you ultimately do beat the game, you'll unlock Hard Mode, which is aptly named; there are far more enemies on each level, and the stage hazards are tweaked a bit as well to make gameplay more difficult (such as your oxygen level depleting faster on the water stages).\n\nIf you're unsure if you'll like this game, simply look at some gameplay footage; the game plays exactly how it appears.\n\nAnd I think it's awesome.", "timestamp_created": 1451974178, "timestamp_updated": 1454271422, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495295", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20312554": {"recommendationid": "20312554", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000811052", "num_games_owned": 145, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 261, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494685211}, "language": "english", "review": "Maddening fast-paced Metroid-like with gun-boots and constant descent.

I can guarentee that you won't regret it (unless you don't like this kind of game.)", "timestamp_created": 1451436765, "timestamp_updated": 1451436765, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20094874": {"recommendationid": "20094874", "author": {"steamid": "76561198137885732", "num_games_owned": 126, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 616, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482584460}, "language": "english", "review": "A game about wearing the proper footwear.", "timestamp_created": 1451429312, "timestamp_updated": 1451429312, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20093952": {"recommendationid": "20093952", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024911395", "num_games_owned": 202, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 493, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486793855}, "language": "english", "review": "help im stuck in this well", "timestamp_created": 1451427352, "timestamp_updated": 1451427352, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498992", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20079661": {"recommendationid": "20079661", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013295577", "num_games_owned": 400, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 88, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1454264124}, "language": "english", "review": "NAIS GAME BOIS", "timestamp_created": 1451418796, "timestamp_updated": 1451418796, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20076218": {"recommendationid": "20076218", "author": {"steamid": "76561198145834338", "num_games_owned": 86, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 230, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499043988}, "language": "english", "review": "It absorbs you. \n\nYou waste your time in it.\n\nYour money.\n\nYour life.\n\nThe hole where you fall in the game is an representation of how your adiction to this game is bringing you to the purest hell.\n\nConsciously.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPretty good game, if you ask me ;)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1451412250, "timestamp_updated": 1451412250, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20076024": {"recommendationid": "20076024", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998324410", "num_games_owned": 698, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 341, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451453695}, "language": "english", "review": "Super easy to pick up and a lot harder to master.

Sometimes you can earn bonuses or use them as stepping stones to reach new places. [i]Downwell[/i] is an entire game about this. \n\nThis is a very well-polished, well-balanced action game with a neat visual style consisting of about only four colors.\n\nThe object of the game is to jump down the well, fall through twelve stages, and fight a boss. Each run is different, as the levels have randomly generated terrain, and there are also a few simple perks, stats, weapons, and upgrades to earn in a different order each game. Every three stages, the environment changes into something surprisingly different which will probably kill you the first time you make it that far, but a pleasantly stable skill curve will reward your persistence. Through dying many times you can also unlock different characters and palette swaps for the entire game, some of which will make your eyes bleed, others which are awesome enough that they might actually improve your skill level.\n\nDon\u2019t be fooled: this is no metroidvania or roguelike. It\u2019s not a game about exploring the scenery, hunting treasure, and slowly proceeding forward. It\u2019s more like a vertically-scrolling [i]Canabalt[/i] where you only have a few moments to react to whatever the game throws at you. It also has the same addictive \u201cjust one more try!\u201d quality that runner games have.\n\nAlso, don\u2019t make the newbie mistake of thinking that the gunboots are your main weapon. Your main weapon is your ability to stomp on enemies, and the gunboots are mostly just there to help you stabilize and aim your jump. [i]Downwell[/i] is all about the combos. The game rewards you with money and stat boosts for killing many enemies without touching the ground, things which can add up and make all the difference by the end of the game.\n\nI had a blast with this game! It\u2019s got a refreshingly new type of gameplay for a platformer, and the shadowy, creepy pixel graphics were stylish and fun to watch. The last achievement is quite tough, and achievement hunters can expect anywhere from 10 to 40 hours of gameplay depending on how they handle the daunting final challenge the game has in store.\n", "timestamp_created": 1451407545, "timestamp_updated": 1451407545, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 31, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.557261", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20072641": {"recommendationid": "20072641", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086813717", "num_games_owned": 67, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 300, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498404913}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun game to play on your lunch break.", "timestamp_created": 1451405354, "timestamp_updated": 1451405354, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20070561": {"recommendationid": "20070561", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024783362", "num_games_owned": 115, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 346, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1466910760}, "language": "english", "review": "If you like games that are distilled and refined to solid game play mechanics and feel then do not pass this game up, it's an amazing game at a steal of a price.", "timestamp_created": 1451401351, "timestamp_updated": 1451401351, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499166", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20066687": {"recommendationid": "20066687", "author": {"steamid": "76561198232074032", "num_games_owned": 30, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 375, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482326191}, "language": "english", "review": "Buy this game!

What matters when doing a retro style game is aesthetic, and this gots the nail on the head.

In a similar vain to Super House of Dead Ninjas, you run into a hostile environment where everything wants to kill you, with one weapon, and see how long you last.\n\nIn Downwell, your weapon is the titular gunboots. A suspiciously situational weapon that just so happens to function perfectly for this area. What untold treasure you're looking for, I have no clue. But I'm guessing it's a weapon that can function beyond a purely vertical environment. Along the way, you discover gems. Which are both a form of currency and an illegal narcotic, as collecting enough gives you a gem high. I have no idea what the gem high does, but like all crippling addictions it can only be sated through unsavory acts like murder (killing enemies) and vandalism (breaking certain blocks and background objects).\n\nIf you're willing to part with your gem-shaped narcotics, however, you may find a shop within the caves. Run by a man I like to call \"Master Onion\". Master Onion isn't too smart, but he's more than happy to help by supplying you with health and ammo for your continued survival. Just don't go behind the counter, or he'll make a grumpy face.\n\nIf luck favors you, you'll stumble upon small caves containing gems and gun mods. These caves are protected by Time Voids, which stop all time outside when you enter them. Allowing you to take your sweet-ass time collecting what's inside. Gun mods change the way your gun fires, and it's in your best interest to pick them up, as they provide additional health and ammo. Making it through the various sections of the map allow you to pick upgrades, which are passive bonuses to further assist your survival.\n\nWhen you are inevitably murdered by whatever critters lurk inside the well, you earn XP, filling up the bar unlocks Palettes (which change the color scheme of the game in various eye-straining ways) and Styles. Styles have the minor affect of changing some of your sprite animations, but the major effect of changing certain game mechanics. Such as your health, the frequency of visits from Master Onion, etc. Picking the style that suits you most, along with some practice, is how I imagine you'd make your way through this gauntlet. I've not seen past the beginning of the second area, and as far as I know there are no checkpoints.\n\nDownwell is one of those games that I imagine I'll never be able to beat, but I still enjoy playing the hell out of it.

A good hour solid. And I can say that Downwell is the best Indie game I have PERSONALLY played in a while. And with good reason. This game is simple. Amazingly simple. And that is brilliant.\n\nLet me firstly talk about the controls. When I say simple, I am mostly talking about the controls. You need to use a whopping, THREE keys to play this game. That's right, only three keys. A, D and Right Shift. Personally, I thought this game was going to be one of those games that would be a pain in the butt to get used to with controls, but within my first run of playing the game I have the controls figured out. That is one of the biggest signs of a good game; easy controls which don't take long for you to understand and figure out.\n\nArt style in this game may look amazingly basic... And, well, it is. Once again, that is perfectly fine! You realise that the art doesn't take away from the basic gameplay of the game, and you soon realise that the art doesn't affect this game or the way you play it. That can be said for tonnes of other games, but it's not for this review. The art, whilst being basic, is lovely looking. It's not a strain to the eyes, it doesn't make me want to stop playing it after a good 10 minutes and it's really visually pleasing.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, this game has a very simple style of how you play it. You fall, whilst stomping on enemies or shooting them with your Gunboats. That's it, attack enemies. Sounds simple, right? It's not. It's really not. Your inevitable thoughts of being good at the game will soon be counteracted with how amazingly hard it actually is. Now, I mean hard as in \"You-get-better-as-the-game-progresses\" type hard, and not a \"This-game-is-so-unfair-and-not-fun\" type hard.\n\nIn terms of upgrades and such, when you complete the current floor you're on, you get a few upgrades to choose from. So far, each of the upgrades I've seen actually help you and none are a direct downgrade. There are small little enclaves which contain things to help you. You can either get weapons, health, a combination of both or even a shop. Gems are used when you die. They unlock skins for how the game looks. No, it doesn't change the art style (not that I know of, still very early in!), it changes the colour and theme of the game. I've currently unlocked a few skins, and I must say they're rather pleasing to have.\n\nAll in all, this game is great. I currently have no flaws with it. Except for the bats, man screw those little things. It's not a flaw, merely just a thing I'm going to have to get better at dealing with. And that's about it for this game, for such a cheap price you cannot go wrong with this game. And currently there is nothing wrong with this game that I can find!

The rules are pretty simple: you are failing down a well, you've got a gunboots that serve as weapons for the enemies beneath and slowdown your descent with limited ammo which can be refilled when you land on the ground or jump on an enemies head. Certain enemies (the ones that are completely red if you haven't changed the colours) can only die to bullets and others (shelled enemies) only to being stomped on. If you kill five enemies in a row without landing you start a combo which can give you gems (the games currency), more bullets per magasines and health if you make it long enough. The only real issues I have with the game play is that there seems to be a wall jump that is inconsistent and that more often than not makes me jump into an enemy\n\nLevel description\n\nDuring your descent, to assist you, you will find side rooms sorrounded with a small bubble that stop times which either contains a giant gem which you can shoot to get (surprise!) gems, gun mods which changed your gun and gives you either health or more bullets per clip or shops were you can spend gems. When you collect enough gems you enter a gem high which allows your bullets to do more damages. As you get further in the well you will enter different areas which each have their own unique challanges to deal with (not spoiling any of its fun), with the last one which test all the skills you've accrued to that point. Each of these areas are split into 3 parts and you'll get to choose between three upgrades in between each of the parts to help you during the game.\n\nReplayability\n\nAfter each run you will do in the game you will gain EXP which allow you to unlock new styles which changes a bit how the game works (starting with more health but less upgrade choice, get more gun mod rooms but no gem room and less stores, etc.) and to unlock new colour palettes, some of which are awesome and others hurt your eyes. When you finish the game and discover what is at the bottom of the well you unlock a hard mode which adds more enemies and change slightly (or greatly) how an area work.

You only have two controls:  jump and shoot, all controlled with the same button, so you'll either be using the directional pad of your controller, jumping, or shooting.  When you shoot, your fall is slowed down until you run out of ammo, but your dude will reload after you either land on a rock or platform or stomp an enemy.  You'll also collect gems as you destroy rocks and kill enemies, and you can use these gems in shops on the way down to get better gun upgrades or refill your HP.  Each level concludes with you reaching the water at the bottom of the well.  The wells get deeper and take longer to complete the higher levels you reach.\n\nIt's a rogue-like, so you'll keep playing and progressing until you die, then it's back to level 1.  It will take your gems and give you a progress bar. Once it's filled, you'll unlock different colors for your screen as well as styles of play. \n\nYou'll die a lot when you first start because you'll think you have the game figured out and you so don't.  You're not just falling and shooting stuff.  There IS strategy involved, it's not just dumb luck.\n\nMy suggestions are these:  TAKE YOUR TIME.  It's not a race to the bottom.  You want to stay alive as much as possible. Also, know your enemies.  Some of them you HAVE to shoot in order to kill and others can be stomped on the head.  Those little dudes scaling the sides of the walls with the spikey backs..SHOOT THEM.  Those birds can be a nuisance too, so blow them away when you get the chance and don't linger because they will chase you and take a nice bite out of your HP.\n\nKnow your guns.  Not every gun is as effective.  While some are really powerful, they have a very short \"magazine\", so if you're spamming it all the way down, you'll be empty more times than not.  My personal favorites so far are Burst (B), Shotgun (S), Fist (F), and Machine Gun (M).  Laser (L) is my least favorite.\n\nPick your post-level upgrades wisely.  You can drastically change your survivability by choosing the right one.  Giving yourself extra HP is fine, but not if you're not doing as much damage as you could.  You'll just take slightly longer to die.  The Droid is a great upgrade for clearing rocks and enemies as you fall.  I usually grab that and couple it with Triple (T).   I also like the upgrade that reloads your gun as you collect gems.  The less I have to think about reloading the better.  I'm trying to get to the bottom of the well with as much HP left as possible.  The right combo of gun and upgrade can make all the difference. \n\nDon't try to kill every enemy.  Remember, your goal is to stay alive, collect gems, and reach the end of the level, not clear the well of all enemies.  Some enemies you will seriously need to ignore and keep moving down.  If they get persistent, THEN dispatch them, but you're gonna gain gems regardless, so don't waste time trying to kill everything, lest you put yourself at risk of dying early.  You can fall faster than they can chase you, so destroy what's in your way and bypass what is not.\n\nHave fun!  This is another great game from Devolver!\n\n9/10\n", "timestamp_created": 1450198661, "timestamp_updated": 1450198661, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502909", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19712014": {"recommendationid": "19712014", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068092414", "num_games_owned": 90, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 519, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490247080}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\ub2e4 \uc88b\uc740\ub370, \uc801 \ub05d\ubd80\ubd84\uc5d0 \ubd80\ub52a\ud600\uc11c \ub370\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ub2e4\ub294\uac70 \ub0a9\ub4dd \uc548\uac00\uace0,\uac8c\uc784\ubca8\ub7f0\uc2a4\uac00 \uc804\uccb4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc880.. \ub108\ubb34 \uc6b4\ube68.", "timestamp_created": 1450189083, "timestamp_updated": 1450189083, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19709468": {"recommendationid": "19709468", "author": {"steamid": "76561198143339904", "num_games_owned": 51, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3985, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 58, "last_played": 1514072235}, "language": "english", "review": "Really fun game.

Downwell is a game about falling down a well with gunboots strapped to your feet. There are four normal worlds, and a fifth world with a final boss. That might seem like a formula for a short game.\n\nYou are sorely mistaken.\n\nIn Downwell, you will die repeatedly, and you will probably rage quit too. But this game is too satisfying, too addicting, too fun to put down.\n\n This game is a rogue-lite; a roguelike without all of the complexities normally associated with the genre. The levels are randomly generated, making no two playthrough the same.

I was hesitant to buy this game, because most Steam games listed for about $2.99 are not always the greatest of games. I had $3.00 on my account from a recent refund I requested, so I figured I'd spend it.\nThis was the absolute best game I have purchased on Steam so far... I honestly wished I would've never bought Day Z, Rust, Nether, etc... and focused more on the Indie games (being an Indie developer myself). I dont like buying AAA titles, but I need to know what's appealing to audiences. I should not focus on AAA titles but rather on the indie community.\nThis game is amazing. I'm inspired by this game to create, build and concieve projects such as this one. I haven't had a smile on my face when first booting up a game since... ever.\nPros:\n1. Soundtrack\n2.

Very easy to hop in and out of at a whim, as expected of a well-designed mobile port.\n+Rouge-lite elements give a sense of progression both within and out a run, e.g. Upgrades, gem unlocks.\n+A decent sense of balance. No upgrades or weapons feel terribly overpowered from the getgo, unless you go out of your way to find a decent synergy which even then isn't gamebreaking. However...\n-Some styles are clearly better or worse than others, like Levitate Style compared to Normal and Arm Spin to generally everything else. There's not much incentive to take the others beyond self-imposed challenge. Nothing's gamebreaking here, though.\n+Three-tone pallet works well enough, enemies you can and can't stomp are clearly identifiable, leads to color pallets being rewards.\n/Music's okay. I was more impressed with the sound design, though.\n\nTL;DR: This is an honest-to-god game. It's not a terribly large game, but it's designed well, it's presented stylistically, there's never a dull moment, it's cheap, it's addictive, and for what limited content it offers, it is very replayable.

It takes a bit tenacity, and fistful of fast reflexes, some quick enemy identification, and a nice heaping of luck to navigate this vertical scroller. The main challenge of Downwell (and any horizontal scoller section) is reaction to the unknown- as oppose to a typical sidescroller that runs left to right, which gives the player a good deal of insight as what will come next due to the display dimensions of the typical screen. (Most screen and wider than they are tall) This in turn, makes such sections a practice of trial and error, memorizing the map and hazards and react to them before they are displayed on the screen. Downwell shakes this up by having randomized maps and enemy placement, which leans gameplay into the \u201cfalse difficulty\u201d territory. The game is \u201cdifficult\u201d because you don't know what will come up and you have to react to in short order.\n\nCompleting a section rewards the player with a choice of power-up. Many of these are negligible as they add little or no benefit to your survival.(a few tend to hurt your survival) Different weapons are stowed in side areas, which have a greater influence on the gameplay though the \u201chang time\u201d they give a player and damage the deal. Though your default gun works wonders and there is little reason to change it. Oddly, there is poor incentive to shoot enemies with the gun itself, as most can be stomped on, instantly defeated, and have greater rewards. Enemies that can only be defeated with the gun are better off avoided. Indeed, I found ignoring most enemies is the best strategy for survival on the mobile and PC version. The young lad you play is nimble with a small hit box and most enemies are sluggish, making them choice targets to evade rather than engage.\n\nOverall, I find the game better suited to the mobile device than PC, thus my rating- its a cheap, shallow, slightly luck-based game to pick up and play when in transit. In short, it plays like a \u201cfalling\u201d or vertical version of Flappy Birds, and if you like that sort of game, you will enjoy Downwell.

The game is humble, yet so freaking fun, and it deserves to be played, and with that modest price tag it's really easy to start and fall in love with.", "timestamp_created": 1448817571, "timestamp_updated": 1479958574, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495732", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19365735": {"recommendationid": "19365735", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003227119", "num_games_owned": 179, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 1058, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486010363}, "language": "english", "review": "Quite an intense hardcore game,\nJust clear the normal difficulty, now get down to the hard levels.", "timestamp_created": 1448810247, "timestamp_updated": 1448810247, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499955", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19364312": {"recommendationid": "19364312", "author": {"steamid": "76561198121678346", "num_games_owned": 218, "num_reviews": 97, "playtime_forever": 476, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497199911}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Downwell es  definitivamente uno de mis juegos favoritos a partir de ahora, es visualmente muy bonito(aunque est\u00e9 entre dos barras, pero al menos se puede cambiar el fondo) y si no te  gusta el rojo que tiene el juego al principio avanzas un nivel y ya tienes m\u00e1s colores (se cambian en paleta), como las cosas aparecen al azar nunca es igual cada pozo y aunque jugar con teclado es muy frustrante con mando es una gozada, la variedad de armas no es muy grande por lo que he visto y la enorme cantidad de mejoras que puedes elegir en cada nivel me recuerda a Nuclear Throne, perfecto su precio es baj\u00edsimo y me lo paso en grande.", "timestamp_created": 1448806444, "timestamp_updated": 1448806444, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497239", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19363541": {"recommendationid": "19363541", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028049202", "num_games_owned": 325, "num_reviews": 82, "playtime_forever": 558, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492982077}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is amazing if you're into twitchy platformers like Cave Story.\n\nAt first it looks impossibly hard to play, but the controls and mechanics are so intuitive and polished that you actually learn to play it surprisingly fast. For example, it's very clear from the visuals which enemies you can jump on safely, and your character usually ends up making the exact movements you want, even when they're very precise. And the whole game is presented without any tutorial, instead you just learn a bit more of the mechanics and strategies each time you play, and there's a surprising amount of nuance to them. There's choices in how you upgrade your character, how you spend the gems you collect, rewards for completing combos, what types of power ups you go for, etc. and each time you play, you're motivated to try something different, or do better at what you tried last time. The graphics may look primitive, but they're excellent at conveying information. Colors and shapes are used effectively to highlight different types of objects, and even at high speeds, you can see things clearly. The sound effects are also very distinct, and provide helpful feedback.\n\nI'd like to go for all the achievements, but the last 3 might be too hard, we shall see. Maybe I can do it.\n\nOverall Downwell has an amazingly rewarding feeling of improving your skills. At first I looked at the achievements and felt that they would be way too hard, but after a few hours of practice, most of them became easy.\n\nFor people who like this style of skill-based game, I'd say it's perfect.

Here's the review.\n\nSo in downwell the goal is to get to the bottom of this well. And to accomplish this you have to go down the well with bullet firing boots and kill all the monsters within. So that is a pretty simple concept however what makes this game good is the smoothness of the controls. The game plays very smooth like butter! The sound and music is very well done. The graphics are a retro style nostalgia kind of thing. Now as you go down these levels you will run into these little timevoids on the side of the wall. If you enter inside you will find either a shop, upgrades, or gems. Gems are like points that you can pickup from monsters that you kill which can be spent in shops. You can do things like, increase the amount of bullets you have, refill your hp, and even give a health boost. The game also features proccedurely generated levels. So no memorizing levels or anything like that, it's all skill based. It also serves to keep the gameplay from getting stale as well. Now on to the upgrades. In this game the bullets that you fire in the beginning are very simple and don't do much damage. In these timevoid areas you can find upgrades that change what what you shoot out of your boots. For example a shotgun upgrade will let you do a lot of damage up close but not much at a distance, a laser will do a lot of damage but you need to be a good shot to use it effectively. Also all of the upgrades are actually upgrades, they actually help you and are different from each other in certain ways. There is also a very nice variety of monsters.\n\nOverall if you buy this game at full price I think you will easily get your money's worth out of it.\n\n9/10", "timestamp_created": 1448688226, "timestamp_updated": 1448688226, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.999890", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19324815": {"recommendationid": "19324815", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046663378", "num_games_owned": 990, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 63, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1453297181}, "language": "english", "review": "Really addicting roguelike-type game.", "timestamp_created": 1448681651, "timestamp_updated": 1448681651, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499634", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19321348": {"recommendationid": "19321348", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016430725", "num_games_owned": 483, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 112, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491786557}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazingly addictive and simple, the best kind of game.

El punto del juego es atravesar cuatro zonas y derrotar al jefe para terminar el juego, usando nuestras botas (las cuales SOLO DISPARAN HACIA ABAJO) para matar a quien se ponga en nuestro camino o para mantenerse en el aire. Es un peque\u00f1o juego de plataformas, rogue-lite y down-scroller.\nEmpezando, el personaje se mueve muy r\u00e1pido, por lo que en un inicio es una bestia para controlar, pero con un ratillo de juego uno se acostumbra; a pesar de ser muy veloz, la manera de controlar el personaje es muy muy c\u00f3moda, pues se puede mover con mucha seguridad (el personaje no se resbala al aterrizar ni cosas por el estilo). Otra parte interesante del juego es que existe la posibilidad de hacer combos saltando sobre los enemigos sin tocar el suelo, un como de 8+ te da 100 gemas (dichas gemas se usan en las tiendas para comprar distintos productos), uno de 14+ proporciona 100 gemas y una bala m\u00e1s y uno de 24+ da lo anterior y otro punto de salud. Hay una variedad de tipos de disparos que se ajustan mejor a cada jugador: unas que disparan m\u00e1s r\u00e1pido pero hacen menos da\u00f1o y otras que hacen mucho da\u00f1o, pero disparan pocas balas. Al inicio de la partida tenemos la libertad de seleccionar el estilo que qeremos, que modifica la velocidad a la que ca\u00e9mos, la salud con la que iniciamos o la frecuencia con la que aparecer\u00e1n las tiendas. A medida que bajamos nos topamos con una especie de burbujas que detienen el tiempo, dentro de estas puedes cambiar el tipo de bala que disparas, puedes hallar gemas o una tienda. Al final de cada nivel tienes la oportuidad de tres mejoras (o dos dependiendo del estilo que tomes), dichas mejoras modifican al personaje y hacen que, por ejemplo, atrigas gemas cercanas o que las tiendas aparezcan m\u00e1s frecuentemente. La variedad de enemigos del juego no es tanta, pero suficiente en cada parte el pozo. El juego da la posibilidad de cambiar la paleta de colores al gusto de cada usuario (aunque deben ser desbloqueadas). En cuanto a m\u00fasica no est\u00e1 ni bien ni mal. El juego se puede jugar lento o r\u00e1pido, pero se disfruta m\u00e1s de la \u00faltima forma. Es dif\u00edcil, aunque si consigues pasar el juego te tomar\u00e1 unos 20 min (pero morir\u00e1s VARIAS veces en el intento).\nLo malo es que las hitbox no est\u00e1n muy bien definidas, pero no le quita mucha diversi\u00f3n.\nLo recomiendo si est\u00e1s de acuerdo en morir muchas veces y en poner listos tus reflejos, de lo contrario lo seguro es que no lo disfrutes.\n8/10", "timestamp_created": 1448579364, "timestamp_updated": 1456022373, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.999599", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19295059": {"recommendationid": "19295059", "author": {"steamid": "76561197966936214", "num_games_owned": 838, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 519, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482648322}, "language": "english", "review": "Best platform for this already fantastic game.

Think of Nuclear Throne/Binding of Isaac style randomization but with an emphasis on skilled platforming and combos. This game defines \"easy to learn, hard to master\".\n\nPros:\n-GREAT soundtrack, makes you feel amped up while playing.\n\n-The potential for huge combos is just absolutely nuts. Combos build up when bouncing on enemies without touching the ground, like a genocidal take on \"The Floor is Lava\". Jump on enemies and scenery alike, take damage to reload your Gunboots, continue combos between levels, it's a surprisingly deep mechanic that encourages you get creative. And that's before we get to item synergies! Check out some speedrun videos for this game, it gets pretty nuts.\n\n-XP Progression, meaning that even if you suck at first, you still unlock new content if you keep at it. Very appreciated compared to games like Spelunky, which wall off new content unless you actually beat the game.\n\nCons:\n-Somewhat \"trial and error\"-y, as some descriptions don't do a good job explaining things (IE, weapons called \"Noppy\", and characters described only with the word \"floaty\"). Even after a bunch of runs, I'm still not entirely sure what that heart balloon does.\n\n-Since most of this game is falling at high speed, it can be difficult to react to threats. This can lead to some frustrating moments, such as landing on an un-stompable enemy for damage because you couldn't react in time.\n\nBottom line, this game is dirt cheap, and is an excellent timewaster. It's simplistic graphics hides a surprisingly deep combo system, and you can end up sinking hours into this game without realizing it.", "timestamp_created": 1448516018, "timestamp_updated": 1448516018, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.540859", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19278844": {"recommendationid": "19278844", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065848254", "num_games_owned": 192, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 104, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474519848}, "language": "english", "review": "undertale for meth addicts and nuclear throne players", "timestamp_created": 1448510766, "timestamp_updated": 1448510766, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499964", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19278493": {"recommendationid": "19278493", "author": {"steamid": "76561198179862677", "num_games_owned": 35, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 103, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1460593067}, "language": "english", "review": "A wel done rouge-like where a young boy falls down a well and monsters inhabit it.

I may be wrong, but this is the only example I can think of where a platformer was designed to go top-to-bottom rather than the other way around, and while I don't consider myself enough of an expert to definitely say that this is the first such game, it certainly embraces that idea and executes it remarkebly well. \n\nYou are a person, who I guess I'll just call Downwell, who comes across a well and decides, as we all would, to just jump into it. The goal is to get to the bottom, and as you can imagine, progressing through the level is no longer the main challenge - now the problem is surviving the drop, for the well is populated by worms, frogs, turtles, ghosts, floating skulls and various eldritch beasts. Luckily, Downwell has gun boots for some reason, and for some other reason, you can find modules that modify your shots. Some are standard, like the machine gun and shotgun, others are way overpowered, like the puncher or the triple, and others downright sabotage you, like the laser. Of course, you may disagree regarding which modules are good depending on your play style, but you'll always be tempted to get the module anyway, because modules always either heal you or increase your ammo charge. \n\nThings aren't all that simple, though, because some enemeis cannot be shot and must be pounced on, while others can only be defeated with the gun boots. Adding to the strategic nature of the drop are the upgrades you get after each level, and here each player will have his favorites as well, although one strong criticism of the game is that certain upgrades - like the increased range / accuracy upgrade and the upgrade that makes your bullet casings deal damage - are almost completely useless. \n\nAs you go down the well, you also collect gems, which are used to buy health and charge at shops, motivating you to try and take on the tougher enemies who give out more gems. They also unlock color palettes and play styles, the former a purely cosmetic element which is nevertheless a nice touch (I like the blue Aqua palette), and the latter giving you certain pro/con combinations that allow further experimentation (I'm a fan of the boulder style myself).\n\nIf you're worried about Downwell being a roguelike, don't - this is the first time I've felt a roguelike is not only almost always fair, but also damn fun to play even when it isn't. It's a wonderful game which combines a few simple ideas to make a surprisingly sophisticated and addictive game that I imagine we all will continue to enjoy and experiment with for years to come. For example, I only recently found out that by pouncing on enemies and objects in succession starts a combo which, when long enough, gives you extra gems. It's hard to pull off, but incredibly fun and satisfying when it works.

Personalmente me quedo con la predefinida; tras un rato jugando tu cerebro ya asocia que lo blanco es bueno, y lo rojo es algo que merece ser disparado.

I certainly wasn't expecting a fast, challenging twitch shooter that has a surprising amount of depth for a game about falling down a hole while firing off gunboots. If gunboots doesn't have you sold right away, I'm not sure anything else will.\n\nDownwell is a platforming shooter where you'll spend most of your time descending deep down into said well, encountering enemies that you either have to stomp on or shoot while collecting gems to buy power-ups. As you descend through the procedurally generated levels you'll come across throngs of enemies that can be shot, stomped or have an invulnerability to one or the other. Your gunboots start off as a basic little pea shooter with a small magazine, but stomping something, like an enemy or torch, or landing on solid ground will reload your magazine, though reloading can also be achieved through upgrades awarded to you upon level completion (which I'll get to shortly). The graphics lend themselves quite nicely to the fast paced nature of the game, their chunky Commodore 64 style allows you to see incoming obstacles clearly and react accordingly, since enemies are easily discernable between one another, and the color scheme only further helps differentiate what's bad and what's safe. For example, the default color palette has your character and stompable enemies colored solid white, while gems and hazardous things to touch are colored a stark red in contrast. This means that even when you reach new level sets with new hazards, it's quite easy to deduce what can or cannot be stomped, like sharp coral or fiery ghosts. You can unlock more palettes upon death or game completion when your collected gems are tallied up towards a milestone goal, but many of the color schemes are horrifically garish, some of them downright painful to look at.\n\nYour character's movement is borderline perfect with enough loose floatiness to your jumps, while firing your gunboots provides sharp, sudden control when needing to redirect yourself in a hurry. You'll come across side rooms during your descent which will contain either a shop to spend your gems for health and extra gunboot magazine charges, a room with a pile of gems for the taking, or a room that contains gun modules that will give you a point of health or some charges in addition to changing your gun type. There are a handful of gun types that you can obtain but you can only use one at a time, ranging from a beefy machine gun to a vicious laser which can grow stronger if you collect enough gems to reach a 'gem high', a multiplier/enhanced character state where your gunboots are super charged, doing more damage and having larger bullets depending on the weapon currently equipped. Each gun type also has different attributes for the kickback received, jolting you up which can often mean the difference between stomping an enemy and taking damage. You can also go for combos, where you're rewarded with bonus gems, health and charges for killing multiple enemies in a row without landing on solid ground - excluding ground connected to a side room. Then there are upgrades you can choose from at the end of each level, which include your stomps becoming explosive, your character being put into a time stopping bubble upon taking damage, becoming able to consume corpses for extra health and more.\n\nWhile the number of gun types and end of level upgrades aren't very numerous, this means it doesn't take long until you know exactly what you're doing and what upgrades to immediately shoot for to tackle the challenges each level brings. Your play style probably won't vary with each new run since death is very likely, and you generally are stuck playing in the same ways; you may play cautiously, focus on avoiding ground as much as possible in order to rack up combos, go completely Rambo and brute force your way, or a hybrid of tactics depending on what the situation is. While other rogue-lites suffer from the issue of getting 'lucky' and having a superb run due to a lone item that makes your character overpowered, Downwell manages to avoid this folly by having character upgrades be incredibly useful in their own ways, not just flatout game breakers - Not to mention the game relies on quick, twitchy reactions and raw playing skill, which is a breath of fresh air. The jetpack is great for when you unload a full magazine and need to save yourself, but it can run out of fuel until you land on something again. The drone may be a great buddy to have for fire support, but it can kill the very enemy you were hoping to stomp on to reload your gunboots.The amount of player skill that Downwell demands while also supplying a surprising amount of depth is astounding for such a little game, and it's all punctuated by being able to restart a failed run in no time at all.\n\nWhat's frustrating is that my only real complaint about Downwell is that sometimes hit detection between the player character and enemies can sometimes be a bit unreliable, especially when coming at them from an angle.

It came out of nowhere, showed up costing way less than it deserves, and is a very solid roguelike platforming experience. With 4 worlds and a surprise at the end, it keeps me returning to play again and again.\n\nIt looks very simple, with a three color palette, but you can soon customize this in a variety of ways. There are several playing styles to unlock as well, to suit your own.\n\nIt's not simple at all. There are a ton of systems in the game and decisions to make, more than you realize at first, and as time goes on you will make these reflexively based on what works best for you. You have to manage your downward velocity, either by bouncing off certain enemies or firing your weapon. Based on your weapon and energy, you need to decide how fast you want to fire. Based on the color and behavior of the enemies, you have to decide whether to bounce off them, shoot from a distance, or run the hell away. Do those enemies leave corpses, and can you do anything with those? Will you avoid hits and try to get yourself more maximum HP with extra food and weapons, or will you focus on getting extra energy? And, if the floor goes away for a while and you're running low on ammo, what then?\n\nIn every other platformer game, I hate pits. I find the concept anger inducing, making you suffer for issues you can't even see. But in this game, you have complete control. Sure, you're falling down a very long well, sort of an endless pit... but you're taking control of your life while you do so.\n\nI wouldn't want to play this on anything but a keyboard or a controller, the controls are good but I wouldn't trust anything needing this kind of speed and accuracy on a phone or tablet.\n\nIf you like a challenge, buy this game.

At night and by myself (not in the workplace). I know that some of them may find this offensive. But it\u2019s a compliment. Plus, it\u2019s not like I have rapey fantasies (I GREATLY dislike the porno sex). I treat the ladies right in my awake dreams. And in my sleep dreams, too. \n\nI can see us right now. \n\nImagine two of us at some venue. Someplace where levity reigns. And we\u2019re laughing. \nAnd later on, we end up at her place, where she pulls me to her couch.\n\nWhat happens next depends on the lady. Different women have different fantasies, waiting for me to make real.\n\nAnd as you look at the screenshots for Downwell, you may think that it\u2019s just The Sims with lesser graphics. But there are many subtle differences, altogether making the games quite different. For one thing in Downwell, instead of being about running a family and their home, you\u2019re a white man falling down a VERY long well. Also in The Sims you have a massive wardrobe, along with careers for characters; while in Downwell you\u2019re just the one dude (presumably unemployed or vacationing), and you\u2019re naked except for the boots you wear with the guns in them. This is very different from The Sims, where usually you have to use starvation or drowning or guinea pigs to kill your characters. The Sims doesn\u2019t let you kill via any guns attached to boots. Downwell is Japanese. The Sims is American.\n\nI like imagining myself taking off the heels (or boots) of my coworkers, and kissing up the inward sides of their legs. \n\nWhile with some of the ladies, I like to imagine holding them from behind, placing my hands and stroking wherever it feels right. And while doing this kissing the side of her neck and just behind her ear, compelling her body to want to fall backwards, as her mind focuses on the touch of my nose and lips and hands. Sorta like when you fall down the well, and you finally get to the 2nd level; and it looks spooky! There are ghosts and skeletons!  \n\nIt\u2019s so satisfying seeing yourself masterfully make your way through those enemies, through the side shops, and finally to the next floor.\n\nAlthough I have heard people complain about the colors. The graphics are fairly minimalist (it may take three seconds for you to download the game). Enemies you shouldn\u2019t touch at all are red (at least on the color pallete I\u2019ve stuck with), while the others are the other main color. White by default. I\u2019ve noticed games critics complain about it being too samey, setting players up for visual confusion and unfair deaths. I agree that the deaths can feel unfair.\n\nBut you should never see the fairly solid color of a co-worker\u2019s skin as a bad thing. Her skin tone makes her more interesting. And if a rare color, exotic. (Remember the green lady from the 2009 Star Trek film?) From one\u2019s body, I just want it to be healthy. And I want her to be happy. I want to make her Very happy. Happier than she\u2019s ever been with any other man, or woman. My coworkers deserve that. And not just the lady ones, but the male ones, too. I can be open-minded (for my sexy coworkers).\n\nWhich reminds me, Downwell strikes what seems a near-perfect balance between simplicity and complexity.

It's clever, brutal, and inspired, all the while feeling original. The premise, if you don't know by now, is simple. Descend down the well using your gunboots and various platforms to slow your descent. Enemies are both interesting and varied, providing a robust challenge that to the point of this review (~3 hours played on and off) has kept even a moderately skilled gamer like myself from reaching the end.\n\nThis is a simple arcade game on its face, but once you spend some time with it, you really start to see just how much of an attention to detail the creators have. It's a masterpiece, from its mechanics, to the gems, to the addicting challenge, and all the way to something as minor as the freaking music that plays when you enter one of the many store-zones scattered around the game.\n\nDownwell, without a doubt, is my favorite game of 2015. Not just because it reeks of arcadey nostalgia. Not just because the various music tracks are buried into my head. Not because it's wholly original in its design. But because it has ALL of those things. Downwell is my favorite game of 2015 because, simply put, it's perfect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy are you still reading this shit?

Also the animations are really great.\n[*][b]Being procedural[/b]: As much as I prefer handmade levels, the \"always different\" aspect is crucial here as the game has literally no story at all and boy, it's been programmed really well. The game mechanics are simple, so the game needs constant changes in order to keep being fresh. Just like f.e. Binding of Isaac.\n[/olist]\n\nHowever there are also some minor issues: FPS drop when invincible (I feel like it has been programmed that way but it's not good at all) and no DirectInput support - if your pad doesn't support XInput, you'll need x360ce (or InputMapper in my case).\n\nOverall it's a great game, definitely worth the full (3$) price.", "timestamp_created": 1446486915, "timestamp_updated": 1446487026, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18841254": {"recommendationid": "18841254", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970314107", "num_games_owned": 1136, "num_reviews": 409, "playtime_forever": 211, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1447555116}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm pretty sure you can make a retro platformer out of literally any concept. Only the best games fully marry their concept to their gameplay, however. Downwell has you as an adorably animated little dude plunging to the bottom of a mysterious and randomly-generated well, armed only with his gunboots. Yes, those are boots that shoot things, which means Downwell almost plays more like a vertical shooter than a platformer. The well is full of enemies you can stomp Goomba-style or blast with your boots, though each one behaves a little differently. Red enemies can't be stomped, and a few white enemies can't be shot. So, as you're weaving your way past the strange, forgotten ledges of the well, you really need to be focused on what you're fighting and how to fight it.\n\nEnemies leave behind gems that can be spent at stores to regain health or get more shots. Additionally, you can find weapon capsules that give your gunboots a new shot pattern AND a small health or ammo bonus. These add up over time to help grow your character; every 4 points of health you collect while at max HP extends your max HP by 1, and your shots help slow your descent and make it easier to deal with tougher enemies. Hard-hitting weapons like the shotgun and laser also use huge chunks of ammo at a time, so at the beginning of the game you might only have two shots before stomping or landing to reload, but by the end you might have 4 or 5 at a time. Additionally, after each of the game's 12 levels you can pick an upgrade from a random set of three, and these REALLY have a big effect on your playstyle. They can grant ammo from collecting gems, additional attacks from breaking blocks, a drone buddy that works like an Option from Gradius, rocket jumps, jetpacks, and more. Picking smart upgrades makes a big difference, especially when facing the boss at the end of the game.\n\nThe 12 levels are split into four thematic areas, each with its own unique challenges. I won't spoil what they are, but the latter two areas have new mechanics that prove quite challenging and require you to adapt quickly. And that's what's really going to determine how much you enjoy Downwell, your ability to manage chaos. Everything is rendered in loving detail, so at any given time there are monsters attacking you, shots flying, gems bouncing, shell casings tumbling, and more going on on the screen. Once you start to master the game you can rack up some amazing combos by ping-ponging from enemy to enemy without touching the floor, for which the game will reward you richly. There are new character styles and color palettes to unlock via your total gemcount, and a hard mode with new enemies and challenges once you beat the base game. Any fan of platformers or roguelite games will find a lot to love about Downwell, and I guarantee you'll be spending more time than you'd ever expect to mastering its clever moves.", "timestamp_created": 1446484615, "timestamp_updated": 1446484615, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.595012", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18841058": {"recommendationid": "18841058", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970329288", "num_games_owned": 1751, "num_reviews": 965, "playtime_forever": 22, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1446462498}, "language": "english", "review": "A non-biased quick look @ the game:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3G6I7OU2xY\n\nIt might look simplistic but don't be fooled... it's an absolutely fantastic game.

While down the well you must make your way farther down by jumping on enemies heads, and shooting them with your gun\u2026 shoes\u2026 YES! That\u2019s right, gun shoes, they simultaneously kill enemies and propel you upward to make sweet combos. All along the way picking up gems, alternate guns, and upgrades to make you, and your gun shoes even more suitable for your traitorous terrain. Speaking of terrain every time you start the game, the levels are procedurally generated giving you and your trusty shoes a new challenge to overcome. The random levels plus the fast paced gameplay give this game a \u201cone more time\u201d effect making it incredibly addictive.

While only a very small number of indie efforts from Japan really make it over the various ponds, this right here is a shimmer of hope that there are more little masterstrokes like this out there and that more publishers like Devolver will make the effort to seek them out and make them known to a wider audience.\n\nEven Downwell has room for tweaks, sure... World 2 seems to be the hardest to me, or maybe the most unfair because the enemy types are just so damn unpredictable (how I hate those huge burning skulls) and Levitation Mode should maybe just be called Easy Mode but every minute I spent with the game made me more and more aware of how much attention to detail and loving craft went into its design.\n\nShould you break your combo chain because you seriously lack some cash? What weapon suits your playstyle best? Why the hell is that balloon shaped like a heart but never gives you any love?\n\nBefore really getting into Hard Mode I have to take a break for a few days though - this game will deliver some of the most frantic 10-15 minutes of your gameplaying career.\n\nKeep on munching those corpses!\n\n\n(Looking forward to playing your next game, \u3082\u3063\u3074\u3093\u69d8)\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1446167366, "timestamp_updated": 1446167366, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18752351": {"recommendationid": "18752351", "author": {"steamid": "76561198109511994", "num_games_owned": 313, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 312, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451108757}, "language": "english", "review": "Such a fantastic game for so cheap!

In the best Japanese game created in the last 30 years, that is as influential as the first [i][b]Super Mario Bros[/b][/i][/h1]\n\nWhen Shigeru Miyamoto designed the original [i]Super Mario Bros[/i] in 1985, there was a true intentionality behind it of disrupting every single rule and convention to the date. The key to understand the design philosophy behind Super Mario Bros is the turtle in level 3-1. Until [i]Super Mario Bros[/i] all in the Japanese games was about scoring, creating a small and enclosed world where every single element had a purpose.\n\nBut Shigeru Miyamoto realized that he wanted to evolve the games to much more complex universes. Worlds not being restricted to a single screen. So for him, the scoring wasn\u2019t the primal focus anymore, being only a second layer in its design philosophy.\n\nWith [i]Super Mario Bros[/i], Shigeru Miyamoto had in his hands a perfect and memorable game for scoring purposes, an unforgettable arcade experience. But he didn't feel in the mood for creating games with restricted rules while he was working at the same time in its design for the ambitious universe of [i]Zelda[/i]. So, he intentionally put a turtle in the level 3-1 that serves to achieve an infinite score, like a punk act of insurgency. A turtle that was destined to change the videogame history.\n\nAnd then, after 30 years of this murder of the classic arcade committed by Miyamoto, comes [i]Downwell[/i]. That it\u2019s not only a game so well constructed and that it\u2019s so joyful to play as [i]Super Mario Bros[/i], evoking the same sense of magic seen in Miyamoto\u2019s masterful creation. But that it\u2019s also a game that like [i]Super Mario Bros[/i] 30 years before, tries to revolutionize the Japanese industry turning it around every misconception and previous rule. In a certain manner, [i]Downwell[/i] can be seen as an intent to reverting all the things that the influence of [i]Super Mario Bros[/i] changed in videogame history. It\u2019s infused with he same punk spirit of trying to break every known rule, the same spirit that we can see in the level 3-1 of [i]Super Mario Bros[/i].\n\nThe game starts as a declaration of intent from part of its creators, saying to us that they know Nintendo history, that they love Nintendo EAD creations, but they also know that previously to the success of Miyamoto, Gunpei Yokoi was a fundamental figure to understand the history of videogames. The minimal color palette used in [i]Downwell[/i] has the same philosophy that can be seen in the creation of the original Game Boy, when Yokoi was obsessed with the idea of suggesting things and evoking a broad range of sensations, via the use of a limited number of colors to suggesting abstract shapes that the player needs to reconstruct in his imagination.\n\nIf [i]Super Mario Bros[/i] was all about horizontality, [i]Downwell[/i] centers its design in the idea of verticality. By looking at the original [i]Kid Icarus[/i], one of the most iconic Gunpei Yokoi\u2019s creations. And the references to Gunpei Yokoi don\u2019t stop there, as in the first level we can see enemies that resemble the original Metroids. But wen can also meet turtles that we can\u2019t shoot, needing to jump over them. As if the developers want to say that they prefer a pre-Miyamoto world when the scoring was the most important thing and that they enjoy enclosed and simplistic worlds. But at the same time they also feel an enormous respect for the Miyamoto\u2019s creations.\n\nBut with [i]Downwell[/i] being a love letter to Nintendo and Gunpei Yokoi\u2019s creations, the game also has a mesmerizing sense of action and a frantic intensity in its shooting parts that it\u2019s on par with Sega\u2019s mid-90s greatest classics. Sometimes, playing [i]Downwell[/i] you can feel this particular Nintendo magic, of a game in which every design concept fits perfectly creating a captivating flow. But also this sense of enjoyment and almost hypnotic trance that you could feel the first time when you played [i]Sonic the Hedgehog[/i]. Or some of the most greatest Megadrive\u2019s action titles created by emblematic studios like Treasure or the Konami team responsible of [i]Contra Hard Corps[/i].\n\nThis Sega\u2019s greatest classics feeling is emphasized with a brilliant synthetized soundtrack with some dissonant and noisy fragments that resembles Motohiro Kawashima\u2019s compositions for [i]Streets of Rage 3[/i].\n\nAnd if [i]Downwell[/i] looks at Gunpei Yokoi as a game designer, it also looks at Yokoi as the man making cheerful toys. Trying to be not only as fun as a toy, but also as easy to learn and enjoy as a toy. With a masterful control scheme designed with only 3 buttons in mind. Adding another disruptive note respect to [i]Super Mario Bros[/i]. Because in Mario, with the act of jumping we ascend vertically. So it\u2019s necessary to keep pressed the button. But in [i]Downwell[/i] we\u2019re most of the time failing, taking the brilliant decision of using the same button for jump and shooting purposes. [i]Downwell[/i] has a control scheme so smart and intuitive, so precise and exquisite, that playing it becomes an unforgettable experience. One of these rare games that you can\u2019t stop playing.\n\nAnd then it comes all of its masterful lessons in game design. It\u2019s incredible how the creators have inserted so many variables in such a simple concept. Every enemy adds a new challenge and needs a different approach. Every weapon or item obtained in a random basis that looks at [i]Super Crate Box[/i], can completely modify the gameplay structure. You will never cease of discovering new weapons, new subtle and small details inserted in the structure of its levels, new tricks to improve your score. And the random nature of the game only increases this sensation of master class in game design. No matter its random structure, every single run in [i]Downwell[/i] is perfectly crafted. Every element in its gameplay fits so well that you could not believe it until you play it.\n\n[i]Cave Story[/i] and [i]La Mulana[/i] were two Japanese masterpieces, extracting its greatness from looking at past titles and creating gaming concepts by imitating the classics. But I think that [i]Downwell[/i] is a leap forward from past Japanese indie games. Because it not only looks at an amazing period in Japanese videogame history, but also looks at the contemporary occidental scene. Taking its influences from creators and studios like Vlambeer or Edmund McMillen. Resulting in a title that is destined to lead the actual Japanese scene, being its main referent.

Whether or not that's a good thing depends on you, but for me the hook of this game isn't getting ot the end (though that's a part of it), its the god-like feeling you get when you reach your next max combo and the feeling of progression in unlocking new styles and pallets. If you're the kind of gamer that loves score-attack type games, mixed with some platforming, this is most definately for you. \n\nBasically, if you have even the slightest inclination, just try it.  It's the price of a sandwich.\n\n\nHowever, I do have some issues/suggestions for the developer. \n\n1) Variety: It takes about one hour to encounter/use all shop items/upgrades/guns, which I think is a problem. I understand that one can't expect a BOI or Nucear Throne level of variety form a 3 dollar game, but I think this is still an issue that the developer should maybe focus on for future dlcs/updates.\n\n2) Unlockables: More stlyes? Custom Palletes? Please? I would love more complex styles that have real trade-offs. This is all fodder for future dlc, which I would buy in a heartbeat.\n\n3) Screen space: super-super nitpicky, but the borders don't fit the whole screen when in fullscreen. I respect the size of the game itslef, but the presence of ugly black bars on either side of the border art really urks me off.  I would really love for this to be fixed in the future.\n\nAll-in-all, it's a great lunch-break rogue-lite with some minor issues.", "timestamp_created": 1445834702, "timestamp_updated": 1445834702, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504913", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18689533": {"recommendationid": "18689533", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007239254", "num_games_owned": 3805, "num_reviews": 98, "playtime_forever": 1073, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451530714}, "language": "english", "review": "Simply Downwell is a roguelike descent game but that really doesn\u2019t paint this game as illustratively as I would like.  I would rather describe this games as the vertical corridor sections in Metroid but you can only go down and it all happens very fast.\n\nThe game isn\u2019t exactly the best looking game out there but a few minutes into your first play through it is abundantly clear that there is something to this retro inspired action game. As you descend the well stage by stage you are assisted by a pair of gun boots you are wearing (God knows why). These are useful firstly to kill enemies but also to help keep you afloat. As you progress through the game you can upgrade you boots contra style by picking up power ups and the weapons are all different enough that you will soon find your favourites. When I first started playing I spent most of the time shooting almost constantly as I fell and looking for the most powerful weapon but pretty soon you realise this isn\u2019t the best tactic. Firstly because shooting also breaks blocks which you need to land on. Without platforms to land you might land on an enemy or miss a shop neither of which is a desirable outcome. The other important thing about landing is landing recharges your boots and this is needed to progress through the game. You eventually find a confident but thorough pace through the game\u2026 well until you get to stage 3 where everything runs under a time limit anyway. \n\nThe game obviously draws a fair amount of visual comparison from the Metroid series. While it obviously has a Spectrum look to it the vertical \u201ccorridors\u201d scream Metroid as do the enemies that look like Metroids along with the other variety of Metroid type creatures that inhabit the well. \n\nThere are no continues in the game that spreads over 5 stages each split up into 3 sections and upon death you find yourself back up at the top of the well. At the end of each sub stage you are given a choice of upgrades ranging from a jet pack that slows your descent, an ability that shoots bullets upwards when you collect gems, a knife and fork that lets you eat enemies to replenish health and a drone that mimics your bullets. \n\nAll powerups and shops are in side rooms protected by time freezing barriers. This gives you time to recuperate amongst all the craziness. \n\nAs you play and gain gems a number of different styles and palettes are unlocked. Palettes simply change the visual look of the game. Whilst a fun little distraction the original colours are by far the best and I never really found myself inclined to use any others. The other unlockables are in the form of styles. These slightly alter the gameplay such as removing shops in favour of weapon upgrades or giving you more health at the expense of power up choices. While these are a distraction I found myself usually going back to the standard style.\n\nDownwell is hard, but it is incredibly addictive and I found myself playing it again and again and again. At only \u00a31.99 or your regional equivalent this really is one of the best game to money ratio games you will buy this year. Downwell is fantastic and I really cannot recommend it highly enough\u2026 more please.\n\nFor our full video review please follow the link: http://www.thegametutor.co.uk/videos/game-tutor-grades/151026_game-tutor-grades-downwell\n", "timestamp_created": 1445826773, "timestamp_updated": 1445826773, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506230", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18688812": {"recommendationid": "18688812", "author": {"steamid": "76561197984646908", "num_games_owned": 253, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 207, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1458790082}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is AMAZING for $3.00.

It's a quick, snappy game which you can literally load up and go in a couple of minutes.  The graphics, while two bit, still convey the needed information.\n\nEach run begins with a descent, and ends with a descent.  It's a constant downward movement, and unless you're patient with your gunplay, you'll miss gun upgrades, which will either heal you or increase ammo, as well as change the bullet style.  Each bullet style offers different things, and you will be quick to latch onto a favorite.  There are also the occasional shop, letting you trade in gems earned for provisions and ammo.\n\nGoing deeper into the run, and as you play more with the particular bullet styles, you start to develop habits.  Machine gun is the best for some jump combos, which the game rewards for racking up several kills without so much as touching the normal ground.  Laser is for the ridiculously power hungry who just want to annihilate everything in their path, and it's glorious to do so.\n\nThe gun styles can also compliment the styles of play as well.  A floaty style with machine gun results in a heap of combos, while the more patient with lasers will appreciate the tanky approach of the boulder style.  This kind of play results in waiting for a shop to fly by, or to wait for reverse engineering so you can collect upgrades without fear of changing.\n\nThe end level upgrades also provide a nice incentive to finish, and some will synergize well with particular shots.  The easy to run out Shotgun and Laser bullets will appreciate the extra air time the Safety Jetboots offer once they're depleted.  Most styles will synergize with the upgrades as well, except for Handstand.\n\nThe game offers a lot of variety in terms of areas.  And each of them demand their own playstyle.  The first area is a sort of tutorial area, to let you get used to the mechanics of the game.  Later on, they start throwing curveballs until the point where there is little ground to land on safely.\n\nAll of this can be your's for three goddamn bucks.

This is an 8-bit style Rogue-like vertical shooter that is very simple in its core design, but very deep in how you can approach it and is rock hard.\n\nOriginally a mobile game (though the PC version is quite good quality), there are only three concepts in this game, moving side to side jumping and shooting. Your goal is to reach the bottom of each level, avoiding or taking out as many enemies as you can, with the goal of reaching the last level and beating the boss. Difficulty ramps up very quickly though so getting to the final boss will be no small feat and will require lots of replays. You will acquire and purchase various upgrades along the way but as this is a Rogue-like, they will only stay with you until you die and then you have to start over again with nothing. There is a persistent progression mechanic that unlocks different colour palettes and a few rule modifications to mix up the challenge.\n\nSessions tend to last for only a few minutes each and the quick nature of the game play and the feeling of improvement through iteration really gives this that \"Just one more run!\" feeling. You'll find yourself sitting down to kill a few minutes, only to find out an hour blinked by without you noticing. As hard as the game is, I never found myself getting frustrated or angry, even though I died repeatedly. A good Rogue-like should be tough but also feel fair and responsive and Downwell absolutely does. The controls are sharp and tight and when you die, it never feels like it was because the game cheated you.\n\nDownwell is presented in a very faithful NES 8-bit style. It runs at a constant 60fps and it looks and sounds like it could be running on an NES. The music and sound effects and are very crunchy with a lot of punch to them and compliment the game play very well. I played this on my laptop with Intel graphics as well as my main gaming rig and it ran fine on both. I suspect this will run on a potato.\n\nThe best part is that this is only $3! This would be a steal to me at 5 times the price and I can't recommend it enough from a value perspective. Even if you aren't sure you'll like it, there's practically nothing to lose. If you're a fan of Rogue-like mechanics and/or arcade, lightning-fast mechanics, get this, seriously. I'm having a blast and will likely put many more hours into it.

In general, I like getting 1 hour per dollar spent on games. For Downwell, that'd equate to three hours of playtime.\n\nWhile I presently haven't reached that point yet, I expect I'll be getting more than my money's worth out of this game, and so do recommend it overall. That said, no game is perfect, so if you'd like to get into the nitty-gritty of the game, keep reading.\n\nLike many Roguelikes, Downwell has an itemization system and a bit of a character development system, along with varying characters known as \"Styles\". The most intriguing of these systems is the itemization one. While most other Roguelikes tend to have some overlap between their item pools (or only pull from one pool) (i.e., Risk of Rain, Binding of Isaac, etc.) Downwell has a separate item pool for its shops, caves (side areas that grant a weapon and/or health/ammo), and end-of-level rewards. That is to say, you cannot buy a weapon or passive upgrade from a shop, nor can you obtain shop-upgrades when you complete a level. This introduces a fairly restrictive system overall for character development and, I believe, cuts into the game's overall longevity, as you run into the same types of items in the same places, rather than mixing things up and keeping it random.\n\nThe items themselves are mostly good, however Downwell fits right into the mold of Roguelikes in having a few items that are simply crap. Think Spike Strips from RoR, or The Poop in BoI. \n\nAs far as gameplay goes, Downwell is very fast-paced, which is a huge plus for me but may not be appealling to others. Between combos, precision jumping, the Gunboots, and using all of these things at once, a player can (and will need to) be quite active in the game. Unfortunately, some of the hitboxes are in my opinion somewhat wonky, for lack of a better word. Sometimes I'll be able to kill an enemy by hitting them diagonally, other times I'll take damage. Also, there is no enemy/player overlap prevention, meaning that enemies can stack on top of each other (leading to very confusing situations; for instance, an enemy which can only be killed with the Gunboots may be ontop of an enemy invulnerable to Gunboots) and that enemies can stack on top of YOU (leading to situations in which you may take more damage than you should because that one flying enemy followed you around during your retreat). In this vein, the collision of the Gunboots blasts is also a little funky. You cannot shoot enemies that are slightly overlapping you, leaving you very vulnerable in those situations, and many Gunboots weapon types are not especially accurate (even with the accuracy upgrade). Downwell is heavily precision-oriented, but given how much irregularity there is in collision detection for entities/bullets, the required precision of Downwell often becomes a nuisance. Hopefully this can be fixed/adjusted overtime with patches.\n\nOverall, I recommend and enjoy Downwell and look forward to playing it more. I can easily see myself investing 20-40 hours into this game, which, for a $3 price tag, is a steal.", "timestamp_created": 1445397664, "timestamp_updated": 1445398027, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516071", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18593564": {"recommendationid": "18593564", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004083305", "num_games_owned": 113, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 538, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480970327}, "language": "english", "review": "Downwell is a unique take on both the platformer and regenerating level genres.

At no point does it feel like the game is cheating, or punishing you for mistakes *it* made.\n\nAnd that's part of what makes the game so compelling. It's easy to dismiss J.

Your goal going down the well is finding gems, and with those you can buy upgrades in shops that appear as you traverse down. You also get upgrades from occasional siderooms and when you make it out of an area.\n\nI've yet to beat the game, but I'm having loads of fun with the different ways you can travel down the well and there's a lot of charm to it. You can unlock different styles (your character in a different pose) and palettes (different colors) while you play.

You could compare it to Binding of Isaac or Spelunky in that both games go deeper & deeper underground & as you get deeper the game's difficulty goes up!  You also will probably die a lot.  \n\nGAMEPLAY\n\nYou will be falling a lot but you will need to hone your senses so you don't fall too fast or miss the all important upgrades along the way.  You could probably play this game with an Atari controller if you have one.  All you do is Move/Jump/Shoot & the latter is done all with one button.  Upgrades are always given once you finish a level but they can be found in Shops & Caves which are all guarded by a Time Warp Circles that freeze time as long as you're in it.  As you keep playing the game you earn points that give unlocks for new games but you can only equip one at a time.  These are fairly simple but can have both pisitive & negative effects such as increasing health while lowering your upgrade choices after each level.  \n\nYou collect GEMS as well which you spend at the shops that are usually at the beginning of each level.  As you progress shops get less & less common. They sell food & weapon upgrades.  If you are full health & eat food you gain 1/4 of an extra health point.  Once you get 4/4 you get +1 Overall Health.  This means you gotta not get hit in order to increase your health which is easier said than done.  Enemies are rampant & will group up against you if you let them.  You can also find ammo/gun/food upgrades in caves or at the end of a level.  It might be best to try to find everything you can because a gun upgrade can also give you food or an ammo upgrade along with it.  \n\nRED = DANGER  If you get hit by a red enemy or part of the enemy that's RED you will take damage.  Red terrain also means there's a trap of some kind so you will need to keep your guard up while moving down the well.  You can safely jump on WHITE terrain & white parts of enemies. Whenever your feed touch the ground or an enemy your ammo gets replenished. So you could shoot a red to death, jump on a white then proceed to shoot another red.  If it's RED shoot it, if it's WHITE jump on it.  Some parts are a tad confusing, though.  Like a white skeleton throwing white bones & since you're white it's easy to lose track of yourself amidst all the chaos going on if there's a lot of enemies.  \n\nOVERALL\n\nEverything about this game is great!  It feels retro & brings forth that nostalgic feel if you're an old fogey gamer like me.  It even has cosmetic changes where you can make the game look like it's running on a Commadore 64, GameBoy or even Virtual Boy.

Go on and buy it!\n\nDownwell may look really simple, but actually packs quite a lot of gameplay for its price. The base game is as simple as it gets. Move left and right and press once to jump, and a second time to shoot down from your gunboots. Some platforms can be destroyed. Some platforms can be shot through. Most enemies are killed by jumping on them (except the red ones, shoot those instead). Collect crystals dropped by fallen enemies. Get to the bottom of the well without loosing all your hit points, or it's game over. Death comes quickly if you make too many mistakes.\n\nWhat makes the game interesting are the weapons, the items and the powerups. Weapons are found in little caves off to the side of the well. Some are more powerful than others. I personally love the laser. Overpowered? Nah. :) Some caves contain shops where you can buy items to restore hit points or add more shots to your boots. Each well you complete rewards you with a choice of one out of three powerups, which stack up as you move from well to well. Some of them are really cool and combine in interesting ways. The challenge is to try and hold on to those powerups for as long as you can before you inevetably die and have to restart.\n\nThe controls are responsive (as is essential for this type of game). The graphics are very minimalistic and are likely to run on a toaster. The sprites are nicely animated.

Starting with the visuals.  For a game whose active play area is a vertical shaft, they've done a great job as making the space outside the play area both both functional and attractive.  I don't have to wander far from my character to see my health or number of bullets available.  And the inclusion of various backgrounds to fill out the area is a nice touch.  I, for one, really enjoy the simple 3-color aesthetic (Luftrausers is similar, but contains a lot less contrast).  And the ability to swap the palette is great, especially for people who might be put off by the default one (which I am not, I love it.)\n\nThe sound design is great.  No action is ambiguous, and every sound effect feels natural.  The music is really good.  Too good, because I wish there was more of it (like Spelunky has a rotating list of tracks per area, I wish Downwell did, as well).\n\nThe controls are \"tight\" as one might say.  Very intuitive and responsive.\n\nThe enemies are varied enough to keep you on your toes.  You can't just chain-bounce everything, but you also can't just go in blindly firing off your gunboots.  The area variation is really good, too.  All the guns feel good, and are well balanced.  \n\nOverall, it's a really solid game, that's lots of fun, and could get away with being sold at twice the price, so for $2.99 it's a no-brainer.

It is very action-packed and fastpaced... sort of.

Also, the levels are procedurally generated so of course you will see the layout of the level of bricks, powerups, and enemies placed at random parts of the well when playing through each level. So far the game has a nice replay value if you did include the randomization of level generation and highscore leaderboards.\n\nThe price is a downright steal for such a unique arcade game and this being a debut of 23-year-old Ojiro Fumoto is a rather impressive game for such an awesome price.

It also uses procedural generation nicely, making each run somewhat different so that it's not a matter of memorization, while avoiding the pitfalls of boring or obnoxious auto-generated content - I didn't run into any in the three hours I've spent with the game.\n\nMuch like old action games, it's also not all that long - only 12 short levels and then a boss fight - but it's rather heavy on replay value with all of the times you'll die before making progress. There's also a hard mode you can unlock once you've beaten the final boss once, which makes shops more expensive and fills the levels with more enemies, including a new variety or two on each set of levels. Especially considering how inexpensive it is, I recommend Downwell to anyone who liked the simpler action games of the early console eras, or people who like \"roguelike-like\" action games in general.\n\nEDIT: I beat the game and unlocked hard mode so I figured I'd edit its description into my review.", "timestamp_created": 1445155587, "timestamp_updated": 1445217712, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.540309", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18543687": {"recommendationid": "18543687", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069244288", "num_games_owned": 192, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 329, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 14, "last_played": 1513486106}, "language": "english", "review": "A must buy for the asking price.

H\u00f6h\u00f6h\u00f6h\u00f6 (Ja, der war schlecht, wei\u00df ich selbst :/)\nDas Spiel sieht einfach aus, ist aber doch hinterh\u00e4ltig. Das Spiel animiert einen, schnell runter in das n\u00e4chste Level zu kommen, was man aber nicht unbedingt tun sollte. Wenn man zu schnell ist, verpasst man Upgrade (zu diesen komme ich sp\u00e4ter), Shops und (wenn man unbedingt alle sammel will) Edelsteine. Hier hei\u00dft die Devise: \"Vorsichtig und Sicher.\n\nDie Figur beginnt mit der normalen Waffe und 4 Trefferpunkten.\n\n1. *Upgrades*\n\nEs gibt (soweit wi ich gespielt habe) 2 Arten von Upgrades. Die Passiven (die auf die Spielfigur bezogen sind) und Aktive (welche auf die Waffe der Figur bezogen sind).\n\n1.1 *Passiv*\n\nWenn man einen Level-Abschnitt \"durchgefallen\" ist, kann man sich ein Upgrade von 3 (oder auch mehr, wenn man das Upgrade danach dann hat) aussuchen, diese k\u00f6nnen sowohl mehr Leben geben, k\u00f6nnen aber auch unterst\u00fctzen indem dich ein Droide begeitet, oder du Leichen zum Explodieren bringst, wenn du auf sie schie\u00dft.\nZu erw\u00e4hnen w\u00e4re noch, dass man die passiven Upgades beh\u00e4lt, wenn man ein neues erspielt.\n\n1.2 *Aktiv*\n\nAktive Upgrades beziehen sich wie gesagt auf die Waffe der Figur. Sie ver\u00e4ndern das Schussverhalten der Waffe. Ohne Upgrades hat die Waffe ein Verhalten wie eine normale Handfeuerwaffe mit einer Schusskapazit\u00e4t von 8 Sch\u00fcssen, was sich aber \u00e4ndert, wenn man ein Upgrade aufsammelt. Die Upgrades sind in kleinen Boxen die mit einem Buchstaben gekenntzeichnet sind.Ein paar Beispiele:\n\nS = Shotgun (Schrotflinte: kurze Distanz, gro\u00dfer Trefferbereich und eliminiert Gegner meist bei dem ersten Treffer)\nB = Burst      (Drei-Schuss-Bertieb: 3 Sch\u00fcsse hintereinander, punktgenaues Zielen und t\u00f6tet wenn alle 3 Sch\u00fcsse treffen)\nL = Laser      (Laser-Schuss: Ein langer Strahl, punktgenaues Zielen und t\u00f6tet auch meist beim ersten Treffer)\n\nEs gibt noch weitere Upgrades die man finden kann. Erw\u00e4hnenswert ist noch, dass sich die Schusskapazit\u00e4t mit dem jeweiligem Upgrade ver\u00e4ndert.\nIm Gegensatz zu den passiven Upgrades k\u00f6nnen die aktiven Upgrades nicht gesammelt werden, das hei\u00dft: Wenn man ein Upgrade einsammelt, verschwindet das Upgrade, welches man davor hatte.\n\nDie aktiven Upgrades findet man in kleinen H\u00f6hlen, welche am Rand des Spiels liegen und mit einer Blase am Eingang makiert ist. Wenn man in dieser Blase steht,ist die Zeit au\u00dferhalb der Blase angehalten, das hei\u00dft, dass Gegner bewegungslos stehen bleiben.\nNoch zu erw\u00e4hnen w\u00e4re, dass wenn ihr ein Upgrade aufsammelt, es euch einen Trefferpunkt wieder gibt.\n\n2. *Edelsteine*\n\nEdelsteine erscheinen, wenn man Gegner get\u00f6tet hat, ein Gegenstand der irgendwo stand zerst\u00f6rt hat oder einen Stein, welcher einen Edelstein in sich hatte zerst\u00f6rt hat.\nDie Edelsteine k\u00f6nnen in unterschiedlichen Gr\u00f6\u00dfen vorkommen, was soviel bedeutet wie : Gro\u00dfer Edelstein = mehr Punkte.\nWenn man genug Edelsteine in kurzer Zeit eingesammelt hat, wird die Figur \"Gemhigh\", bedeutet dass die Sch\u00fcsse mehr Kraft haben und mehr Schaden austeilen. Am Ende des Spiels helfen dir Edelsteine neue Modi und Farbpaletten f\u00fcr das Spiel freizuschalten.\n\n3. *Gegner*\n\nNat\u00fcrlich gibt es auch Gegner die einem den Abstieg erschweren (w\u00e4re ja sonst langweilig). Das k\u00f6nnen am Anfang kleine Quallen sein, auf die man nur springen muss, oder kleine stachelige Gegner die man lieber abschie\u00dfen sollte.

While in the air, jump becomes shoot, and the character shoots guns from its feet. Landing allows to reload. Pretty straight-forward.\n\nAnd then, a ton of little details come into place. Some enemies can only be killed by jumping on them, some enemies can only be killed by shooting at them, and the information is graphically conveyed to the player through a color code. There are different kinds of weapons in side caves (the shotgun feels amazing) and different upgrades to choose from at the end of a level. Those upgrades add a lot of flavor to the game and change the tactical possibilities, such as rocket/fire jumps that kill enemies but also destroy blocks. Each set of levels is very different further down, adding new dangers and enemy behaviors.\n\nThere is a second system that allows to upgrade the character, which takes the form of shops that sell health and weapon charges (more charges permit to have more ammo while in the air, and thus to shoot a few more bullets). Health is very precious as there seem to be little ways to recover it, however shops always sell a few health points. Other ways to get health are  a slight chance while occasionally picking up a new gun, and there is an upgrade that allows to eat enemy corpses. And even that upgrade is not overpowered as it forces the player to take risks in order to touch enough bodies in dangerous areas. The health in shops pushes the player to actively seek out gems, which is the currency of the game. Gems obtained through a run also count to a permanent progression system, unlocking new color palettes for the graphics, and new styles/classes (such as a style with more health, but less upgrades to choose from). When a certain amount of gems has been reached, there is some sort of frenzy which allows the player to earn more gems for each enemy killed and new gems obtained keep the frenzy going. Similarly, doing combos without touching the ground has a chance to get health back. Thus the game subtly pushes the player to play better and take more risks!\n\nEvery little bit has been polished and it shows. The controls are tight and the character is perfectly maneuverable, the game feels great, fun and accessible while requiring a lot of skill to progress farther through the levels. The enemies and upgrades are all well thought out and balanced. Finally, the game is very cheap, so there is little reason to hesitate if you enjoy platformers with a healthy dose of skill!", "timestamp_created": 1445071991, "timestamp_updated": 1445197054, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.659145", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18520309": {"recommendationid": "18520309", "author": {"steamid": "76561198100335794", "num_games_owned": 98, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1663, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509955283}, "language": "english", "review": "Downwell is single-handedly the best game I have ever played.

Your only weapon is a pair of ultra-cool [b]Gunboots[/b] that help you by both slowing your fall and shooting up monsters. It's insane, and I love it.\n\nThis is the first commercial release by [url=https://twitter.com/moppin_]Ojiro Fumoto[/url], a Japanese indie game developer. It's obvious that his game design has been influenced a lot by Vlambeer. It's got all the right ingredients: simple gameplay that's easy to learn but tough to master, the addictive qualities of an arcade game, and lots of screenshake. If you like to compare games, the best way to describe this is like a mix of [i]Nuclear Throne[/i] and [i]Super Crate Box[/i].\n\n[i]Downwell[/i] isn't an easy game. It's fast paced with a good variety of hazards and enemies to fight. Some can be killed through headstomps [i]Mario[/i]-style, while others can only be dispatched with your Gunboots. There are 4 different levels with 3 stages apiece (as well as an endboss), and each of them have different themes that challenge the player. However, you can't save your progress at any point with checkpoints or files: you need to perform perfectly if you want to beat the game. It's not impossible; beating a stage will let you choose from character upgrades [i]Nuclear Throne[/i]-style, and you can find different gun modules that change up your weapon. Like [i]Super Crate Box[/i], weapon pickups are a risk/reward affair. They all handle differently from each other, and you may prefer some to others so much you might skip some. The catch is that they will always give you an upgrade of either refilling your HP or increasing your max ammo capacity. Combined with a selection of 5 different playstyles to choose from, this game ensures that each run you have will be fresh and fun. Playthroughs usually last anywhere from 5 - 20 minutes, which keeps you coming back for more. It's perfect for players who like to invest their game time in short bursts while requiring quick reflexes and providing unique experiences.\n\nThe production values for this game are [b]excellent[/b]. [url=https://phlogiston.bandcamp.com/album/downwell]Eirik Suhrke[/url], the composer of [i]Spelunky[/i]'s soundtrack, put together some amazing chiptune tracks. [i]Uroburos[/i], the first level's song, features some great Gameboy-like bass and a great catchy beat to smash monsters to. The music perfectly sets the stage for a strange but epic journey into the depths. It sounds foreboding, but it's never dreary enough to turn you away. Coupled with the great sound design by [url=https://twitter.com/KissaKolme]Joonas Turner[/url] of [i]Nuclear Throne[/i], this game feels extremely satisfying to play. His gunshots and explosions are full of punch, and every sound you hear else fits right in with the game's aesthetic. I almost wish he had made more sound effects for all of the monsters, like cries of pain as you stomp and shoot them into oblivion. The bitcrushed shrieks and laughs are sure to give you chills. The visuals are cute and minimalistic, sticking to a 3-tone color palette that still conveys all the right information to the player. Enemies are highlighted with a blend of 2 colors, while tougher ones stick out with 1 bold tone. Though they aren't highly detailed, the animations bring so much life to all of the characters. Everything about this game [b]feels[/b] great, and it's nice to know that they put such love and care into the design of a simple game.\n\nNot everyone would like this game, though. It's really difficult, and it can discourage new players from the beginning, especially since there's no saving. The high skill ceiling might keep you on the first few floors for a while, so practice is crucial to moving on to the later parts. Some may find the pixel graphics unimpressive and hard to read because of the lack of coloring. There's other small problems with user interface, like a lack of personal control binding and no option to reduce or remove the screenshake. Some of the finer mechanics like wall-jumping, combos, and increasing max HP are left ambiguous to the player as well. You might complain that it feelsl ike just another mobile port from the lack of support, but fortunately, the developer has promised to change up the interface in future patches. \n\nStill, even if you're on the fence about playing this game, I'd recommend to everybody to get it. It might be the best game I've played all year, and it's only $3 and available on mobile. Plus, it also tends to go on sale quite frequently, so it's definitely worth a dollar or two to grab! It has tremendous replay value and the amount of work put into it is very admirable. It's been applauded by many other indie devs (who have probably made some of your favorite games as well), including Derek Yu of [i]Spelunky[/i] and J.W. Nijman of Vlambeer. It was made by one guy who lovingly paid attention to every detail and knows exactly how to design a fun game. It's a work of art that has simple but distinct mechanisms and a lot of moving parts, and once you understand how it works and how to best play it, it flows like music. I love it, and I hope you do too. It's definitely one of my favorite games of 2015.\n\n[b]TL; DR:[/b] For fans of [i]Super House of Dead Ninjas[/i], [i]Probability 0[/i], [i]Spelunky[/i], [i]Nuclear Throne[/i], [i]Super Crate Box[/i], and good games in general. :)", "timestamp_created": 1445030830, "timestamp_updated": 1479967343, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 43, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.754555", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18511087": {"recommendationid": "18511087", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025037510", "num_games_owned": 3766, "num_reviews": 116, "playtime_forever": 74, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476432757}, "language": "english", "review": "https://youtu.be/Tqd18gSyY0c\n\nDownwell is as straight forward an entry into the rogue-like style as it\u2019s name suggests. You play as a young boy who jumps down a well in search of treasure. Armed with your trusty gunboots, you must journey deeper down this well, destroy the many enemy creatures, as well as collect all the gems you can as you inch closer to the final boss. Along your path are random time safety bubbles that hold more treasures, alterations to your gunboots, as well as various stores you can spend your found treasure at for things like extra health.\n\nThe basic game play may seem like it gets old pretty quick, but the glory of Downwell\u2018s design is the additional boosters you can pick up, not to mention the tight, frantic combat that occurs as you plummet uncontrollably down the well itself. After each section you are given a choice between three power-ups (more if you happen to get the power-up that allows for more power-ups to choose from) that alter your game play. These include random safety time bubbles upon being hit, a drone to deal extra damage, even just health refills or simple things like dead bodies firing a random bullet, or even the ability to eat said dead bodies to slowly regain health. There\u2019s also the option of a balloon, but it\u2019s more just a random cosmetic accessory that easily pops than anything all that beneficial.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the combat punishes you for moving fast. There are a lot of times where enemies will begin to swarm you all at once, forcing you to descend a lot slower than you might want. This actually works in your favor, causing you to have to think out a plan to avoid being hit, or how to reach certain enemies since you might not be able to jump above them and fire with your boots, or have enough room to not get hit while attacking them. This title also does run on Super Mario Bros. rules as far as that fighting system goes, allowing for a number of foes to be defeated by jump/landing on top of them. However, there are a few that cause damage if you do this, such as the spike shelled snails on the wall, the random Space Invaders looking bat, or the floating glowing orbs, so you still have to be somewhat vigilant in how you dispatch these creatures.\n\nThere\u2019s also the unlockable elements the gems provide, such as the various palettes you can earn that crawl the span of early gaming graphics. Much of them revolve around the days of the Nintendo Entertainment System or the Sega Master System, but you can unlock others like \u201cGBOY\u201d, a black and green Nintendo Gameboy style, as well as \u201cVBOY\u201d which, as you would guess, is the all red line against black background look of the failed Nintendo Virtual Boy sans the three-dimensional aspect. Even the screen is heavily condensed to represent an early arcade machine look without going overboard and including a fake glass layer with reflecting flourescent lights from the background.\n\nSadly, there is only one difficulty available upon purchasing. There is no easy or hard mode available right out the gate, nor do I think an easy mode even exists, really. Downwell seems to move along at a standard medium difficulty setting, but you can unlock a hard mode [which I have yet to do] for a grander challenger. But, even at medium difficulty, Downwell is still a pretty tense game, one that will have you struggling in the first set of stages alone despite the many side rooms that offer a bonus health and gunboot upgrade, or downgrade based on your weapon preference. Thankfully gems also unlock new character designs that come with additional boosts or restrictions to add more tension or to make things a little easier.\n\nDownwell is a very well constructed title with tight controls, battles, and even visuals. At launch, you can pick this one up for three dollars (US currency), and, honestly, it\u2019s well worth the investment. While the unlocks are often minimal and visual alterations, the difficulty and learning curve really leaves more to discover about the game than just what you happen to see. The only major problem to be had is that the music for each set of stages seems fairly short, having to repeat itself more than you would like, not to mention also sounds like many other memorable scores like the flying ship stages of Super Mario Bros. 3 and the opening notes of the Final Fantasy VII victory battle theme. But, if you can look past those minor things, you will find a great deal of fun in this small package, making Downwell an addicting reverse Ice Climber style title that is well worth diving head first into.", "timestamp_created": 1445029767, "timestamp_updated": 1445029767, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.466667", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18510766": {"recommendationid": "18510766", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012009261", "num_games_owned": 2418, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 67, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1446665540}, "language": "english", "review": "It's published by Devolver Digital & priced at $3.\n\nDo I really have to say more?\n\n(For those who don't know Devolver Digital.

The only thing this game needs is more content, but because it only costs 3\u20ac, that isn't meant as criticism. This game is so addicting and satisfying to play, the sound design is especially great. Also the upgrades you can choose from after every stage are all useful and fun, which isn't the norm with rouge-lites these days. The unlocks you get from your playthroughs are a bit dissapointing, especially the color palettes which just change up the colors a bit and probably weren't even a huge effort for the developer. If the game had a ton more upgrades, they could lock some of them away as unlocks, which not only rewards every single run, it also motivates new playthroughs. I think when you beat the final boss you unlock a \"hard mode\", but that's about it.\nDownwell is small, simple, it doesn't try to do much, but what it wants to do it does exceptionally well.\nI hope there will be a big expansion for this game, with tons more upgrades to choose from, more levels, more unlocks, different game modes, and of course more weapons. It would be cool if you could also upgrade the weapons or something like that.

Very fun. You can find weapon upgrades for your gunboots in the form of: lasers, burst, shotgun, triple, punch, and more.

I suppose it could be described as a rogue-like game. All the money you don't use goes towards pallete and style unlocks.

It takes a while to get to know the different enemy types and how to approach them, but they are all managable and the colour coding is cleverly done. Any enemy that is almost entirely or entirely red can not be stomped and has to be shot to be killed. The enemies also have a nice variety in how they move, keeping you on your toes.

You get weapons (similar to contra's style.  There's various siderooms with nodes that have a letter on them, corresponding with what the gun is.), powerups between stages(3 stages in 1 level), and can even buy items with benifits from shop rooms.  \n\nCollecting coins lets you not only buy from the shop, but also moves you toward progressing on permanent stuff like color schemes (Default, Aqua, Green, Gameboy Classic, Virtual Boy, etc), similar to how Luftrausers works.  You also get a few alternate guys to pick at the start.  They all have pros and cons, with the default being the most generally well balanced.\n\nThe art (and controls) reminds me of another Devolver game, Luftrausers. The art style is simple but well done, and is very pleasing to the eyes.   The various color schemes you can choose really help enchance the game and let you personalize it.  \n\nSimilar to Luftrausers, the platforming is very fluid and I feel like if I die its entirely my fault.   That's how a platformer/roguelike should be.   My main complaint is weird hitboxes with the bats, but everything else feels solid.\n\n\nThe rng isn't too heavy, while still making the game fun and exciting.  What upgrade is going to be in this sideroom or what upgrade will I be able to choose?  It's small rng, but for the most part is controllable.\n\nOverall, if you like fun/addicting games to play in short burst, then Downwell is a great choice.

As you may guess by the name, Downwell is a game about... well, falling down a well. What initially intrigued me about downwell is one of the core mechanics of the game, your gunboots. They act exactly as they sound and allow you to fire shots out of your feet, attacking enemies below you. The main focus of the game is trying to make it as far as you can without dying. Downwell has some aspects of a \"rogue-lite\" type of game, such as randomly generated levels. As you fall, you will also occasionally encounter side areas and shops that might contain upgrades and gems that are used as currency. Some items might simply increase the number of shots you can fire from your gunboots before you need to reload, while others change the way your gunboots work, such as adding rapid fire or causing them to fire in a shotgun-type blast.\n\nNow that we've covered the game mechanics themselves, let's talk about the game's controls. The game feels like a dream, the controls are extremely responsive and I never once felt like I didn't have control of my character. In addition to jumping and moving around, if you are near a wall and jump away from it, you can wall jump for extra height. It all feels extremely natural.\n\nThe combat itself boils down to jumping on enemies a la Mario, and shooting them with your gunboots. Some enemies have spiky shells that prevent you from jumping on them, requiring you to use your gunboots on them. You have a certain number of shots that you can fire with your gunboots before you run out, at which point you can reload simply by landing on the ground (or an enemy). Some enemies maneuver their way above you, causing problems that way and forcing you to either get above them to attack, or keep moving downward.\n\nThe game's difficulty felt spot on, to me. Between the combat and the controls working extremely well, I never had a death that I felt I didn't deserve. \n\nThe game's sound is top-notch. The sound effects of the gunboots feel absolutely perfect, and really added that extra punch to the combat. The music itself felt spot on, too. It really fit the game without feeling distracting or taking me out of it.\n\nOverall, the game is a ton of fun to play, and I would highly recommend it. For only a few bucks, it is an absolute steal, and it's on both PC and iOS, with an Android version in the works. You should definitely check it out. Thank you guys for watching, and I'll catch you next time.\n", "timestamp_created": 1444927562, "timestamp_updated": 1444927562, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502542", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18486136": {"recommendationid": "18486136", "author": {"steamid": "76561198131256347", "num_games_owned": 102, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 129, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1448814063}, "language": "english", "review": "love this game\ngo play it", "timestamp_created": 1444927374, "timestamp_updated": 1444927374, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18486038": {"recommendationid": "18486038", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018473131", "num_games_owned": 404, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 294, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504535841}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u6fc0\u30e0\u30ba\uff01\u4e95\u6238\u4e0b\u308a\n\u306a\u306e\u3067\u3059\u304c\u3001\u4e00\u6642\u9593\u307b\u3069\u904a\u3093\u3067\u308b\u9593\u306b\n\u30e0\u30ba\uff01\u4e95\u6238\u4e0b\u308a\n\u3050\u3089\u3044\u306b\u306f\u306a\u308a\u307e\u3059\n\n\u3082\u3046\u3061\u3087\u3063\u3068\u9811\u5f35\u3063\u3066\u3000\u30e0\u30ba\uff01\u3000\u3092\u6d88\u3057\u53bb\u308a\u305f\u3044\u3067\u3059\u306d", "timestamp_created": 1444926964, "timestamp_updated": 1444926964, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.542169", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18486032": {"recommendationid": "18486032", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019651249", "num_games_owned": 1054, "num_reviews": 73, "playtime_forever": 1517, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1464449477}, "language": "english", "review": "Raw, incredible fun.

I have 30% of the game unlocked.  I wanted to modify my review to be a bit better reflection of the game. If you want the super short review: The game is very good, even at full price. If you want the short 'comparison' review : the game is like The Binding of Issac, or Enter the Gungeon in spirit and replay-ability. Starward Rogue and those other two games I would consider the best top-down rogue games currently available on steam. For a side scroller: Rogue Legacy is good.\n\nSo now a further examination of this game:\n\n[h1]Gameplay and Fun[/h1]\n[b]10/10[/b]\nLets face it, this is why you play a game like this. This is going to be affected by the quality of the levels, enemy variation, 'responsiveness' and controls. The developers have done a lot to improve upon the genre. Secret rooms are not as much of a guessing game , [spoiler] they are glowing tiles you shoot with a missile rather than cracks in walls, or something even more obtuse like in Gungeon. [/spoiler] . there's plenty of different characters to pick from out of the gate. they are different, and fun. One very esoteric (and challenging) bot controls time. The game only progresses when you move. Really interesting feature.\n\n[h1]Roguelite-ness[/h1]\n[b]8/10[/b]\nThis is its own category, because it merits discussion. Is the level generation algorithm good? Well offhand it looks like a modified BSP tree, and it works well. the levels balance well. They generate quickly, more quickly than BOI did. The item synergies feel good, and the path to progression being a combination of leveling, shopping, hunting and luck seems to be a nice mix. I havent had many 'broken' runs. Small modifications to the level, such as teleporters at the ends of leaves in levels to get around are nice additions, and make the game less tedius when you are in a run. \n\nI will say that the very jarring increase in difficulty on level 5 even in normal mode is pretty surprising. Why did I take off 2 points? \n\nFirstly I wanted to see more thematic variation between levels. This is something BOI and Gungeon do well. The levels ARE different, but not [b]very[/b] different. This could be improved.\n\nSecondly, because of the intersection of sound and procedural generation. I'll explain more in the next section.\n\n[h1]Music and Sound[/h1]\n[b]6/10[/b]\nIn most roguelite games this is the most overlooked thing, and it is here as well. Firstly, the sound is adequate, and the music is adequate. Its not 'bad'. Its just a lot of missed opportunities. The music track does not change thematically much from room to room. Exceptions are the silence in sacrifice rooms, and a few other notable things. Otherwise the track just seems to sort of play. The music was offputting at first -it felt like a 90s rave dance track. Over time its grown on me, and I'd even say its fitting of a mirthful bot-game. Some ways it could be better? How about change the instruments when health is low? What about changing the instrumentation based on the room enemies? Like a big powerful monster is a low booming synth, lots of little bots are like arpeggiators. By picking the 'robot' genre you have so much possibility to tightly couple the music and sounds you hear to what the player sees and experiences. Missed opportunity for greatness here, but not categorically 'bad' either. Its barely above average, hence 6/10\n\n[h1]Programming and Stability[/h1]\n[b]5/10[/b]\nOk I am a programmer, so I can probably weigh in on some of this. Firstly a TON of options are exposed in the settings and menus and thats just awesome. Hats off. There are some issues with UI scaling at large resolutions that needs to be configurable, and also issues with very wide monitors as well. the second part is more forgiveable.\n\nThings like collision detection, and overall physics seem to be 'ok'.\n\nWhen it runs the game performs well, and you can see you usually are getting 100s of FPS. So that's good.\n\nThe low score however is due to frequent crashes, which is unfortunately unacceptable. Not sure what is the right move there.\n\n[h1]Art[/h1]\n[b]7/10[/b]\nThe art is good, but not 'amazing'. The bots look cool, the usage of 'energy' projectiles was smart, because the game gets a glow-y tech-y vibe. Befitting of a bullet hell game.\n\nI do feel like the projecticles coudl benefit from more animation. Sometimes the projecticles looks like a lot of very static lifeless decals. What if the glow pulsated? what if the projecticle spins as it comes to you? some Do but a lot of them look rough. On the other hand the projecticle 'pathing' is awesome, and they make very interesting fun patterns.\n\nThe ship is neat, and I like that you can see through the floor. It does take a little time to learn which tiles are traps. There's a spike trap that I did not 'percieve' as a trap until I had already been hurt by it. Again. Animation could fix this. what if the spikes popped up? Its moving so i know its dangerous.\n\nOverall the art looks good, but the game needed more animations to convey its ideas.\n\n[h1]Overall[/h1]\n(each score out of 10)\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [th]Gameplay and Fun[/th]\n        [th]10[/th]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Roguelite-ness[/td]\n        [td]8[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Music and Sound[/td]\n        [td]6[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Programming and Stability[/td]\n        [td]5[/td]\n    [/tr]\n        [tr]\n        [td]Art[/td]\n        [td]7[/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]\n\nAverage: [b]7.2[/b]\nThe game is WORTH the money at full price, and is VERY fun. its a shame this game has not achieved the popularity of other titles in the genere.

I've got to mention the soundtrack, though. I guess it's some kind of ambient trance or something (I'm not very good with names), and even though it felt weird in the beginning, it actually fits the action quite well. Alas, there are very few tracks, which to me is the only downside of this game.\n\nGameplay-wise, it's really refined. The game has an excellent progression curve (even though you'd better get familiar with danmakus if you weren't in the first place.) There's lots of enemies, which all come with cool, inventive patterns, and the rogue-likey character customization gets pretty relevant here. No doubt the devs were shmup addicts who wanted to give the genre some fresh air by getting rid of scoring and linear progression and adding lots of new features, and the result is lovely.\n\nFinally, the bosses really are badasses, and the fights are accordingly rewarding. Getting to the end of the game is going to be tons of pain, so be prepared. Regular not-so-hardcore players should be able to get to the end of floor 5, though, and I think for 12$, Starward Rogue's definitely worth the shot.

Player skill serves only to increasingly turn what would have been losing runs into merely boring slogs.  Starward Rogue's item pool, however, is much more tempered.  It's full of meaningful choices between good items, with nothing actively bad outside of a selection of optional, secret items designed for challenge runs.  I'm not even sure if \"bad\" is the right way to describe these items, since they all change the game quite dramatically upon pickup, often giving an entirely different experience.  The vast majority of items are passive upgrades, but you also have a good selection of primary weapons, energy weapons, missile launchers, one-time consumables, and one-at-a-time passive attachments to choose from.  It cannot be overstated how much this goes toward ensuring that every single run is enjoyable and feels empowering, giving you choices while retaining the RNG in a way that ensures the game's longevity.  You're never stuck feeling ripped off when an upgrade or weapon appears.\n\nWhereas Isaac will routinely and literally lock you out of the fun by not giving you keys to open treasure rooms, Starward Rogue bears no such grudges.  You get a choice of powerups with every level up, simply by killing enemies and finding XP drops.  Not leveling fast enough?  You can purchase XP at shops for a small fee, no matter their other stock.  And even though keycards are a thing in this game, and there are plenty of locked doors, it never feels like you're being stonewalled out of the actual experience of the game by these doors, because there are also plenty of items and shops unlocked out in the open for you.  This leads to a very nice balance where the player is still carefully considering what to spend keycards on, but is never entirely blocked from enjoying the thrill of finding cool new items and stores.\n\nStarward Rogue is not coy about telling you what you need to know.  Item descriptions are well-written and concise, conveying the necessary information to make good choices without any real trial and error.  The map (along with the colors of door frames, and tooltips when you stand next to locked doors) tells you what rooms are beyond the doors of your current room, preventing you from walking blind into a miniboss or spending precious keycards only to find out it's not a shop you wanted.  In most games like this, you have a tab open in a web browser so you can look up item descriptions and what certain rooms do, even as a veteran player.  Not so, here.  This is an incredibly considerate set of design choices, again contributing to the overall feel that the player is choosing their path and directing their run to a certain extent.\n\nThe game's variable difficulty is also much appreciated.  This is not a game that wants to shut anyone out, providing Easy and Very Easy difficulties to allow inexperienced players to gain skill gradually.  On the flipside, Normal, Hard, and Misery difficulties provide a level of challenge fit for any danmaku nerd with a string of 1CCs around their belt.  At time of writing, Misery's description reads that it is in the process of development, but the difficulty is selectable (and brutal).  This may be a potential oversight.\n\nWhereas many Isaac-lites provide a sizeable roster of characters that are largely the same and do not change the overall playstyle of the game, Starward Rogue's roster is small at 7 characters, but highly varied in style.  While weapons, attachments, and powerups are customizable, several of these mechs have built-in properties that change the way the game is played fairly dramatically.  Redshift is by far the coolest of these, in my opinion, turning the game into Superhot (where time only moves when you move or shoot).  But there's also the Humble mech, with money-powered weapons, or the Indigo mech, which uses barrier mines and magnetic missiles.\n\nWorth mentioning are two big quality of life features that reflect the overall design philosophy of respect for the player: the dash and the teleport pads.  Every mech has the ability to run MUCH faster by holding down a button (LT on an Xbox controller by default), which is not only useful in combat to outrun enemies and bullets from time to time, but also extremely great as a time saver when backtracking through cleared rooms.  Teleport pads are also included throughout each floor, networked together.  So, for example, if you're a few rooms before the boss and realize you want to check out the inventory of that shop you found earlier again, you don't have to run all the way there and back again.  You can just teleport around in a big loop until you get to where you need to be, very quickly.  Together, these features completely eliminate tedious backtracking, leading to a much better pace.\n\nFinally, we come to the core gameplay, and what's here is a treat.  At its heart, the game is a bullet hell shoot-em-up with roguelite RPG elements.  Enemies and bosses fire large, beautiful patterns that must be dodged in tight spaces, often with minimal player movement.  There are hazards in the rooms themselves, such as lasers, spikes (shards of glass? it's hard to tell), and mines, that must also be avoided while fighting.  For veterans of either danmaku STGs or Isaac-likes, Starward Rogue provides a very welcome twist on those genres.  Enemies have good amounts of health to let you enjoy shooting them and dodging their patterns, without feeling like bullet sponges.  It should be said that this game avoids many of the common pitfalls of Isaac-likes, by drawing its controls and game feel directly from twin-stick shooters.  So, no pulling a trigger button and messing up your aim every time you fire, and your shots are chunky enough that you don't need to be pinpoint accurate for the most part.  This is a carefully-tuned game on all counts, and they've absolutely nailed the game feel.\n\nThe soundtrack is excellent if you enjoy EDM, though it bears mentioning that there are only like, 3 tracks, maybe 4.  They really bump, but they might get repetitive to some players.  The graphical style is crisp and clean, with nice bright bullets that make shooting and dodging intuitive.  If I have one complaint here, it's that there's not much animation to any of the models.  Boss intros in particular are kind of hilariously lackluster, just a still sprite that zooms in toward the camera for a second and then you're in the fight, serving to undercut the tension of the coming battle.  But, you can't have it all, I suppose.  It's such a carefully-balanced and fun game, I can't help but forgive it its few flaws.  \n\nSTRONGLY recommended!", "timestamp_created": 1488270970, "timestamp_updated": 1488322105, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 29, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.753715", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30034160": {"recommendationid": "30034160", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987077975", "num_games_owned": 286, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 193, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496374464}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty decent roguelike.

So you can stop moving and shooting and take a look around. The downside is this mechs very low HP (3) which means you need to make the best out of your time control power to weave through bullets and down enemies. This mech is good for practice because you can go through the motions mostly at your own pace building muscle memory, and if you get hit then it's even more devastating.\n\nHowever you play, expect to die alot before you learn enemy patterns. This is what I'd call a good arcade style game. Each time you level up you get to pick passive perks, and you clear rooms of foes you gather credits and loot gear. There are, randomly, shops of multiple varieties to buy stuff from. There's quite a bit of gear, and what you find / buy can change your play style a fair amount.\n\nI'm enjoying it.", "timestamp_created": 1470559230, "timestamp_updated": 1470560150, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.667668", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24685090": {"recommendationid": "24685090", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023403230", "num_games_owned": 498, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 395, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486158240}, "language": "english", "review": "This is one of those underlooked gems I often see from very talented indie devs.\n\nImagine Binding of Isaac mixed with TouHou.

There aren't that many things that switch things up a lot. Yes, there's the incredibilities, but i'm talking about something like mom's knife of brimstone from TBOI. Something less normal than, say typical glass cannon aka risky assassin. Finally, rear-burst turrets. They seem like a cool idea. Turrets that shoot bullets behind you which explode into more bullets sounds neat but they easily snipe with the extremely fast bullets that then explode, thus creating the bane of anyone who took risky assassin, which removes shields and reduces you to 1 health, thus causing anything that hits you instakill you. 1 health + nigh-unavoidible damage = ragequitting. I haven't mentioned any good things about this game yet, which is because everything else is exellent, however i'll go over the best things in this fantastic game here. Updates. Updates and bugfixes come faster than holidays, even more so if you don't count every obscure holiday you can think of(or look up on google). Enemy variety. The enemies aren't typical \"flying thing that shoots bullets\"esque tropes. Laser boomerangs? Check. Slow bullets that shoot fast but short range bullets behind them? Check. Bosses that use intricate bullet patterns to create a maze and then spawn minions that use slow-moving bullets to hinder your movement even more? Check. Difficulty.  The difficulty settings range from \"Literally like 3 minutes of standing still for a boss to kill you\" to \"5 hits with bullet patterns that Touhou would be scared of\". Anyhow, I give Starward Rogue 8.5/10 for an exellent roguelike.", "timestamp_created": 1456121581, "timestamp_updated": 1456121581, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503597", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21371469": {"recommendationid": "21371469", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053911950", "num_games_owned": 107, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2254, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479156442}, "language": "english", "review": "This is an incredibly fun and well executed game.

Even if you suck at these things!\n\nOn 'Normal' difficulty, the pace of play is measured enough that navigating my way through \"bullet heck\" is as dependent on strategy as reflexes. And the variety of powerups is super cool! Every game is different after the first few upgrades. And there's such a variety that I haven't seen the same stuff twice. (To be fair, that's in two hours.)\n\nNow, I've seen enough SHMUPs to know they can be very lush and beautiful productions. Arcen doesn't do \"lush.\" But for those familiar with games like AI War and Last Federation, the graphics and controls are frankly better. Everything's clean and smooth, and it's enjoyable to discover the different variations on enemies. As with the loot, there's a whole, whole lot of enemy variety.\n\nI can't say you're in for a fantastic journey through sound. The score and sound effects are pretty basic. You're probably going to want to play your own music in the background, but I do that with lots of games, so it's fine by me!\n\nI'm playing with an X360 controller, which I imagine is how it's meant to be done.\n\nIn conclusion: I can recommend this as an amusement for casual players, especially if (like me) you're a fan of 'roguelike' genre conventions.

characters and different abilities, with randomly generated floors and items, get this game.\n\nLong version for those of you who want to know exactly what this game has to offer, and whether it excels in areas you want it to, here you go.\n\nThis game is, again, a bullet-hell game that places you in a robot that's going through several different floors on a huge station called the Megalith, which is surprisngly embedded in a sun. You get several different characters to use, all of which vary in stats (stats being your health, shields, damage, stuff like that), weapons, and some even have awesome side effects during the game. After you choose both the character and the difficulty, it drops you into a level. I'm pretty sure this game has the same floor level creation process as the Binding of Isaac. A large amount of pre-made rooms are set up, and then those rooms are randomly plotted around to create the floor that you traverse through. Anywho, the game has a lot of content right now. Lots of different varied enemies, lots of different room designs that make some rooms tricky to deal with, so on and so forth. The only thing this game lacks, in my opinion, is a lack of both MUSIC and ITEMS. The music, while awesome and catchy, does get old after a while. There are, like, 4-6 different loops (not including the boss music) that play during the different floors, and it gets kind of tiring after a while. I would really love to see more music added in the future. The next problem is the lack of items. Now, there is still quite an amount of items in the game. Different primary's, secondaries, attachments, useables, so on and so forth. Shops that offer you health/shield upgrades, and other things like that. But even with all that, there seems to be a lack of them. As I play the game more, I will change this if I notice a difference and there's actually, yknow, a LOT more then I've noticed. But until then, there ya go. It's a game that I would extremely recommend for it's price tag, and it's super fun.", "timestamp_created": 1454754930, "timestamp_updated": 1454754930, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502511", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20981365": {"recommendationid": "20981365", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960571668", "num_games_owned": 414, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 239, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1460405274}, "language": "english", "review": "Starward Rogue has a 100% 'true rank' on Steam DB, and a 99% user review score; it's well deserved. I'm tired of rogue-lites, and I don't play shmups very often at all. I am absolutely not the target audience of this game. But it is superb, best of breed, and has kept me hooked.\n\nThe variety of enemies is excellent, inspired by both the very best of bullet hell gameplay and lots of creative enemy types that provide stimulating challenges. The tutorial is good, the difficulty is very adjustable, and the different suit designs allow the player to chose totally different styles of play. The rogue-lite aspects provide you with a sufficiently unique experience each time, and are balanced to offer a consistently entertaining difficulty curve as well.\n\nThe game's length is such that if you have a bad run it isn't a waste of time, but if you're having a good time you get a really good stint of it, and it's very replayable. The graphics are solid, functional and vibrant. The music is, as typical for Arcen games, fairly non-standard but of a high quality.

Each mech has various pros and cons that set it apart from the others, and the difficulty choices encompass all types of players, whether you want a casual experience or a gruesome challenge. \n\nDungeons consists of various rooms. Most have enemies in them, which you have to kill before proceeding further, others have some kind of puzzles or obstacles such as lasers that go on and off in a pattern. You also pick up a variety of items and equipment for your mech to improve them for the duration of the run. At the end of the floor there's a boss, which you have to defeat in order to be able to descend to the next floor. Bosses all have unique attack behaviours and are generally very fun to fight. I'd say, this game is very similar to Binding of Isaac, except in a sci-fi setting. \n\nVisuals are very pretty and shiny, despite being very simplistic. At first some stuff can be a tad confusing, like the glass floors overlooking space at first seemed like death drops/impassable places to me and it's not often easy to tell which of the obstacles are destructable and which aren't. Music is all right too. There are some nice upbeat tunes here and there, but I think the music in other Arcen games is way better.\n\nIt's a simple but fun gameplay. Don't expect deep tactics and strategy like in other Arcen games (such as Bionic Dues and The Last Federation), but if you just want to have some fast-paced fun and challenge your reflexes, then the game is well worth getting.

The game takes a lot of inspiration from Binding of Isaac. The basic structure is the same, although SR adds a lot of its own twists on top of it. It's also much more intense, often having a huge amount of bullets on screen at once.\n\nThere's a large variety of weapons. You can carry one of each type at once, and swap them with ones found in chests and stores. Energy weapons are interesting in that they have a limited amount of ammo, but automatically recharge whenever you change rooms. This is a clever way to encourage using the weapon regularly. There's also an experience system, along with selectable perks. All in all, the game has a good amount of depth, without feeling overwhelming.\n\nYou can pick from six different mechs at the beginning of a run. All of them have different starting loadouts and attributes. One of them starts out with an unique ability, which pauses the time whenever you stand still. This makes the game almost feel like a turn based game. It's pretty hard to use, but it's an interesting alternative way to play the game.\n\nThe camera can be zoomed out further than Steam's screenshots show. Doing this makes the game look a lot less claustrophobic. If you're using a 1080p monitor, the game shows a good amount of distance around you by default. For lower resolution displays, there's an option to zoom out the view. This is very handy, as being able to see the bullets from further away makes them easier to avoid.\n\nThe graphics are quite nice, featuring high resolution 2D graphics. The UI has a simple look to it, making it easy to read.\n\nThe soundtrack features a variety of upbeat electronic music. They're all good songs, and fit the game's atmosphere well.\n\nMost of the game works well with a controller, but the menus were obviously made with a mouse in mind. Some of them require you to move a cursor around with the analog stick, which is a bit clunky.\n\nThere's more options than you usually see in 2D games. I especially enjoyed the option to switch to SHMUP style controls, which removes the friction from your movement. It makes the game feel a lot more responsive and familiar, for those who are used to playing bullet hell games.\n\nI recommend Starward Rogue to anyone who enjoys roguelites or shoot em ups. It's a fun game, with few flaws. It's challenging, yet the difficulty rarely feels cheap. Arcen Games has a reputation for releasing interesting, yet flawed games.

Of course, being on PC you can play with mouse and keyboard OR a twin-stick controller like a 360 pad.  It's a rogue'lite'.. meaning, in this case, permadeath and procedurally generated floors.  Similar to games like Isaac, the rooms are hand-crafted but placed in randomized configurations, with randomized enemies, pickups, loot, etc.\n\nYou will be exploring labyrinths of rooms, finding powerups to make you stronger, gaining experience by killing enemies, fighting minibosses, and looking for secret rooms.  Each floor has a final boss that you typically must defeat before proceeding to the next floor.  \n\nI don't know how many room designs were made for this game, but it seems like a lot.  Some are small and square, some are very large, long, or wide.  Some have an optional obstacle course of sorts, with prizes for those skilled enough to attempt them.  The design of the room can really change how you'll fight the enemies within.  Some large enemy that was easy to fight in a big, wide-open room may be much harder if you find him in a room that is divided into narrower corridors, or full of environmental hazards.\n\nYou, and most of your enemies, fire bullets, beams, and other ranged attacks, and the game can be a little bullet-hellish, especially on some of the bosses that I've seen so far, who shoot in very bullet-hell-like patterns. This is what I like most about Starward Rogue.. most enemies fire different types of shots, in different configurations, meaning each one is a unique challenge, especially the bosses and larger enemies.  I've also come across a few very unique and well-designed bosses that break the mold a little bit, and add even more variety.  The enemy variety is top-notch.\n\nThe weapons, consumables, and upgrades that you can get are full of variety, as well.  Aside from the fact that there are several different mechs, with unique starting configurations, that you can play as; as you play, you'll come across chests, shops, boss drops, and other ways of obtaining new and interesting weapons.  Some are objectively better than others, while some are just a matter of preference, playstyle, or the 'right tool for the right job.'\n\nYour main weapons consist of a main gun with infinite ammo, a subweapon that uses a universal ammo simply called \"energy\", and a missile launcher.  The subweapons tend to have the more unique effects (such as the Guardian Blaster, that fires a shotgun of bullets that can destroy enemy fire, as well as harm enemies), though there is plenty of variety to the main guns as well.  Missiles can be used offensively, but are often best saved for destroying obstacles that cannot otherwise be destroyed.\n\nYou can also carry one of many consumables, which each have their own effect that can be used once, and then the item is gone.  There is one slot for passive 'defensive' items.. and you can also find or purchase different robot buddies that will circle around you and do stuff.  On top of all of that, you can find all kinds of upgrade items, and collect as many of those as you like.\n\nAnd that leads me to another strong plus for me. The game is not cryptic about what items do.  You can walk over something to see what it does before you pick it up, and the descriptions are usually pretty clear and straightforward.  It doesn't try to screw you over, force you to trial-and-error, or make you check a wiki to know what you're getting.\n\nI almost forgot perks!  Basically, you gain experience, level up, and pick from one of 3 perks, similar to something like Nuclear Throne.  Simple, but another layer of complexity that may make you play your run differently, or give you more options when combating foes.\n\nTL;DR: There are lots of weapons, enemies, items, room layouts, and just lots of variety in general.  Plays like a twin-stick shooter.  Procedurally generated floors comprised of hand-made rooms, similar to Isaac, with a bit of Geometry Wars and Nuclear Throne thrown in.\n\n[h1]Graphics:[/h1]\n\nYou can see them for yourself by watching the trailers, or looking at the screenshots.  There are some really cool-looking enemies, and each floor has it's own theme to the floors and walls.  The lasers and bullets are shiny and pretty.  You can see what you're doing, tell things apart, etc.  Overall, pretty good graphics, unless you just hate 2D games or something, for some reason.\n\n[h1]Sound and Music[/h1]\n\nHere's the thing about sound effects.. when they're good, you hardly notice them.  When they're bad, you notice.  I haven't really noticed anything bad, so they must be pretty good.  Nothing has really seemed out of place or ugly, to me.  There's a nice little sound effect to let you know when you've cleared a room.  The guns go tatatatatat and pew pew and fwooosh, and the explosions go boom..  What more do you want?\n\nThe music is okay, but it's not really my thing.  After a while, I turned it down a bit and found it more pleasant to have it faintly in the background  Other people will probably love the music, it's just not really what I like.\n\n[h1]Controls and Options[/h1]\nI have played using a 360 pad, and my mouse and keyboard.  Both work good.  I may slightly prefer mouse and keyboard, but the option of using a controller is nice if I want to sit back a bit and relax, or hook up to my TV and play from the bed or sofa.  Everything is rebindable, and the bindings make sense as-is.  I like that with my 360 controller, I can shoot at any angle with the right analog stick, or at 8 compass directions by holding the face buttons (individually, or two at a time for diagonals)\n\nAll aspects of the sound can be adjusted individually in the options menu.. and there are plenty of options for graphics and performance, too.  Fullscreen/window, resolution, refresh rate, scale.. even brightness, contrast, and sharpness! Nice!  And there are toggles to turn off shadows, reflections and such for people with slower computers.  Very good job on options.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nI like this game, if you couldn't tell (duh).  It emulates the Isaac formula a bit, but definitely has its own thing going as well.  The game seems stable and I haven't noticed any bugs (except one time when the game seemed to hang on a black screen when I tried to start a run.  No biggie, at least it didn't ruin a run in progress.)  Nothing seems lazy or half-assed, and I'm struggling to think of any real 'cons' besides not personally caring much for the music, as mentioned.\n\nLike most indie games, it's inexpensive and this is certainly well-worth the price.  And you really have to hand it to Arcen Games for always trying new things, and finding ways to bring twists to old ideas.  Even if their games aren't always the most popular, they have a few hits, and this is totally one of them.  So try Starward Rogue, and tell your friends about it if you like it.  At the time of writing, it's a hidden gem, but I hope to see more people discover it and play it.", "timestamp_created": 1454091427, "timestamp_updated": 1461279128, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.533437", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20830152": {"recommendationid": "20830152", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989527798", "num_games_owned": 737, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 397, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1473761419}, "language": "english", "review": "A surpringly solid twin-stick shooter which takes inspiration from the best of the genre but doesn't just blindly follow in their footsteps.\n\nDespite being pretty skeptical about Arcen pulling it off, I've conclued very fast that, fortunately, it is a pretty fun game! You can choose from 6 mechs who have different stats and some of which also start with some weapons or special skills that makes them unique. One of the mechs literally turns the game into SUPERHOT. For the uninitiated, SUPERHOT is a FPS where time flows only when you move so it basically turns from frantic battle for survival into a very chill experience.\n\nEach mech has 4 slots, primary weapon with infinite ammo, secondary energy weapon with limited usage that refills upon entering a new room, limited ammo weapon like a rocket launcher that functions like bombs in Binding of Isaac for breaking stuff/killing enemies in emergency and lastly a consumable slot. Apart from that you can find drops that just upgrade or modify your mech without being restricted to slot.\n\nThe game starts you off at 5 floors in total, each floor is very Isaac-like with shops, miniboss rooms, secret rooms and floor boss. You also gain experience, upon leveling up you can choose a perk like becoming the Keymaster and getting 100 keys, seeing the non-special and later special rooms automatically on map or learning you gottagofast. Yes, game actually has sprint button for traversing long distances AND for use in boss fights. Some of them like the Hunter miniboss will actively chase you at higher-than-normal speed so you gotta put those mech legs to work.\n\nThe enemies use bullet hell patterns but on normal they are mostly avoidable even for someone like me who doesn't play typical bullet hell games like the Touhou series. That is, at least not until you increase the difficulty and/or get to the later floors. The difficulties alter enemy and boss patterns, among other things, which is really cool way to do difficulty tiers in general.\n\nOverall, the game has pretty rad soundtrack even if it can get a bit repetitive during a longer session and solid gameplay with plenty to do on each floor and bosses that don't feel like copypasta of each other.\n\nIt's a good choice of a time-waster whether you've already played all the usual suspects or just getting into the genre.

Every one of their titles tends to venture beyond the normal bounds of game design, mashing such disparate concepts as open worlds, puzzles, and zombies into a single title. Starward Rogue has earned the distinction of their most enjoyable game for me, perhaps because it doesn't go as far afield in design as the rest.\n\nStarward Rogue places you in a head attached to a robot body stomping around the Megalith, a giant construct sticking out of a star. You get to pick one of seven wildly different bodies, from close-combat flame-spewers to a clever thing that freezes time when you're not moving. According to the tutorial you're here to rescue some AI dude, but that never really comes up during runs. Each of those runs is a top-down descent through five randomly-generated levels, featuring rooms of all shapes and sizes and enemy configurations and deadly traps. Armed with your gun, missiles, energy cannon, and whatever upgrades and single-use items you can find, you have to blast your way through tons of enemies, bosses, and minibosses to... win, I suppose. I've beaten it a few times and you just get a stat screen.\n\nIf this all sounds a lot like Binding of Isaac, that's because this is its manic sci-fi cousin. Your enemies are colorful drones and ships that will sling thousands of bullets at you in every arrangement imaginable. Much like the Touhou shmup games, bullets can curve, seek, chain, turn at right angles, form walls or fields or mazes, or perform even more dastardly maneuvers. That means you need to be prepared to do a lot of complex dodging and narrow escapes to survive a run. The health system is luckily quite generous, giving you a pool of health you can easily upgrade and also a shield or two (much harder to upgrade) that recharges for every room, essentially free hits. You also move quite fast and can freely sprint, which is a welcome addition and gives the game a much quicker pace than most.\n\nAside from the coins and keys you'll pick up, there are three classes of weapons, passive upgrades, and consumables to find. Weapons in particular tend to be few and far between but will completely change your style of play. Some guns fire through walls, some spread like flamethrowers, and some only work in melee range. Consumables can have similarly dramatic effects, like summoning temporary helpers and nuking everything in sight. You'll also level up and earn perks, but until level 10 or so those perks won't be very conspicuous, mostly being health or ammo upgrades. Oh, and there are permanent drone buddies you can find that provide some much-needed support, but can be easily confused with your foes.\n\nAnd that brings me to my one real gripe with the game, the art style. Arcen tends to favor very bold, brash color schemes for their games, but too much variety in the palette can make important features hard to single out. Everything in Starward Rogue is brightly colored and detailed, but there's no real theme to the enemies, helpers, or even you. In huge battles everything can start to blend together, even moreso with thousands of glowing bullets flying around. The camera and the pace of your robot help keep it distinctive but I've started skipping the drone familiars because they almost always confuse me and get me killed.\n\nThe art style may be hit or miss, but the rest of the presentation is excellent. Arcen games often have somewhat shoddy menus and interfaces, but the ones here are clear and even a bit polished. All the information you need is readily available and easily navigable. There's also been an impressive amount of post-launch patches which have cleared out a lot of early bugs and jank, and rebalanced whole swathes of the game to provide a more even challenge. They even added in fast-travel around the level to make backtracking and exploring essentially painless.\n\nWhat really keeps me coming back is just how plain ol' fun it is. The raw enjoyment of blasting hundreds of robots as you grow stronger and more unstoppable is in full force here. A pumping soundtrack helps keep you moving at breakneck speed as you look for the next boss to thrash. The difficulty is pretty even-handed as well, offering five different levels and ramping up steadily as you yourself grow stronger. With hundreds of enemies to encounter, tons of items to find, seven classes to master, and plenty of secrets to uncover, Starward Rogue is a worthy competitor in the arena of roguelike shooters.\n\n\n\nDid you enjoy this review?

Or, I could forego both and choose to get more credits ($$$) from enemies.\n\nThe devs clearly love this game and are very active on the forum. I asked a question and made a suggestion and it was patched in literally 3 days later. All of the changes since launch have been positive ones, and the game feels well built as is. In an age where games are perpetually in Early Access, having a roguelike/roguelite that is a complete product is also a major bonus.\n\nAnd of course, this game is a LEGITIMATE bullet hell.

It does have the same design beats with keys and missiles that essentially act like bombs that can access secret rooms.  And it has NT's perk system when you level up.  Keep in mind though that for better or worse you can't break a run by getting essentially infinite items like in BoI.\n\nThe level design is fairly well done with the battles usually having some twist to them in terms of obstacles and layout.  The background graphics for the game can look a bit busy though, which means that you won't be able to instantly grasp what needs to be done in the room (like dodging spikes for instance).  However, you can easily see the bullets against the background, which has been a problem with some more colorful shmups.\n\nThe music is appropriately techno and fits with the mecha aesthetic.  Other than the menu (where you control the cursor with the control stick), the game works well on a controller, which is a plus.\n\nThere's also future support coming from the company itself.  And there's an active modding community that's been constantly adding more variety to the base game.  All Arcen has to do is to curate it before the created content gets patched in.\n\nSo it's not a clone.

Arcen\u2019s latest game Starward Rogue continues the dev\u2019s tradition of fusing disparate genres together, in this case arcade shooters and roguelikes.\n\nI say \u201cdisparate\u201d; Starward Rogue isn\u2019t the first game to combine roguelike elements with a shoot \u2019em up core, but it is the first I recall seeing designed around the principles of Japanese-style arcade shooters, particularly those of the \u201cbullet hell\u201d variety. That means intense, complex bullet patterns that you need to navigate through as well as enemies to defeat, and it makes for an exciting, very interesting take on a genre that all too often coasts along without any real innovation.\n\nStarward Rogue casts you in the role of a severed head in a mech as you attempt to rescue someone called Rodney from the depths of a dungeon called the Megalith. I believe these two elements are a reference to one of Arcen\u2019s other games, but it\u2019s one I\u2019m not familiar with at this time. Fortunately, no real knowledge of whatever the other game it\u2019s referring to is required; it\u2019s simply a bit of fanservice for those who have played the game\u2019s spiritual predecessor. Rodney is an entertaining character in his own right, though my only direct contact with him so far has been in the tutorial sequence.\n\nStarward Rogue\u2018s gameplay is balanced nicely between exploration and action. Each level of the Megalith is split into discrete rooms, each of which has to be cleared of enemies before you can move on to the next one. Unlike similar games such as The Binding of Isaac, though, Starward Rogue\u2019s rooms are often more than a screen wide and tall, and there are a number of unique designs and layouts that you\u2019ll encounter over the course of the game, which are then combined with various enemy and trap waves \u2014 the latter tending to be non-destroyable obstacles or gun turrets that will spew out hot fiery death as you try and take down the enemies, then deactivate when you\u2019ve cleared the room.\n\nLevelling up is a simple process: no stat allocation here, simply pick one of three randomly selected perks. These vary from increased damage to having a full map available from the start of the floor \u2014 and even being able to skip the rest of the floor you\u2019re on. Alongside these passive bonuses you get from levelling, you can also equip and upgrade your infinite-ammo main gun, your recharging Energy-based weapon (which recharges when you enter a new room) and your limited-ammo Missile weapon. There are also various other passive upgrades you can collect, and one-shot consumable items that generally have some sort of \u201csmart bomb\u201d effect.\n\nMuch like the aforementioned The Binding of Isaac, Starward Rogue is a game intended to be replayed and rechallenged. There are a number of different mechs with which to play the game, and there\u2019s a checklist of enemies and items you\u2019ve found over the course of all your runs. There are also five difficulty levels to choose from, with Very Easy all but guaranteeing a full clear run unless you are the very worst kind of incompetent moron, and the highest difficulty claiming to offer difficulty on a par with the legendary Touhou series. And on top of that there are a bunch of achievements to earn, too, so it\u2019s very much a game that will keep you busy for a long time if you get it \u2014 though it\u2019s accessible enough to be able to pick up every so often for a quick blast even if you\u2019ve left it alone for a while.\n\nI completed a Very Easy run earlier \u2014 there\u2019s no shame in starting either a roguelike or a shoot \u2019em up on the lowest difficulty, and this game is both! \u2014 and am already looking forward to giving it another shot soon. If you\u2019re a fan of The Binding of Isaac and its ilk \u2014 \u201croguelites\u201d, to use the popular term \u2014 then you could do far worse than give Starward Rogue a look.", "timestamp_created": 1453990200, "timestamp_updated": 1453990211, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499504", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20804540": {"recommendationid": "20804540", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972011136", "num_games_owned": 811, "num_reviews": 329, "playtime_forever": 60, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1455025582}, "language": "french", "review": "Le jeu propose du contenu et map al\u00e9atoire.\nUn jeu un peu difficile quand m\u00eame, et la souris pour viser est trop libre et ne tourne pas sur un axe et souvent l'on ne sait plus o\u00f9 est la souris donc le viseur.", "timestamp_created": 1453988592, "timestamp_updated": 1453988592, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20801649": {"recommendationid": "20801649", "author": {"steamid": "76561197968730214", "num_games_owned": 224, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 3522, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507776139}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a solid, fun twin stick bullet hell shooter.\nIt also includes flexible difficulty mode, an everything unlocked mode and six save slots to mess around with.\nI enjoy it and recommend it.", "timestamp_created": 1453975049, "timestamp_updated": 1453975049, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 25, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.665388", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20800439": {"recommendationid": "20800439", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004393508", "num_games_owned": 1270, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 520, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470434725}, "language": "english", "review": "Starward Rogue is fun, and worth your time and money.\n\nIt's a cross between Binding of Issac and Touhou, wherein you play as a mech shooting your way through five big levels of this starship, grabbing items and upgrades while you learn to better avoid the bullet hell patterns from the enemies.

But I digress: the standard mech is more than fun enough, presenting fast gameplay that caught me in the trap of \"one more level!\"\n\nYour mech is armed with the standard bullet hell style infinite ammo shooter that you can aim with the mouse, a missile launcher, and an energy weapon that varies by mech - the basic mech has a bouncing ball of bullets, while the time-stop one has a machine gun burst.\n\nThere's a huge variety of weapons and items - I found myself a ghostly sword that would erase bullets directly in front of me at regular intervals, and I learned to love it - up until I got sloppy with a third floor boss and died. Whoops!\n\nThe levels are randomly generated pre-made rooms - some are mazes, some are open arenas, some have laser traps and other complications, and they're populated with a huge variety of enemies, each with their own bullet patterns.\n\nNow - flaws.

It has different difficulties to appeal for everyone, I've never played this type of game and easy was well... a tad easy (there's also Very Easy.) Normal so far is pretty challenging but I'm slowly making it further and further with each successive run. Bosses are fun and each one is unique. Depending on how intense you want it you can change the difficulty accordingly, but it does seem each difficulty is a fair amount harder then the previous one (with a total of 5 difficulties atm.)\n\nSo far the game seems like it has a lot of replayability and this would be the perfect type of game to let some hours slip by without you even realizing it or just to do one playthrough, or even just a floor or a room. It's very friendly in that you have plenty of opportunities to jump in and out inbetween combat (I haven't tried doing that in combat yet.)\n\nThe Game starts off with 5 levels but you can unlock two more levels (I haven't done that yet so idk how it's done but from the impression I got you just have to beat the game a couple times.) The Graphics are good and it's easy to distinguish between the background and the neon bullets so that isn't a concern.\n\nStarward Rogue was made by Arcen and all the games I've played by them have been supported well after launch. The Devs are pretty active on their forums (Arcengames.com) so you can stop by their for questions or to chat.  The music was produced by the same person who produces all of Arcens games and it fits extremely well in here imo.\n\nLastly according to some people this feels like a really good Binding of Issac clone (again I haven't played the genre so I haven't played it) so if you like that game you'll probably like this one as a refreshing breather at the minimum.", "timestamp_created": 1453535860, "timestamp_updated": 1453628705, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547275", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20691587": {"recommendationid": "20691587", "author": {"steamid": "76561197963664525", "num_games_owned": 747, "num_reviews": 89, "playtime_forever": 350, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1473475978}, "language": "english", "review": "First off, let's get this out of the way.\n\nThis is a Binding of Isaac clone.

You move in turns, but enemies never move, so you can always plan your next move, or just run around enemies that are too difficult, or using items dig around and make your own path to the exit.

Oh the loot, I love this system. Basically, you progress the deeper you get, if you die you lose all your progress and items of that run, but if you use the Wings item you escape but lose all your loot, save for gold, stat boosts, and Artefacts. Your main goal while exploring is to get the  Stat crystals for a minor, but permanent status boost (these add up pretty quickly), and Artefacts.\n+ Artefacts are the rarest loot, and you always keep these items, even when escaping. You can start the dungeon from a lower floor, but keep your equipment you got 10+ levels higher and you're guaranteed to progress quickly through the earlier floors, gaining you a nice Exp/gold boost you can spend.\nCONS:\nSo far, I haven't really experienced anything that put me off the game, or any big \"NOPE\"s, but there's still a couple of things that I'm not satisfied with.\n- First off: I don't like the UI. It's not really a mess, but it's not pretty either, and it's definitely not the easiest one to browse through. For starters, it's not responsive to keyboard controls. This one is pretty minor, but I like to play this game on the train, and using a mousepad is hell, it would help if you could scroll through items/lists with keyboard control, but you can't.\n- Again the UI/UX, but assigning items is a mess. If you want to switch the key an item is assigned to, you cant click that item and switch to another key. You have to double click to remove it, click the item, click the key you want to assign to, and click the item(not the key) again. The same goes for the crafting menus and ingredients.\n[i]Again, minor, but a couple seconds of frustration adds up, it shouldn't be there.[/i]\n\n- The game length, I haven't finished the game yet, so this may be somewhat premature of me, but I'm on floor 80+ in about 5 hours, and I haven't really felt I've experienced all that much. The environments are by no means bland, but it feels as if they're not varied enough? I feel like I've been on the ice caves with ice enemies for about 30 floors, and tying into the point below about the skills, is that the magic elemental perks lose their usefulness.\n\n- The skill tree is honestly way less in-depth than I would've liked. It boils down to : Get Heal and fireblast on the mage side, Get all Warrior perks, get some Potion perks, and you've got basically everything you need. Once you've gotten a couple of levels the increase in strength or usefulness of further on perks(Especially mage and potion) is waaay less important than your gear, to the point of being negligible, and is pretty disappointing. The fact its smaller than it looks probably ties in to the fact to the above point, being that the game feels shorter than it should be.\n\nThe fact that most of the negatives is just me whining about UX/Inventory management is honestly a great sign I like the game.\n\n[b]Conclusion;[/b]Fortunately, this sequel is better than it's predecessor, and aside from from some minor UI flaws, and a seemingly much shorter playtime than you'd expect (Currently 4 hours in, reached floor 80 with not much difficulty so far, and a bit of -fun, not yet boring- grind.), it's still a competent, fun indie game, and although I was expecting a bit more in terms of mechanics, it still manages to make me wish for another one.", "timestamp_created": 1488564089, "timestamp_updated": 1488564089, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.605661", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30276878": {"recommendationid": "30276878", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011665771", "num_games_owned": 135, "num_reviews": 51, "playtime_forever": 1091, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498736610}, "language": "english", "review": "TL;DR: Decent game, Roll Warrior, Either rush through or go for story, some bugs, is really just a flashgame, buy on a sale.\n\n\nFirst I'd like to adress the things put as \"key features\", especally \"4 playable characters\" No. It's just skins, not characters, you can even switch between them.\nThen I wouldn't really say that the game features 3 unique play-styles, because magic is fairly useless unless you want to get the heal spell (Always gets this at first level up) Or want to Enchant weapons and armour (Which may as well just be used to get gold by selling them) and the \"scavanger(?)\" tree isn't really a play-style more than it is based on what potions do and increase drop chances for items. So, always Roll warrior with Heal spell and you're good to go.\nThe museum for the \"hardcore collectors\" aims mostly at people who wanna 100% the game, but that is pretty punishing when all you see is a question mark without anything telling you what item it is or where you can find it. So grinding through level 1-10 just to hope for some luck for that one utter random weapon that just won't drop is a real problem as you get going and outlevel everything.\n\n\nAs for the stuff premium has over the flash version?\n20 Extra floors, Complete story, New Game+ are all sweet.\n\n3 re-skins, multiple saves, and bug fixes seem less like worth it.\n\nBut it has new quests! Which is awfully implemented. Random characters will offer you something in return, often for something inside the caves which cannot be brought back out (Unless you go heavy magic leveling which sucks), and often they will disappear long ago after you've levelled up til the right level, found the right item, and brought it back with you, and whatever you get I assume isn't worth it anymore because you've outleveled the quest.\n\nIn general NPCs disappear at random it seems, not sure if it's how far you reach (Which can escalate very quickly into stupid high if you're lucky) and it feels like I'm missing story bits. Sure it's obvious that the cave kills off most people and their friends either die as well or leave the town, but so far I am really looking forwards to \"The complete storyline and conclusion\"\n\nGah this game is unforgiving with it's deaths.", "timestamp_created": 1488458084, "timestamp_updated": 1488657915, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.577154", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30151719": {"recommendationid": "30151719", "author": {"steamid": "76561198167043044", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1032, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501816525}, "language": "english", "review": "It's Lit.", "timestamp_created": 1487974161, "timestamp_updated": 1487974161, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.406207", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29966053": {"recommendationid": "29966053", "author": {"steamid": "76561198141088704", "num_games_owned": 44, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 514, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493259501}, "language": "english", "review": "As someone who started PC gaming on flash games and game websites, I was bound to run into a game I simply ADORED. Such was the case with a very simple yet extremely fun game called \"The Enchanted Cave.\" The game was released on Kongregate on my birthday in 2010, I had turned 12. I was spending the night at my friends house when we cam across it, and played for hours on end. I was infatuated with the game, and with good reason. Fun gameplay, a tad bit difficult, and easy to learn. I waited years for a second installment, hoping it would be better (if possible). Well, I recently found out that it had a second installment that I never learned about because I eventually gave up and played computer games a lot less in that time. When I saw it was on Steam for $5, I cried tears of joy. All those memories flooded me and I squealed like a little girl. I instantly bought the game (even though I only had like $9 left in my bank account), and started to play it. It was a HUGE improvement, something I thought was not even possible for a game I already regarded so highly. I've beat the game a bit ago, and boy was it awesome!!

Good for a playthrough, but late game and NG+ are heavily unbalanced.\n\nThe first thing to note about the Enchanted Cave is it is available for free as a flash game. That version of the game stops at level 80. The version on steam is the equivalent of the 'Premium' flash version, with steam achieves and trading cards added. The second thing to note is this is not what most modern people would consider a 'rogue-like' in the traditional sense. I would call this an Eastern rogue-like, closer to Shiren the Wanderer or Azure Dreams. Each run is not separate from the others, you play the same character, with certain things getting reset on the run while keeping others.\n\nGameplay wise, the game is about delving into a randomly generated dungeon. The end goal is to reach level 100 and defeat the boss there, but individual runs are about either collecting gear, levels, money, or making progress to a checkpoint. Every ten levels has a checkpoint available that can be warped to after you find it. The rogue-like part comes in that every new run has you lose all gear gained. You keep levels and money, and certain pieces of gear called 'artifacts', but generic gear and items such as healing potions and alchemy ingredients are lost. You finish a run by using a special item that exits the dungeon. If you die on the run, you are reverted to before you started the run, losing all progress made. In essence, the game is about knowing how far you can push a run before you need to leave. There is really very little luck-based about this, as you can look at monster stats before engaging them, and they stay in one place, never moving to engage you first. The main randomness is in criticals. Basically, you do runs at a level, until you acquire artifacts that let you start comfortably at a later level, making gradual progress until you win.\n\nThere is a sort of class system, with every level letting you apply points to features that either boost your warrior abilities, alchemy, or magic. Levels also raise a stat by one rank, as do crystals found in the game or later on purchased from a merchant. Gear found improves stats, and can be enchanted with items to give additional effects that aren't gained by levels, such as elemental damage/resistance and dodge chance. All of the paths seem a bit balanced, but warrior seems to coast through on minimal effort, only needing to dab in mage for a bit to grab healing until they finish that route and can do another. By the time you finish the game, you should have one path finished, and be most of the way down another.\n\nThe faults start to show when you reach the end of your first run of the game, and in NG+. Notably, levels don't scale, so you are still getting +1 attack at level 2 all the way to level 50. Notably, with gear, crystals, and the like, that means that levels mean way, way less as you go on. Raising your attack from 2-3 has more impact than raising it from 90-91. Once you get near the end, you'll pretty much have the best gear, have it enchanted the best, and find that you barely get stronger than that. This isn't a problem really, it leaves the final boss still challenging (albeit with spamming healing potions in combat, nothing is challenging). It becomes extremely broken in NG+, as you don't get any stronger gear, monsters just get much stronger, leaving your only way to advance being the less and less effective stat ups. Enchants get better, but the only enchantment worth anything by that point is instant death chance. You can easily break the game by stacking instant death and dodge, and relying on the RNG for most enemies.\n\nAs such, overall it is a well done game, and the cracks only start to show in the late game with scalability of stats.

When I saw that a sequel had not only been made, but had a Steam version too, it became one of the few times I've instabought a new release sight-unseen.\n\nThe Enchanted Cave 2 is very similar to its predecessor. You play as a rogue adventurer who journeys deep into a 100-level dungeon in search of loot, monsters and glory. Along the way, you find relics, potions and new items, and if things get too dangerous, you can always \"escape\" with a pair of magical wings and try again with the gear you collected on the way. Combat is done automatically by just walking into enemies, and there's a semi-randomized aspect to the floors you visit - no two are the same.\n\nIt's pretty impressive what the creator, one-man dev studio Dustinaux, upgraded in the interim between games. Chief among the improvements is a massive skill tree system that has three distinct sectors. You can choose to upgrade physical skills (combat, defense, experience boosts and HP), magical skills (MP, new skills) or a general utility set (gold earned, potion efficiency). It actually gets quite challenging in later floors as you gain levels, because XP gains become minimal and you have to prioritize what you want to upgrade.\n\nInstead of a simple splash screen in the original, there's now a town that you can visit in between runs, which has NPCs, shops and more. It even incentivizes the plot by making it possible to rescue NPCs trapped in the dungeon, who escape and become shopkeepers or bar patrons afterwards.\n\nFrom a story standpoint, things haven't changed much. The story is pretty much exactly the same as before - there's an evil sorcerer who lives at the bottom of the dungeon and is trying his best to kill you, via subterfuge and the numerous enemies he summons on each level. The only difference now is that he isn't so blatant about his intentions, and you can find journal entries written by him in secret areas littered throughout the dungeon.\n\nThe one thing that makes the game so good is that it's addicting as hell. There's a definite sense of \"one more run\", and you're constantly on the lookout for better gear, relics and potions. You can craft your own upgraded gear with special attributes, pick one of four character skins to use when raiding and try to fill out the \"Museum\" (a place that houses all of your duplicate relics).\n\nThere are a couple problems of note as well. Despite the inclusion of Grant Kirkhope (Banjo-Kazooie, Donkey Kong Country) as composer, the music is... underwhelming, considering his pedigree. Likewise, it can take hours to finish a run. Don't be deceived - there are enemies you physically can't pass without significant grinding.\n\nThat being said, the Enchanted Cave 2 is just as immersive and enjoyable as its predecessor. While it's not necessarily a true roguelike, it offers enough fun for anyone who's looking for an adventure with lots of variety and grinding. There's even a New Game Plus mode once you complete the dungeon for the first time.\n\nDefinitely check this one out.\n\n[i]For more reviews, visit my Curator page, [url=store.steampowered.com/curator/9888867/]Alex's RPG Recommendations[/url][/i]!", "timestamp_created": 1443139862, "timestamp_updated": 1443167474, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 27, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.718068", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18067483": {"recommendationid": "18067483", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983782940", "num_games_owned": 452, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1581, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500440872}, "language": "english", "review": "Basically the Ancient Cave from Lufia 2 and Lufia 3, refined and improved.

If you've played any endless cavern concept like Lufia 2's endless cave, or the game Azure Dreams, you might find this game enjoyable. \n\nFor anyone new to this concept, the idea is simple. You enter a cave that's 100 floors deep, you can't go back up, you can only go down and your only way out is an escape item you will find fairly early on. Some items you find, you can keep when you leave, others you lose. The cave will get progressively harder as you run out of ways to stay alive, and eventually you find yourself in a risk vs. reward scenerio. Keep going, or be happy with what you've got? If you die, you lose everything from the run. \n\nI personally always liked the idea and had fun with it so when I saw a game that was obviously based on the idea, I didn't hesitate to pick it up, especially for the whole whopping $4.99 that he's asking for. So, the question is, do I like it? \n\nYes, over all I do enjoy the game and would recommend it but be advised, this game is heavily automated. There's tons of loot and a fairly big (albeit simple) talent tree for you to fill out but combat will consist of you repeatedly and automatically attacking any enemy you walk up to. You could use the various elemental strikes you learn but I just kept my mana/MP for Healing and I was deep in the cave by the time I got any of those offensive abilities and wanted my Heal alot more than I wanted a small damage boost. You can also burn alot of mana enchanting gear and items you might want to keep when you leave.\n\nIf you find any item that's white, you lose it upon leaving the cave. If you find any item that's yellow, you keep it. You learn a spell that lets you turn items to yellows if you choose, so that's a good way to burn tons of your mana/MP. \n\nAs I said, the game is very simplistic, very click friendly and very automated. I think I saw that this game is or was planned for mobile devices, so if it was, I understand why he made it the way that he did, to keep it simple for those types of platforms.\n\nI just wish it had a bit more involvement. Some input during combat, and in Azure Dreams, any action you take .. be it taking a step, attacking an enemy, or using an item lets every other enemy around you take one step or action too. So it made you consider your moves and decisions like a chess game when you were low on HP but not ready to give up yet. This game could have benefitted alot from that. The enemies are totally stationary and only fight you one on one.\n\nOverall the game is a great little time killer when your attention span is low and you want something just simple to do. I found myself playing it mostly inbetween conversations with friends via instant messages, or other activities that I had to tab back to. This game is a perfect little filler activity.\n\nOh, and the little storyline it has is also very simple but it suits the concept and explains it very well, and gives you an end goal that I personally felt motivated to do. So I'd say the idea he has behind it is fairly solid, just not very deep. But do you really expect it to be?\n\nIf you like the endless dungeon \"genre\", this game is $4.99 and worth the price if you think you'll have fun with it.", "timestamp_created": 1440033579, "timestamp_updated": 1506598158, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17537089": {"recommendationid": "17537089", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002096004", "num_games_owned": 272, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 1100, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1449242232}, "language": "english", "review": "This is the kind of game that I shouldn't like.

Es handelt sich hier um einen klassischen Dungeon Crawler bei dem man Ebene um Ebene von Monstern befreit, neue Ausr\u00fcstung sucht und schlie\u00dflich weiter hinunter in das Verlies steigt. Dazu gibt es noch eine kleine Hintergrundschichte die man Schritt f\u00fcr Schritt entdecken und in der die Geschichte der H\u00f6hle erz\u00e4hlt wird. Jede Ebene wird jedes Mal neu generiert und sieht anders aus. Zudem \u00e4ndert sich mit dem Fortschreiten auch generell das Aussehen der H\u00f6hle und der Gegner was f\u00fcr mehr Abwechslung sorgt. Dabei wird in der Hintergrundgeschichte auch erkl\u00e4rt warum sich das Aussehen jedes Mal \u00e4ndert, das ist toll wenn so etwas auch erkl\u00e4rt wird.\n\nAlles beginnt damit das der Abenteurer in Form der Spielfigur in dem kleinen Dorf vor dem Eingang der H\u00f6hle ankommt. Wie viele andere Abenteurer wurde auch er von der Aussicht auf Sch\u00e4tze und wertvolle Artefakte angelockt. Am Eingang der H\u00f6hle ist auch schon ein Wachposten postiert der allen neuen Abenteurern die Regeln der H\u00f6hle erkl\u00e4rt. Man kann im Dungeon immer tiefer gehen aber nicht wieder nach oben gehen, die einzigste M\u00f6glichkeit wieder das Tageslicht zu sehen besteht darin sogenannte magische Fl\u00fcgel zu finden die einen wieder an die Oberfl\u00e4che teleportieren. Falls man stirbt ist alles verloren was man in diesem Durchgang erreicht hat. Man muss also das Risiko abw\u00e4gen. Zus\u00e4tzlich gibt es alle 10 Ebenen eine Sicherheitsebene bei der sich H\u00e4ndler eingefunden haben bei denen man seine Vorr\u00e4te aufstocken kann.\n\nSo gut wie alles klingt wird der Traum von Ruhm und Reichtum aber schnell zu einem Albtraum. Es verschwinden immer mehr Leute aus der Stadt und die Tagebucheintr\u00e4ge des Erfinders der H\u00f6hle lassen nichts gutes vermuten. Anscheinend haust ganz unten im Verlies eine wirklich schreckliche Bestie die es zu besiegen gilt. \n\nDas Gameplay ist klassisch f\u00fcr einen Dungeon Crawler, man bewegt sich durch die H\u00f6hlen, sammelt Sch\u00e4tze, findet neue Ausr\u00fcstung, sammelt wertvolle Statuskristalle und k\u00e4mpft gegen Monster. Beginnt man einen Kampf gegen ein Monster kann der Kampf nicht mehr abgebrochen werden und wird so lange fortgesetzt bis einer der Kontrahenten tot ist. Man kann nach Beginn eines Kampfes nur noch mit aktiven Zaubern und Heiltr\u00e4nken eingreifen. Vor allem wenn nur noch wenig HP besitzt muss man vorsichtig abw\u00e4gen ob sich der n\u00e4chste Kampf noch lohnt oder ob man zuviel riskiert. Au\u00dferdem gibt es zwei verschiedene Arten von Ausr\u00fcstung, einmal normale Ausr\u00fcstung und einmal legend\u00e4re Ausr\u00fcstung. Sobald man an die Oberfl\u00e4che zur\u00fcckkehrt verschwindet die normale Ausr\u00fcstung, legend\u00e4re Ausr\u00fcstung bleibt aber erhalten und kann auch im \u00f6rtlichen Musem gesammelt werden. Legend\u00e4re Ausr\u00fcstung erh\u00e4lt man zuf\u00e4llig von bestimmten Monstern, aus legend\u00e4ren Ausr\u00fcstungstruhen oder man findet ein Versteck indem sich mehrere legend\u00e4re goldene Truhen befinden. \n\nDie Grafik ist im klassischen 16 Bit Look gehalten und sehen sehr gut aus. Auch die Animationen sind gut umgesetzt und sehen fl\u00fcssig aus. Es gibt aber hin und wieder ein paar kleine Grafikfehler die aber verzeihbar sind. Dabei haben auch viele Monster einzigarte Kampfanimationen, es wurde sich also viel M\u00fche gegeben. Die Musik sticht nicht besonders heraus nervt aber auch nicht. Mein einzigster Kritikpunkt ist Verwaltung der Ausr\u00fcstung, durch die offensichtliche Anpassung an Konsolen l\u00e4sst sich die Ausr\u00fcstung mit der Maus und Tastatur nur umst\u00e4ndlich durchscrollen, man kann nicht einmal das Mausrad benutzen.\n", "timestamp_created": 1439560664, "timestamp_updated": 1439560664, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503722", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17499954": {"recommendationid": "17499954", "author": {"steamid": "76561198195898267", "num_games_owned": 52, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 362, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1440864397}, "language": "english", "review": "Very simple game.

Enemies stay in place, and you can challenge them as you please, though obviously some you NEED to fight in order to get to the next floor. Along the way, you'll earn gold and experience as you gain levels and kill enemies, and you can loot bags/crates/chests for items and equipment along the way, and collect Stat Gems that permanently increase Stats. When it comes to equipment, they come in 2 type: regular and artifact. Normally when you die in the dungeon, you'll lose ALL progress you made on that run. However there's an item called the Escape Wings, which will not only return you to the town, but will let you keep all experience and levels earned, along with all gold and Artifacts and Stat Gems collected. When you escape, all regular items are lost/destroyed, while Artifacts are kept.\n\nWhenever you gain a level, you get to choose 1 stat to permanently increase, and recieve 3 skill points to spend on the Skill Tree. The Skill Tree for the most part are passives, like increased damage, defense, magic, mana, health, etc.. Though there are Spell to get on the Skill Tree that are kept between dungeon runs. Spells like fireball and the like, though there's a few other utility spells, like one that will turn a regular item into an Artifact.\n\nThere are 100 levels in the dungeon, and every 10 levels is a shop to sell your stuff. When you make it to a shop, you'll be able to start your next run on the [i]previous[/i] shop. So, if I made it to the shop on Dungeon Level 20, that means all future runs I have the option of starting on Dungeon Level 10. There's are pluses to starting at the beginning or an earlier level, like having time to collect money and items, which is useful if you're low on gold.\n\nThere's some other side stuff to do, like quests and secret areas that I won't go anymore into. My only real gripe is that you can't rebind keys. It's just a personal preference, but I like to keep my fingers planted on the WASD area, so being able to put the Inventory key on \"F\" instead of \"I\" would be a nice touch. You can also play the game using only the mouse, which works great, though Keyboard works just as nicely.\n\nI definitely recommend this game to anyone who wants a casual roguelike and/or RPG.", "timestamp_created": 1435987950, "timestamp_updated": 1435987950, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506017", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16867359": {"recommendationid": "16867359", "author": {"steamid": "76561198191879027", "num_games_owned": 55, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 136, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1447707437}, "language": "german", "review": "Was soll ich sagen, ich find das Spiel super.

The game is very simple in combat and very rewarding in exploration. Picture the concept of dark souls, where you lose souls every time you die. Well if a certain area in Lordran is tough, you go somewhere else and farm some souls, level up and gain new items and abilities until you are ready for the next area/ boss fight. Well in this game, you run around collecting loot in the various generated dungeon levels. Gold items you keep with you for the rest of the gme while white items dissapear once you leave the cave. The only way to leave the cave, however, is with a certain warping item you pick up. Once you warp out, you are returned to the town and all the gold items you've collected remain with you for the rest of the game but all the white ones will dissapear on return to the hub. If you die in the cave, however, you will lose all gold and white items that you have collected and then you will be transported back to the entrance of the cave. It's a very rewarding system and it made me feel like I progressed through each level of the dungeon and it caused me to actually manage my health and magic and make sure I could take down a certain foe. Whenever I felt a little overwhelmed, I would transport out of the cave (to make sure I kept my gold itmes) then I would re-eneter to go to the mercahnt and upgrade my weapon, buy health and magic potions, some armor and anything else I needed then I would venture back into the cave. If an area was too tough, I would go and revisit certain areas to level up on XP and upgrade weapons. What makes this different from needless grinding of XP through less tough enemies is that the loot respawns. I mentioned Dark Souls earlier and this is where these two mechanics differ drastically. See in dark souls (and other games, I'm not just singling out dark souls (I love the game)) loot doesn't respawn on corpses so it makes revisiting other areas much more of a hastle/ tedious rather than something you think you should do and even want to do. While they share the same risk and reward style, they differ drstically here. Now in this game, there is always the chance of finding an awesome gold weapon hidden in a secret area of the cave or in a chest guarded by some enemy. This the game feel fun and refreshing from a stale ginding mechanic you find in a lot of other games. The music in this game is also fantastic. Grant Kirkhope composed it so obviously its going to be good. I usually hate how the indie game scene sometimes rely heavily on a good musical soundtrack and then the game ends up being subpar, but the game and music are both good! One complaint I do have about the game is that there is sometime a lack of gold itmes. You can't purchase gold itmes from the merchant (at least as far as I've gotten) so you have to rely on purchases of white itmes prior to venturning forth and the itmes you find in the cave. But when you do stumble upon a gold item, it becomes your new baby. The crafting system is also very lack luster. It doesnt have the appeal that many other RPG smilar to this one have. You collect different items in the cave or buy the from the merchant but you don't really get to use them quite often and it makes them seem rather useless sometime, but the core game design is more revolving around exploration. Even though it explorartion heavy, it still doesn't excuse these two flaws to the game. This game has great replay value since it's dungeons are random, something you don't see much of now a days.

In The Enchanted Cave 2 you, an adventurer with your eyes on the prize, enter an enchanted cave and travel through it taking all the loot you can find while taking down or avoiding the many monsters you'll find on your journey in the cave. As you fight monsters and search for loot you'll level up your character, making him more powerful and more able to take on the monsters.\n\nOne thing I'd like to address before I get to my review is that this game, despite being called a rogue-like, is not really a rogue-like. Sure it has procedural level generation but it lacks perma-death, when you die you keep all of your EXP and skills that you've collected.\n\n+Great pixel graphics\n+The cave consists of 100 levels so there's a fair amount to do unless you blaze through all 100 levels in one run\n+Lots of different weapons and items for you to loot along the way\n+Good variety of enemies, new enemies are introduced the further you get in the cave\n+As well as finding loot you also have the ability to create potions and craft your own gear\n+Four playable characters though as far as I can tell the only difference between them is their appearance\n+It's simple and easy to get into, not something that can be said for many games similar to this\n+Great soundtrack which fits well with the game\n\n-While the skill tree is huge it's far too simplistic. The tree itself is split into three sections: warrior skills, mage skills and alchemist skills. Each section of the skill tree then has about four different skills/upgrades which just get repeated over and over again\n-The combat is again, far too simplistic. Unless you try to use the weaknesses of the enemies against them combat consists entirely of walking up to an enemy and watching your character fight it, no input from the player is required\n-The simplicity mentioned above leads to very little replayability in the game unless you're a perfectionist\n\nVerdict:\nWait for a sale (7/10)\n\nThe Enchanted Cave 2 is a good RPG game with rogue-like elements that has great pixel graphics, a large cave to explore and lots of items and enemies that falls somewhat flat due to it's simplicity.\n\n[i]No drama, [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/justreviews]Just Reviews[/url]?[/i]\n\nEl K.", "timestamp_created": 1433884475, "timestamp_updated": 1433884475, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 86, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.770410", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16268685": {"recommendationid": "16268685", "author": {"steamid": "76561198160983297", "num_games_owned": 21, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 510, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1434412726}, "language": "english", "review": "I have been waiting for this game since 1 and when it started coming out for mobile i was getting hype.

The paid version has some nice new content including new side quests, more equipment, more levles, new shop options, and new NPCs. It is well worth the $4.99 price tag. You will find yourself replying and starting over just to try new strategies. For collectors there is even an in game muesum where you can store examples of all the Artefacts you find. Completely your Artefact collection is a nice personal challenge.\n\nSome people might be turned off by the old style graphics, but as a child of the 80s I like the retro look. One other issue that might turn people off are the fact that the monsters don't move around or chase the player, but to offset that monsters often block your path and there are no ranged attacks.

Despite some small annoyances I mentioned earlier the game delivers what it promises, which is a fun game. Of course, it doesn\u2019t actually reach the quality of more complicated games developed by bigger companies, but then again it also doesn\u2019t have the problems those game have, like wide variety of bugs. In fact, I haven\u2019t encountered any bugs so far, which is very good thing. Still, a good game for what it is.\n\nNow, the question whether to go with paid version or free to play version. I honestly see no reason why you shouldn\u2019t buy this. The game is cheap, the paid version actually contains noteworthy improvements like more music and items, and honestly developers like the one who is behind this game actually deserve the support they can get.\n\nSo, do I recommend this game? Absolutely! Especially if you like rogue-lites and dungeon crawlers, and if you are unsure, then you can take a look at the browser version of the game found from Kongregate.\n\nSCORE: 8/10", "timestamp_created": 1433448909, "timestamp_updated": 1433448909, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.424575", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16190146": {"recommendationid": "16190146", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045064926", "num_games_owned": 301, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 623, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1433622481}, "language": "english", "review": "What a great little dungeon explorer!

A skill tree has been added so as you level you can choose what you'd like to focus on. There is also a crafting system where you can make potions and enchant your gear to make them even more useful. Randomly generated floors make it easy to go back and re-explore completed floors without getting boring.

And i must admit i was quite excited when i saw the second one poppin' up on steam.\n\nIf you ever played Lufia 2 - Rise of the Sinistrals on the SNES you should know the Ancient Cave - the optional dungeon of that game. Enchanted Cave follows the same principle. You explore a cave with 99 floors where you will only be able to go further down, not up again. Every floor is filled with monsters and treasure and you must try to find good equipment and fight you way through. If monsters get to strong you can teleport out of the cave with a special item you have to find - but you will lose all equipment you found except for special artifact gear which you are allowed to start with at your next run.\nEvery 10 floors you reach a checkpoint, meaning you can start your next run from there once discovered. Occasionely you will find a shop (usually on said 10th floors) where you can sell your crap and buy useful stuff.\n\nWhat i really enjoy compared to the first game is the implementation of a crafting system. You can't craft your own gear but improve the stuff you found for some extra stats or nice things like life regen.\nI also like the new dungeon layout. The floors are no longer plain squares with walls drawn within them which is nice. There is also some sort of skill tree now which i guess could have been more interesting than it is. The magic path is nice since you learn your spells there now instead of finding them but everything else is just minor stat improvment.\nSome of the villagers will give you quests that so far only consisted of finding specific things in the cave. Not the most interesting thing to do but it's alright for a little extra stuff to do.\n\nSummary:\nSome nice improvements over the first game. If you like rouge-lite dungeon crawling i highly recommend this one to you. The price tag is fair since i think you will at least get 10-12 hours out of it to complete it once and replayability is given for perfectionists.\n", "timestamp_created": 1433364066, "timestamp_updated": 1433364066, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.601521", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16159614": {"recommendationid": "16159614", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057543515", "num_games_owned": 299, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 422, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1433881766}, "language": "english", "review": "Loved the mobile port of this game, and so far the Steam version is even better.

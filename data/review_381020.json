(would be cool if it had it tho). the 16 bit trowback made me feel like a child again playing a SNES Ace Combat game that i never had... and boy... they hit every note right... it is atmospheric of a time where these kind of graphics using the mode 7 Chip were top of the line... is like i am in the 90's again....\n\nthe Gameplay feels like ace combat but is not really exactly like it. it is its own beast... you cant turn very fast at maximum speeds... actually you barely turn at all at that speed, so you need to gauge yourself: do i go fast and get there quick using my missiles, or do i go slower,but have the maneuverability to escape a surprise attack?! the choice is yours and yours alone.\n\nRougelike: This means, Die, and you lose your equipment. Sad... really... but it really pushes you to give your A game on Every mission... you can go to the carrier to rearm and refuel,but once you complete the mission, if you land... the mission is over. so... it is good to leave the objectives to the end if you can help it or the mission does not warrants a failure if you let them go for too long. most of the aircraft including the Workshop ones (Unfortunately not the SU-37 my fighter of choice) has Upgrades to make them even more powerfull... but be carefull... you die, and not only you go in a glorious blaze but your upgrades go as well... so think very carefully when you need to push the eject switch.\n\nHistory: there isn't much on this department... but honestly, i wasn't expecting it from a 16 bit trowback... Starfox for example had barely any aside from the dialouges \"in game wise\"... wich this game unfortunatelly has not... or at least i have to see it yet...\n\nIn Conclusion:\nHistory: not atributed (i won't consider this point. the game has barely any... but at the end of the day,for a game like this one, it makes zero difference in the fun)\nGraphics: 8 (could be better. but you know what... i Love the Direction they've gone here...)\nGameplay:10 (Ace combat with twists... and I LOVE TO DEATH that)\nIn Game Mechanics: 10(seriously... i never thought i would have so much fun with Direct energy weapons... i mean TLSes were good... but dear good the Hunter Direct energy weapon is a BEAST.)\nExtras: Extra 10 (YES ALL MY YES with this gorgeous Workshop.)\n\nFinal Score: [strike]9.9[/strike] 10 (SOOO CLOSE to a 10.... but you know what?! no... i will consider it a 10. this game is a Brilliant Success. yes the price is a bit salty for a indie title with these graphics [R$ 37] but the sheer fun you'll have with it will most than enough make for it. it is worth every penny, and i am very happy with a game like this one).", "timestamp_created": 1505785690, "timestamp_updated": 1508049345, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495926", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35049468": {"recommendationid": "35049468", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049514620", "num_games_owned": 487, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 658, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505812896}, "language": "english", "review": "Unlocked everything within 6 hours, 4 hours later realised the game is unfair in the endgame JUST to prolong playtime.", "timestamp_created": 1505755092, "timestamp_updated": 1505755092, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494641", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34967591": {"recommendationid": "34967591", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008599398", "num_games_owned": 265, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 899, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4, "last_played": 1513206314}, "language": "english", "review": "OH goodnes yes, this game is very addictive and I usually hate rouge lites.\n\nYou cruse around being chill, then have a moment of excitement dodging fire and throwing out salvos of ordanace, and if you did it right you go back to some more chill crusing to plan your next approach and do it all again.\n\nIt's updated regularly even now it's released, has workshop support, and that core gameplay loop is just oddly addicitive.", "timestamp_created": 1505467068, "timestamp_updated": 1505467068, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34943420": {"recommendationid": "34943420", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995259232", "num_games_owned": 2097, "num_reviews": 105, "playtime_forever": 157, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509589051}, "language": "english", "review": "it's ace combat but good.\n\nclean art style, fun and easy to learn progression, and drop-in arcade action. play with a controller; it's worth it.", "timestamp_created": 1505371203, "timestamp_updated": 1505371203, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517887", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34939801": {"recommendationid": "34939801", "author": {"steamid": "76561198150737265", "num_games_owned": 42, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4062, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507296235}, "language": "english", "review": "Having supported the game since the last year (and made numerous amount of mods with it), I'm very disappointed this ended as yet another Early Access failure.

One missile might have a great lock-on range and perform one-hit kills, but be slow to reload. Giving a hit and run approach.

The graphics are simplistic, but good for what they are. Sound quality is similar. Flight is smoth and the different planes actually feel different to fly. \n\nIt is a lot less organized and refined, but the flight characteristics are similar, and if you use a controller, the controls can be easily reconfigured into an Ace Combat-like scheme. \n\nThe game is a lot of fun. It's very good as a casual relaxation game. The missions don't have to take long and it is very easy to jump right in. And another plus point for me, is that the game takes up less than 300MB on my hard drive.\n\nI will give you a word of caution on your initial setup, however. There is a choice between 'Arcade' and 'Simulation' controls. Arcade does not allow for rolling or climbing/diving through a full 360 degrees. If you choose this scheme, you will want to check the box for 'Invert Y Axis'. If you choose Simulation, which I would recommend, you will want to uncheck the 'Invert Y Axis' box. I have no idea why it is set up that way, but it is.\n\nAlso, there are a fair number of mods for this game. Most of them add good quality real-world aircraft to the game. There are also a number of fantasy planes, such as Star Wars fighters, the Longsword from Halo, and most if not all of the super planes from the Ace Combat franchise. My favorite so far is the XFA-27 from Ace Combat 2. \n\nI paid $19 for this game and its soundtrack. In return, I got a good quality flight game that can fill the void left by a recent lack of Ace Combat. This is one the best value-for-money games I've ever bought, and the first one that drove me to write a review on Steam. \nThanks to the developers of this game.

This time it's a retro styled Ace Combat affair. Is it a Kenny Loggins success or just a bit bobbins?\n\nHow time flies. I can\u2019t believe it's been 3 years since I initially backed the alpha of Sky Rogue on itch.io. I\u2019d completely forgot about the title up until I received an update informing me that the game was finally out of early access and that the 1.0 point release was on Steam\u2019s digital store\n\nI was originally drawn to the game because I\u2019m a sucker for simple filled polygons. This love of primitive shapes goes back to Starglider 2 on the Atari ST. A groundbreaking title, which was in its day, the pinnacle of 3D graphics. Time marches on and so does technology. What was once considered cutting edge is now just a twee retro aesthetic. I have no problem with that and activity seek out anything that employs this classic look.\n\nI love a good dog fight, whether it's a Tie fighter, Sopwith Camel or a Eurofighter. There\u2019s nothing quite like a high-speed joust between your foe in the open sky or vacuum of space. Getting on your opponents six and nailing them with whatever armaments your craft is equipped with is deeply satisfying. A personal favourite of mine is the lock on missile sound. It's a great audible cue that your enemies days are numbered. Flying through the debris of their shattered craft adds to the intoxicating gameplay mix.\n\nThe campaign mode is the meat of the game. This is where the rogue part of the game's title comes from. Set over 12 days, you are tasked with completing one mission per day. These are randomly generated. A sortie can include taking out out airborne targets such as lone AWACS planes, bomber squadrons or drones. Land based objective include sam sites, factories and command centres. There\u2019s also the addition of naval encounters which can comprise of freighters and cruisers. As the campaign progressed the missions ramps up in difficulty. The opening couple of days are a cakewalk, taking out lone undefended Awacs is a turkey shoot. By day 4 it's a whole different ballgame. Blitzing a well-defended command centre surrounded by SAM sites is a tricky proposition, early warning radar scrambles drone and veteran units to fill the skies with a hornet's nest of feisty foes.\n\nAs you complete missions you receive Tech points(XP) and cash. The cash can be used to upgrade your arsenal items during missions. When you inevitably die, you get to spend your tech points based on your performance. If you level up, you'll get to pick a weapon/item/plane. Sometimes if you have done particularly well you get two choices. Then you start the whole shebang again, only now you have a bigger and more robust arsenal to tailor your mission load-outs.\n\nThe real star of the show is the ordinance that you can equip your aeros with. You start out with a rather humdrum arsenal but death by death you acquire some very nice kit. There\u2019s all manner of guns, missiles and even drones to add to your loadout. I particularly like the long range AA missiles like the AAM-LR Longbow and AAM-MR Javelin. These long reach weapons allow your slower fighter-bombers to rule the sky from afar, way before any more agile foes can get in range and cause you harm. These are pure hog heaven and inject a sense of technical superiority as you press a button unleashing certain death upon your unwitting target. There\u2019s an innate beauty watching a longbow missile arc across the azure sky, leaving a wispy vapour trail before blowing your enemy back into the dark ages.\n\nIn addition to the campaign, there are two more modes. Endless; this is the same as the main missions but without any end bosses and obviously goes on Infinitum. Free flight is the opening level devoid of any foes, allowing you to practise flying manoeuvres and try out different control schemes.\n\nThe soundtrack that accompanies all this air carnage is an amalgam of 16-bit cracktro styled tracks along with bombastic Advance Wars flavoured menu(GBA) tunage. They align beautifully with the prevailing retro aesthetic. Lots of pitch bending top lines, crest atop of pulsating FM bass lines and crunchy drum beats. Spot Fx for lock ons are on point and deliver a great audible 8bit beep feedback. Every weapon select is accompanied by suitable bleeps and bloops.\n\nGraphics are pure Atari ST / Amiga era nostalgia. If you have ever played Carrier Command or Starglider then these will evoke days of yore. Clean immaculate low poly models zip through the skies in a vibrant retina burning basic colour world. Sonic blue is abound both in the liveries of the areos and the surrounding vista. Explosions are Heinz ketchup red and Coleman's mustard yellow. There\u2019s no gritty COD browns or muted colours employed here. Everything has been painted with the primary palette of a Saturday morning cartoon. Bliss.\n\nSky rogue has come along way since its early alpha. I\u2019m happy to report that all the issues I had with the control schemes have been ironed out. Gamepad support is tight and responsive. Using the Unity plugin rewire gives the player all the custom options to tweak the controls and button bindings for every function. There are more QOL features in the options menu. You have the choice of playing in arcade mode which doesn\u2019t flip the entire screen when you pull off a barrel roll. Only the model spins. I call this feature the anti chunder/puke mode, for folks who suffer from motion sickness. Another option stops missiles from firing until you have a good lock on your targets. All these features are welcome and aid to a cool gameplay experience.\n\nSky rogue is a classic arcade shooter loving wrapped in a retro low poly aesthetic, folks who desire a quick dogfight with out all the usual time-consuming flight simulation baggage will find a lot of enjoyment from this tightly coded package. So play out your Iceman fantasies and jump into the danger zone!\n\nFor a full review with screenshots, Youtube gameplay and PC options tour videos, click on the link below.\n\n[url=https://hardlockup.wordpress.com/2017/08/27/sky-rogue-review/] Hardlockup Blog [/url]\n", "timestamp_created": 1503847312, "timestamp_updated": 1503847312, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.529366", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34527371": {"recommendationid": "34527371", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998159285", "num_games_owned": 450, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 187, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503831608}, "language": "english", "review": "(TL;DR at bottom)\n\nSky Rogue is one of those games that you wanted so bad when you were a child. Now that you've grown up, you realize that lot of potential was missed even from its debut date.\n\nThe main problem with Sky Rogue is that it has nothing to offer, or at least it fails to give you new things. Back in Early Access, I questioned how the game would evolve. From shoot planes ask questions later to a 1.0 release, it surely will have a story, maybe new amazing features that make this game unique, or just something that gives it a reason to play this game now. That was thrown out the window when beta hit, all you get is a single player that has no story what-so-ever and some split-screen. (No MP because developer couldn't figure it out) Oh, and here's a boss I guess? \n\nSky Rogue feels like it was a test engine, and nothing more. I feel like the developer ran out of ideas, and just gave up in the end of alpha. Beta was probably one of the worst segments of this game, there was only THREE versions. All were some patch fixes and balancing AI + weapons. When the reveal came about the \"secret\" (Boss Fight). I died, I hella died inside. I was riding a train that never existed, a hype that was evolved in pure imagination. I don't blame the dev, but at least could've done more than just a generated playground with ships and a BLOODY BOSS FIGHT!\n\nI know that I repeated the same stuff in a more exagerrated way, but that's how much content there is! Upgrade system? Sure, every game has those these days. Grinding? It exists, and its not very rewarding... just upgrade the rockets and be done with it! Modding? Its just a ship model, the smaller the ship / the better it is to win. There's really no reason to play this game, no story, no cool places, everything is a color swap and terrain alteration.\n\nThere's nothing that makes Sky Rogue appealing but the artstyle. Its fun? Sure, for about ten minutes... then it gets old and becomes forgettable. But even the SUPERHOT tech demo gives way more bang for your buck. (its free and has an interesting premise) Overall, just a dissapointment.\n\n\n\nTL;DR\n\nBuy this game on a sale if you want a time waster, don't expect a whole lot of stuff after that. Its a come and go type of game. No story, no online, simple modding, useless upgrade system, and extremely buggy. Just shoot ships, nothing else.

Feels just like it, but has a few changes from the classic formula.  Instead of any RTB, you have recharging weapons.  Additionally, it is a rogue-like that you can unlock new planes/weapons by killing enough stuff to keep on subsequent playthroughs.  Also, between missions you can upgrade your weapons with cash earned (separate currency from unlock currency).\n\nI like it a lot, but my only gripe is that it quickly lacks variety.  Due to the procedurally-generated missions, nothihng stands out.  Every mission is basically the same with a different plane/building as the primary target.  \n\nThe graphics are clean and nice, but I wish that we could have some incremental improvements.  Weather effects would be nice, some textured planes/ground/etc.\n\nIf we could ever get a distinctly designed campaign, I'd be in love.  Something like classic Ace Combat missions: a trench run, a d-day bombing mission to help landing troops, somethhhing like a time-attack mission to kill X enemies before a time limit, a chase-down mission to try and catch up with a bomber, dynamic missions where new enemies come in or targets change, etc.\n\nThis is a fantastic start, and it brings me back to the PS2 Ace Combat days wonderfully.  \n", "timestamp_created": 1503810549, "timestamp_updated": 1503810549, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.643532", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34519791": {"recommendationid": "34519791", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063542647", "num_games_owned": 198, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 1047, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504583184}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a semi-Rouge like dog fighting arcade game with Star fox graphics...

There's a weird conflict between arcade-y mechanics and realistic-ish mechanics (like stalls) that makes the game feel conflicted.\n\nRetro-style graphics are great but there's almost no variety - jets are varied, but you engage at ranges where you can't really see details. Random island shapes are cool...but there are no textures or features, so it's just randomly shaped monochrome blobs sparsely dotted with random buildings.\n\nLots of weapons...but most of the time you're going to rely on your main missiles. No matter what weapons you choose, expect to spend some time waiting for reloads. Weapon balance feels all over the place, and since you only unlock new tech after you die, you tend to cap out one loadout and then get a little bored.\n\nCombat feels extremely slow - even the fighter/interceptor jets turn sluggishly - and jets can't loop (maximum of straight up or straight down) with arcade controls enabled. Enemy combat AI is all over the place - most of the time my bomber was completely ignored, occasionally I'd get spammed with missiles. Carriers and ships either have really terrible defenses, really terrible aim, or...not the greatest AI.\n\nSome missiles do almost no damage; some chunk a third of your health. This makes playing the slower jets obnoxious - you're supposed to be able to take some hits but you can never really know how many.\n\nThere are some bugs and gaps that just aren't acceptable in a released game - if you have arcade controls turned on (which you're prompted to choose when you start the first time) you can't clear the tutorial with a controller since you can't roll your ship. \"Invert Y\" has different meanings for arcade and traditional - it inverts what the developer chose for those modes, as opposed to the usual meaning. Your mission objective is identified by name, and it's not always clear whether it's an air or ground target, so you might end up with no real firepower to finish the mission - the built-in encyclopedia doesn't cover most of the names and didn't appear to update as I finished runs. In-air collisions sometimes do damage and sometimes don't - having two jets bouncing in to each other repeatedly with no damage isn't really fun or immersive. Speaking of collisions, any scrapes with certain objects (ground, buildings, the carriers) instantly destroys your jet.\n\nI might revisit Sky Rogue in the future but I can't recommend it as-is.", "timestamp_created": 1503768285, "timestamp_updated": 1503768375, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.645171", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34508864": {"recommendationid": "34508864", "author": {"steamid": "76561198279725990", "num_games_owned": 35, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 117, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503765051}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u867d\u7136\u662f\u597d\u8bc4\u63a8\u8350\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u76ee\u524d\u8fd8\u3010\u4e0d\u63a8\u8350\u3011\u8d2d\u4e70\n//\n\u6e38\u620f\u4e0d\u9519\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u5904\u4e8e1.0\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u76ee\u524dbug\u4e5f\u4e0d\u5c11\uff0c\u5404\u79cd\u95ea\u9000\uff0c\u521b\u610f\u5de5\u574a\u7684\u98de\u673a\u6709\u4e9b\u673a\u80fd\u5f88bug\uff0c\u901f\u5ea6\u673a\u52a8\u52a0\u901f\u5ea6\u5404\u79cd\u7206\u8868\u7b80\u76f4\u4f5c\u5f0a\uff0c\u8fd9\u6e38\u620f\u8981\u7528\u624b\u67c4\u73a9\uff0c\u9f20\u6807\u64cd\u7eb5\u5f88\u8ff7\uff0c\u7ecf\u5e38\u4f1a\u4e0d\u77e5\u4e0d\u89c9\u6253\u5708\u5708\uff0c\u6e38\u620f\u91cc\u7684\u5bfc\u5f39\u4e5f\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5584\uff0c\u660e\u660e\u662f\u5bf9\u5168\u4f53\u7684\u7a7a\u5bf9\u7a7a\u5bfc\u5f39\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u4e00\u53d1\u51fa\u53bb6\u4e2a\uff0c6\u4e2a\u90fd\u662f\u6253\u540c\u4e00\u4e2a\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u6ca1\u6cd5\u81ea\u52a8\u9501\u5b9a\u591a\u4e2a\u76ee\u6807\u3002\u8fd9\u6837\u5bf9\u5168\u4f53\u5c31\u5931\u53bb\u610f\u4e49\u4e86\u3002\u901f\u5ea6\u5c3a\u548c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5c3a\u6ca1\u6709\u5177\u4f53\u6570\u503c\u5f88\u8ff7\uff0c\u90fd\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u4ec0\u4e48\u65f6\u5019\u78b0\u5230\u5730\u9762\uff0c\u4ec0\u4e48\u65f6\u5019\u4f1a\u5931\u901f\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4f53\u79ef\u5927\u7684\u98de\u884c\u5668\uff08\u6ca1\u9519\uff0c\u98de\u884c\u5668\uff0c\u4e0d\u662f\u98de\u673a\uff0c\u6211\u53d1\u73b0\u521b\u610f\u5de5\u574a\u6709\u732a\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u7b80\u76f4\u4e27\u75c5\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u53ea\u80fd\u770b\u5230\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u770b\u4e0d\u5230\u5168\u8eab\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u5728\u8fdb\u884c\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e00\u51cf\u901f\u6a21\u578b\u5c31\u4f1a\u76d6\u4f4f\u6574\u4e2a\u5c4f\u5e55\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1503764908, "timestamp_updated": 1503764908, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34506651": {"recommendationid": "34506651", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025358250", "num_games_owned": 502, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 67, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504135570}, "language": "english", "review": "I am currently playing through the game.

I was hoping that the issues I was having would get fixed up but now that it's been released I am giving up on that ever happening.\n\n\tThe game isn't terrible by any stretch of the imagination, I wouldn't have played 45hrs of it if it was. Rather it has some fundamental design features which mean its just not that fun. This game is a great example of a sound game (a few bugs here and there but nothing game breaking) that falls flat because design choices which encourage unfun play.\n\nMy problems with the game fall broadly into 2 camps: The physics and the content(planes, weapons, enemies, etc.)\n1. Physics:\n\tThe problem here is that this game advertises itself as \"a fwooshy rogue-lite action flight simulator\". However the planes handle like thrust-vectoring, V8 powered biplanes in low gravity. Low top-speed, Low max altitude, low manuverablility at speed but insane low speed manoeuvring, insane power to weight ratio and insanely low stall speed.\n\tAll but the heaviest planes can accelerate vertically, go from min speed to max speed in seconds, pull out of a stall with no problem, and pull a turn on a dime. It is my suspicion that there is almost no effect from air speed on pitch, yaw and roll rates (if anything it slows them down), this means that a plane can pull incredibly tight turns at very low speeds, but at top speeds (which aren\u2019t very high), you end up controlling a freight train.\n\tAll this results in a flight sim that doesn't feel \"fwooshy\" at all. I want to avoid bringing real planes into this as this isn't mean to be realistic and I am fine with that. However I feel that it should be mentioned that real planes manoeuvre (mostly) with flaps which have an effect proportional to air speed, higher speeds should me the planes roll faster however in game they roll like an A380 (even the fighters). I feel like, for this game to deliver on \"fwooshy\", you want planes that are fast, manoeuvrable but only at higher speeds and which can't decelerate to stall speed in no time at all. Under these circumstances, flying would be a joy, but that is not what you get in this game. In the end all dogfighting results in you spinning on the spot at minimum speed to line up a shot one the enemy (thing banshee duels in halo 1), which really isn\u2019t fun.\n\tIn all fairness there are a few planes which are faster and more manoverable and so almost approach \"fwooshy\" when flown in a certain way but that just brings me to the other set of issues.\n\nTLDR: The flight physics are bad and the planes feel weird and slow, not \"fwooshy\". Also the dogfighting sucks, in an air combat game.\n\n\n2. The content:\n\tThis game has 9 planes of various roles, a bunch of weapons ranging from semi-active guided terminal homing long ranged air-to-air missiles, to cluster bombs, to rockets, to Gatling guns which play in a variety of different and interesting ways and which are good in a variety of situations against various targets. You use this to take on a range of targets such as enemy fighters, carriers, buildings, bombers, and ships. All on randomly generated islands which consist of 3 different biomes, each with its own topography.\n\tSounds good right? Lots of variety to keep things interesting. Well, not really.\nIn this game, you aim is to take out the objective on a bunch of islands which consist of buildings, groups of planes flying on pre-set paths and the odd boat. They tell you what the objective is before you start the island however once you have launched you can't change your plane.\n\tNow, to get through the game you need to upgrade your weapons and plane, this takes money. This requires you to destroy buildings, especially on the early levels when there aren\u2019t too many threats. However, buildings have high health so you need a high damage weapon to take them out in a decent timeframe, but the more powerful weapons are heavier and so can't be carried by the lighter, faster, \"fwooshy\"er planes. You could chip away with smaller weapons if you are patient but the carrier and aerodrome will be launching planes as you attack them so you really want to finish them quickly. So this encourages you to use heavier planes (bombers and heavy multi-role) which are slower and less fun to fly. However you cant change planes mid mission so you also need to dogfight in said plane, this means you need aa weapons and some manuverablility. This encourages you to use lighter planes (fighters, interceptors and multi-role) which have the avionics to equip good aa missiles.\n\tAll this leaves you in the position of having to use a heavy, multi-role plane to carry bombs and missiles. There is only really one plane that fits the bill. So even though there are 9 planes in the game I found myself only ever using 3 of them tops, and mostly using one.\nLike wise, the only weapons that is good at taking out buildings and light ground targets is a single type of bomb, and to take out carriers there are only a few weapons with the damage. This means that out of all the weapons you will probably only really use a handful. Online multiplayer could help with this by letting each player specialise, but this game doesn't have that.\n\nTLDR: The design choice around the content in the game mean that most of the options at your disposal are sub-optimal. You are forced to create an all round loadout to take out buildings and fighters and only a few things fit the bill. So, there is actually a lot less variety in this game than you think.\n\nThis all results in a game that is just not worth your time/money. This game could be great, and I had sky high hopes for it, online multiplayer, maybe a 5v5 pvp where you are trying to take out your opponents carrier, a better flight model with faster planes and larger maps, weapons to fill the gaps in the current arsenal to create more interesting choices, the ability to switch planes mid mission to allow for specialisation, better enemy ai, more interesting mechanics around bombing.  Alas, it is not to be.\n", "timestamp_created": 1503623384, "timestamp_updated": 1503623384, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 66, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.655616", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34469982": {"recommendationid": "34469982", "author": {"steamid": "76561198089623176", "num_games_owned": 188, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 36, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1445478243}, "language": "english", "review": "Got this game before it was ever put on steam.

This is one of the few flight sim games I have on steam (if not the only) and is one of the few Early Access titles I've been a vague part of. For the 25% discount (15 USD) I'd say it's one of the best flight games for its price. It is no where near a perfect game, but there have been many improvements within its development cycle and I'd be willing to call it \"complete\" if it has a few more tweaks applied to it following this release.\n\nSky Rogue is a roguelike flying game where you take on increasingly numerous and difficult enemies. Its missions are randomly generated in 12 days on the singleplayer campaign or as many as you can beat in the Endless mode. Also supports workshop for custom aeros and custom missions. It's built in Unity which is a big detractor to many (myself included) however this is better than most of the unity \"games\" you'd see on the Steam Store of 2017.\n\nPROS:\n-Plenty of aeros and weapons to research, with the best ones being available after you beat the campaign\n-Varied enemy types in the air, land and sea with most aeros having a veteran or ace variant with better AI and weapons\n-Fast transition between menus and load times are almost nil\n-Does its best to offer as much replayability as possible; every loadout is viable\n-Artstyle is simple, however it is also detailed and most objects have a distinct look that can be easily recognized from a distance\n-Light on resources; almost any computer can run this game\n-Decent OST but may get repetitive\n\nMEH/CONS:\n-No online Co-Op. Big fat CON right there.\n-Menus are simplistic and the controls menu is still defualt unity assets. Video quality is either \"yes\" or \"no\" and sound levels still change even if you have the volume sliders where you want them\n-There is no tutorial, so new users will either have to look at stock unity menus or experiment in free flight to figure out how to play. Most features and game mechanics are something new players would have to stumble upon rather than learn in a concise manner\n-While the models and landscape have improved since the game's debut, the artstyle itself has stayed mostly the same and may wear on you over long periods of time\n-On controllers you may have to wrestle with the camera a bit if you go beyond a certain point when rotating it.

As you progress you earn exp which can be used to unlock certain items at your level to help you progress further and further on to the end boss, pretty simple right, well yeah, if you survive. The game features a perma death system, if you die, you have to start the campaign mode all over from the start, atleast you keep your unlocks\n\nPros: Features workshop support with some very well crafted planes, skins, missions and ect. Different planes and weapon systems offers hours of replayable content, finishing missions in different ways and feeling more like a badass while doing it, randomly generated terreign adds to that\n\nCons: Perma death system feels like it was added in to add abit of a longer lifespan to the game, its more frustrating than a game extender for me. Certain workshop mods just break the game, some being completely overpowered and offering no challenge at all (Developer has no controll over this). It missed a big marker for a good coop/pvp section for this game, yeah it offers split screen.... I guess, but the lack any online coop/multiplayer really bring this game down a good peg or 2\n\nOverall, is this game worth trying/buying?\nyeah, its a arcade like air combat game with a low poly art style that not only looks pretty cool, its able to run on lower preforming systems, so yeah.

This marks my second (and perhaps last) purchase during the 2017 summer sale, and I must say it was a good decision, indeed, especially for an Early Access title.\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\nSky Rogue hardly stands up to recent Ace Combat titles (or similar) in terms of detail, but this game isn't trying to - it has a charming, simple, yet consistent art-style that is easy on the eyes, and it contains plenty of varied, unique designs for aircraft to go along with that style. The heads-up display is easily readable, and the UI is also simple and easy to use. Unlike some titles, I won't be able to ramble on here about graphics artifacts or the rendering of bees flying between the blades of grass, but this game nonetheless more than 'does the job' visually.\n\n[h1]Audio[/h1]\nSky Rogue comes with an array of unique retro-style sounds for its weapons, aircraft, and UI, and all more than do the job - weapons, in particular, sound distinct from one another and memorable, especially the long-range air-to-air missiles. The soundtrack is quite fine, though it can become slightly repetitive as each particular 'zone' in the single-player mode uses one track at the time of this review. While you might opt to turn down the in-game music and start playing [url=https://youtu.be/9G1ob5jnuSo]Comona[/url] instead, the game's own music is quite alright by my book.\n\n[h1]Performance[/h1]\nWhile I have yet to test it on a laptop, it performs perfectly on my desktop, as one would hope. I have also yet to encounter any bugs that impede progress in any way, leaving me quite impressed with this Early Access title. In fact, the only bug I have encountered was when a ship decided to sail through the land - hardly game-breaking, but... [i]interesting[/i] to say the least. Based on other reviews, however, I have no reason to doubt the performance on less-than-stellar machines.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nAs a fan of the classic Ace Combat formula, I found all that (and a little more) here in Sky Rogue. The basic premise is simple: Choose an aircraft (or, as the game calls them, an aero), pick out up to four weapons and a piece of specialized equipment to load on-board, then launch off the deck of your floating carrier-blimp to complete your objectives. Weapons come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and for different purposes; various types of guns, air-to-air infrared, radar-guided, and dumb-fire missiles and rockets, plus bombs, and some unique pieces of kit to replace the ordinary flares ensures the game not only has plenty of replayability, but also supports various flying styles to complete your mission. My only real complaint in regard to the gameplay overall would have to be the lack of proper dogfight AI as of the time of this review. Enemy aeros will happily chase after you and fire off a missile or two, but will then veer off in another direction before coming around again - I haven't been in any tight turning fights yet, something I hope to see in later versions of Sky Rogue.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=961806394\n\n[h1]Singleplayer[/h1]\nMost of the time you'll spend in Sky Rogue will be in singleplayer, either in the dynamic campaign, endless mode, or custom scenarios. The campaign starts off simple and ramps up in difficulty the more missions you complete, and as the name suggests, your progress will be reset if you crash. Fear not, however, as any unlocked weapons and aeros will stay; only upgrades and campaign progress are lost - though this is for the best, as the upgrades do significantly empower your aero and its weapons, and would make the early stages a bit too easy. I have to say, though, that there is plenty of replayability in the singleplayer alone, and it is, no doubt, enough of a draw to bring in most fans of arcade air combat.\n\n[h1]Multiplayer[/h1]\nAs of the time of this review, multiplayer comes in the form of a local split-screen cooperative campaign mode, with two 'aeronauts' for the price of one Sky Rogue. It's just as fun as single-player (if not more so thanks to the addition of a comrade to help you down your foes), though I do hope to see proper online multiplayer in the future, as well as perhaps an adversarial dogfighting mode in addition to cooperative play.\n\n[h1]Community Content[/h1]\nSky Rogue does come with Steam Workshop integration, and much to my adoration the first mod to appear on the Workshop was the ADFX-01 Morgan:  [url=https://youtu.be/80XAJKqRU9k][b]<<[/b] Here comes the snow! [b]>>[/b][/url]  A host of other mods, including new aeros and missions, have already been released, though one might want to keep in mind the less consistent visual style with community-created aeros. Still, having reached this point, I can say Sky Rogue has checked all the boxes I hoped it would.\n\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\nFor any would-be Aces in search of a respite from that insatiable excitement for Ace Combat 7, Sky Rogue may prove to be just the game for you. Indeed, I can see myself still playing it long after Project Aces' newest title finally releases, as it is just that fun and dynamic - and, of course, just different enough - compared to replaying older Ace Combat titles again and again to earn a spot on my favorites list. Forkbeard, you've done something not many others could, and I commend you for it, and hope to see it grow further as time goes by.\n\n[b]I recommend Sky Rogue.[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1498765962, "timestamp_updated": 1498974871, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 34, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.808074", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "32973434": {"recommendationid": "32973434", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057569693", "num_games_owned": 308, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 356, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499069323}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a fun little game.

The graphics are good and the world creation is satisfying in a minecraft sort of way.  All in all this is game has the possibility of being a 10/10 when it comes out of beta.  \n\nSome fo what I would like to see:  improved mission briefing system (a must!!!) - the current mission briefing is overly simplistic.  With that said though, don't make me watch a stupid cinematic event with woo woo music and lame acting.  But something better then shoot down bomber.

The selection of aircraft is quite varied and overall fairly balanced, and the same can be said for the weapon selection. The workshop is crammed full of custom levels and aeros, which I believe will continue to make this game worth coming back to for years to come. If you want a fun, challenging flying game, this is worth looking into.\n\nThe single player 'campaign' spans a 13 day/level offensive on a bunch of randomly generated islands out at sea. Each day sees the player given a random key target or several to eliminate. Once the mission is complete, the player then has to return to base alive - or can hang around and bomb more ground targets or shoot down waves of aircraft. The longer the mission goes on for, and the more damage the player causes, the harder it gets.\n\nYou earn cash/credits for every kill, with the reward set proportionally to how valuable the target was. This cash can be used to either purchase upgrades for unlocked weapons and aeros, or be able to make mid-mission landings to repair and rearm. If you get seriously battered in combat, you might want to run home and pay the repair bill, because if you get shot down, you start over from the beginning with no upgrades and no cash.\n\nDying isn't a wholly bad thing, however. In fact, death is the only way to unlock and obtain new weapons and aeros. So though death may set you back to the beginning, you may now find yourself having access to better equipment, too.\n\nOverall, the game is very addicting.

It boasts single and local cooperative play, numerous playable planes, upgradable weapons, enemies, targets, and proceedurally-generated maps.\n\nMinus a few technnical flaws (as of Beta 2) it functions well and as expected. Flying is fluid and so much fun once you learn to stop crashing into the water. Combat is satisfying, exhilarating and fast-paced. The menus are functional, but need a little polish. All in all, I love it.\n\nSome features I would like to see:\n- I'd like to have it when I select one of my equipped weapons in the loadout menu, the menu would jump to my current weapon and show its stats rather than the last one highlighted. It makes it a little difficult to compare weapons as it currently is.\n- Since this is an arcade style game, I'd like to have a timer on missions. Completing the objective and turning in earlier would yield additional rewards. This would make the mission objective a priority, rather than clearing everything in each stage to get the most money for upgrades. Total anihilation is fun, but I tend to pick one plane with one loadout every time, instead of upgrading planes for different purposes - making combat a little repetitive.

The game looks and sound great, I particularly love how the sky is visualized in this game. The designs are great, i'm a sucker for low poly, retro and minimalism and this game really satisfies all of those wants for me. The controls took a while to get used to. I've got a keyboard and number pad, so i'm not able to get any sensitivity in my roll, which to me is the biggest downside of not having a controller. Once i got deep into rebinding the controls i was able to dial a setup that i like quite a bit right now.\n\n\nOnce i became adjusted to the controls and felt a little more confident, i realized just how much FUN this game is! I feel like I have been waiting for this game for a long time.  The way certain the rockets deploy and smash your target is so satisfying, and there are so many different missiles that all seem to have a real functional and balanced value. I've not unlocked all the guns yet, but the ones i do have feel fantastic and once again INCREDIBLY SATISFYING to kill targets with. I have never felt more like an airborne badass than while playing this game. \n\n\nThe physics really take this game to another level for me. My craft always feels really heavy, and i'm having such a great time pulling all the way back on the throttle, and using the gravity to pull myself around a corner. It's hard to explain, but i feel like a viper pilot in the BSG reboot, and i've not really played a game that's been able to capture just how much i have wanted to do that. It feel like 45% BSG, 35% realistic sim, 20% Star Wars. I don't know, i'm really going out far for this interview because i'm so passionate about this game.\n\n\nI love the fact that i lose all my money and upgrades upon death, it really makes this game feel like a great arcade game that i can play over and over again. If there is one thing i could ask the developers, it would be to implement a handbrake command. I would love the ability to just kill my engines, free fall and flip through for a second and gun the engines so i can be right over where i would want to be on the target. This would push the game to stratospheric levels of entertainment for me, and i imagine it would put a considerable impact on the total amount of sun on my body over the course of my human life.\n\n\nI really do feel like i have been waiting for this game for years, and i'm so happy i spent the money to buy it, and i'm THRILLED to see what's to come.

As a fan of arcade style games, especially ones that hearken back to the 80s and 90s, this one does just that, and flawlessly!!!\n\nArming my unlocked fighters with unlocked weapons and special abilities, trying things out and seeing what my favorites are, keeps me entertained and on my toes. I especially love mixing and matching various fighters and weapons too, like putting bomber weapons on an interceptor, and interceptor weapons on a bomber...! (although you have to mitigate the weapon amount to make a few of these possible...) The possibilities can get quite frantic, just about as frantic as the missions are themselves!\n\nSpeaking of missions, the missions in Sky Rogue always give me something to look forward to as well. No matter how many times I play the same three missions over and over again, trying to better my score while staying alive (because if you die, you have to start from the beginning) never gets boring, thanks to the procedurally generated landscapes and enemy placements. I can never expect to find the same set of factories, satelites, command towers and surface defense guns to be in the exact same place all the time, and that keeps things fresh. Not to mention, the missions are always straightforward as well. No special requirements or objectives, and no limitations of fighters or weapons. Pick a fighter, arm it, and go take out the mission targets. That's it! Nothing fancy! Just get out there and take 'em down!\nOne thing I did not expect is that after I destroy the last mission target and complete the mission, the mission doesn't necessarily have to be \"over\". If I want to, I can still take down the swarms of drones and fighters that have been pestering me throughout my struggle to take down the mission targets, or clear the rest of the island of its ground and sea targets.\n\nAnother thing I didn't expect from Sky Rogue is the absence of a story, or at least some form of story-centered series of objectives within each consecutive mission. However, because of how much fun I was having taking down targets within each mission, I didn't really see a need for one. And honestly, that's the best part. Because the way I see it, just as I do with any other story-lacking game (i.e. Terraria), it provides room for the player to make up their own story from their imagination. And I truly believe, beyond the shadow of a doubt, that the same can be said for Sky Rogue as well.\n\nWhat really caught me by surprise about Sky Rogue was that it also has a Workshop page. Little did I imagine that people in the community of this game would be making their own custom fighters to share with others! And even though I have not yet downloaded any fighter models from the Workshop, I still think it's worh it to check it out, by all means.\n\nOf course, I can't finish this review without talking about the graphics in Sky Rogue, and boy do they fit the gameplay style very well...! The graphics are very reminiscent to what a handful of arcades had back in the early 90s, games like Air Combat, After Burner, F-14 G-Loc, or Solvalou. While polygonal shapes and seemingly solid-colored textures can be unappealing by today's high definition/high resolution standards, Sky Rogue adorns this kind of aesthetic beautifully, and in a way that make the objects easy to discern from one another, and the game generally easy to look at.\n\nOverall, this game, at only 4.2 hours on record as of this review, has me hooked. I think it's safe to say that Sky Rogue is the kind of Top Gun/Ace Combat flight sim arcade game that I've been hoping for. Because I never truly got a chance to play games of this style at my local arcades when I was younger, it always makes me ask myself: \"Is this what it was like to play a game like this back in the day???\"\n\nSo before I take off from the carrier to destroy some more drones and command towers, I'll part by saying, that this game is worth its price of $9.99, without a doubt!\n\n*Fighter screams off into the distance.*\n\n\nEDIT: I just found out about camera view changes, which include third person, first person, and cinematic mode. And while the camera in first person seems to slightly glitch through some of the fighters' models, it's nothing to be overly concerned about, and doesn't look like something that can't be changed as the game updates with time.\n\nEDIT: Sky Rogue also detects and supports a wide variety of controllers, and especially flight sticks. However, here's a fair warning...\n\nOnce you go flight stick... you'll never go back...!!! (although I guess this is true for many other flight sim games)\n\nAfter successfully being able to connect both my Logitech Extreme 3D Pro Flight Stick AND my new Thrustmaster T-Flight HOTAS 4 Flight Stick and Throttle, I have to admit it changes the game play and controls for the better, and I haven't brought myself to play it with a mouse and keyboard ever since...! So if you have a controller or flight stick of any sort, I suggest using them with Sky Rogue; you won't regret it...!", "timestamp_created": 1490071185, "timestamp_updated": 1494611059, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30614380": {"recommendationid": "30614380", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079744926", "num_games_owned": 167, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 3505, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508379762}, "language": "english", "review": "I joined the Aeroforce when I was 18.

My home, my family... Gone. From that day forward, I was out for blood. I was given a Rogue, and I made my first kill soon after.\n\n\"You're ready for take-off, Ace. Remember, you represent the last hope for peace.\"\n\n------------------------\n\nSky Rogue is one of those few games that is a mis-mash of a couple different genres that actually works. What do I mean? Well, it's an arcade-flight sim similar to games like Ace Combat and Crimson Skies, with many many planes and a lot of action. It has a fairly unique randomly generated system where the various islands and missions are completely randomized. While this normally is a good thing, randomly-generated missions does have its drawbacks, meaning that you could either have a mission where you have to shoot down multiple Kondor bombers, followed by a mission where you have to destroy a flying corvette (not the car, but the ship), followed by a mission where you have to shoot down a Gryphon AWACS plane, etc etc. OOOOOOR, you can have multiple missions in a row dedicated to destroying command buildings or X-Labs. Which, that can just get boring after a while. However, that doesn't detract from the overall experience of playing Sky Rogue. It is a game DESIGNED to be quick to pick up, but difficult to master. And if you've ever played either Ace Combat or Crimson Skies, you should be right at home with this game. The art style is fairly unique, with bright, colorful aircraft signifying the enemy, and a slew of different paint schemes for your entire fleet of planes. Oh, and you get MANY planes. From fighters, interceptors and even HEAVY BOMBERS. I would love to see this game evolve over time, maybe with more useable aircraft added, and an actual plot. Speaking of, what IS the plot of Sky Rogue, anyway? It... Doesn't exist. It may be because this game is still in early access (and it's one of the more complete early access games out there to boot!), but as of right now, March 19, 2017 (for those reading this review on dates that are NOT March 19, 2017), this game has no discernable plot. Which, really is a shame, because this is the kind of game that NEEDS a plot besides mindlessly blowing sh*t up. The soundtrack is very good, and fits the overall tone of the game, with the same style.\n\nOverall, I'd strongly advise spending the $17.80 to get both the game and OST.", "timestamp_created": 1489926931, "timestamp_updated": 1489926931, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501511", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30511961": {"recommendationid": "30511961", "author": {"steamid": "76561198151187661", "num_games_owned": 179, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 472, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509057978}, "language": "english", "review": "Makes you feel like one of those 90's anime fighter pilots.

original Playstation Air and Ace Combat games.  Sky Rogue harkins back to the flight combat days of old.  Not-too-serious physics coupled with beautiful polygon graphics and old school sphere explosions bring a smile to ones face not to mention a sweat to your brow.  I haven't played a game like this in over 20 years and it's really refreshing to come back to this style game.  One key difference in this new revision of an old school genre is the large variety of weapons and planes at your disposal.  From light nimble fighters to massive heavy bombers and 20mm vulcan cannons to UB2 unguided bombs the aircraft and weapon selection stays fresh enough to keep you entertained and experimenting with new combos.  I would also definitely recommend checking out the community guides as you dive into the game just to get an understanding of what weaponry and tactics work for certain situations in-game.  \n\nSky Rogue is in beta now and already feels like a finished product.

It was really, really fucking hard but god damn was it satisfying. So now that I've finally beaten Sky Rogue, you better buckle the fuck up buttercup 'cause here comes the review train.\n\nSky Rogue is fucking rad. It's a great mix of what feels like Ace Combat and roguelite elements, with a sort of Starfox 64 graphical vibe. Islands and missions are random, giving you nice variety every time you play. I would highly reccommend a controller or flight stick, because playing with mouse and keyboard is like trying to find the cheesecake crumbs inside a fat fuck's folds. You just can't do it, the cheesecake is gone, just like your will to live will be if you play with mouse and keyboard. There are 10 days to get through, and after day 3 you better put on your big boy pants before the catholic priest that is this game rapes you with difficulty. Seriously, day 4 will fuck your brains out till you're a steaming pile of sweat and cum on the floor. This game is very Dark Souls-esque difficulty wise, meaning you need to train yourself on every mechanic of this game and perfect everything or else you'll get fucked like mommy on valentines day. There are upgrades that only stick with you throughout your one life, then there are points you get every death to spend on unlocking whole new ships/weapons/abilities that stick around forever, like a fleeting meth addiction.

Although there are no presettings for using a Joystick, the setup is pretty quick and easy. You can personalize all buttons very well and thus, I strongly recommend using a joystick or better a HOTAS for the game, which I believe is crucial for the fun factor of the game.\n\nGameplay feels GREAT. You can literally feel all the properties of the different plane types you are flying and the effects of how you fly. The principle is very easy to learn and becomes more and more challenging, as you fly different random mission from your base (A flying Aircraft carrier). You will have to either destroy enemy bases on the ground in awesome bombing runs or battle bogeys and aces in challenging dogfights with your steadily growing arsenal of all different sorts of weapons. Once you successfully complete a mission and return to your base, a new mission will wait for you. With every mission you complete, your enemies will get stronger and harder to ward off, but if you die once, you will be back at the beginning and have to start all over again. All upgrades you afforded will also be lost. \nFor each kill, you will earn Tech points (which are not going to be reset) and proceed in your Tech Level, wich will unlock new planes and weapons. The planes not only differ as to how they look like, but there is also a great deal changed about their handling, speed and their payload (How much weaponry they can carry)\n\nThe gameplay itself is pretty easy to master but still quite challenging. Your weapon pool's arsenal consists of guide Air to Air missiles and Air to Ground missiles which will have to be locked on to an enemy before firing them off, bombs, unguided missiles and machine guns/Flaks. You always have to carefully chose, which weapons to take with you in which plane, as they have limited payloads and only four slots.\nYou also have the ability to equip a fifth slot either with flares (You can dump flares to ward off enemy missiles), drone wingmans which can be launched to help you or a speed booster. \nThere are different skins you can fit to your planes for every personal style. All of them look good.\n\nGRAPHICS\n\nThere isn't much to say about Graphics. Sky Rogue's Graphics are not at all impressive, but they have a very nice low-polygon style. Though there are many low-polygon games, Sky Rogue maintains a very personal style, making the game charming and unique. Thus, the performance is great, even on low-end PCs like mine (Intel Core 0.03 at 1Hz), even at highest graphic settings. \n\nMODDING\n\nModding is one of the most important features of this game. Even if you might get tired of the main game after a few hours of playing it, there will be always an extremely wide range of mods which feature awesome fictional and real-world airplanes to get a new shot of enthusiasm into your veins and also custom missions. Mods are also verz easz to create and if you are looking for a particulat plane and can't find it, there are plenty of guides to help you create your personal mod.\n*HOWEVER* Don't tap into the trap of downloading OP planes like I did before, as this will destroy the fun factor completely. It should always be challenging!\n\nREVIEW\n\nThis game is AWESOME and well worth the 10 quit. You will get that top gun feeling, shooting down endlessly many bogeys and bombing infinitely many buildings, Dodging enemy missiles with daring barrel roll maneuvers and dumping flares at them. This game is what you are going to be in the skies. an ACE!\n\nIf you like Arcade Flight 'Sim' - BUY NOW!\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1480803352, "timestamp_updated": 1480803352, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.570002", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "28001511": {"recommendationid": "28001511", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076086519", "num_games_owned": 59, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1186, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497752834}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10 absolute best airplane fighter simulator!!!", "timestamp_created": 1480373233, "timestamp_updated": 1480373233, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.469043", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "27791093": {"recommendationid": "27791093", "author": {"steamid": "76561198128169254", "num_games_owned": 32, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 999, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504362373}, "language": "english", "review": "Hmmm this is a good one, the \"campagin\" although is pure arcade style, still has a lot of variety and freedom to it.\nMission objective ranges from A2G, A2A, and even anti ship missions.\nAnother thing I personally like is that after completing the objective you can hang around and battle as many enemy air unit as you wish or until you get shot down.\nLanding on the carrier is actually a bit tricky if you turn arcade control off and have full control of yaw, pitch and roll.\nAlso you get to pilot a large number of aircrafts, from fighter to bomber to intercepter.\nModding community is also amazing, a large number of schump classics are available, although too many mods will incrase loading time drastically.", "timestamp_created": 1480235352, "timestamp_updated": 1480235352, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547291", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "27765640": {"recommendationid": "27765640", "author": {"steamid": "76561198103067828", "num_games_owned": 749, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 313, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505084854}, "language": "english", "review": "The perfect game to play when youre looking for a flying, top gun esque challenge.

The latest updates have made it possible to get to levels without dodging missiles left and right. Don't expect to fly in and out without a scratch, but the looming bullet hell common with rogue-likes is absent during earlier levels.\n\nIf you have a spare controller, you and a buddy can play through missions co-op, which in my experience is rather fun.\n\nNow that I've praised the game, I must also point out some of its flaws. The first and most irritating (to me) is repeating missions. The first time you bomb some enemy HQ it is alright. Not after the 5th time.\nMy suggestion would be to stack mission objectives, but hey, this is a review.\n\nThe second game aspect is the lack of online multiplayer and/or a dogfight mode for multiplayer. That's just something I feel that a fly-em-up should have if it includes multiplayer. At least some local network co-op would be nice.\n\n\nWhen all is said and done, Sky Rogue is a great early access game that has potential to be that title that fills the gap between hardcore flight sims and flight games that just don't offer much for those looking for replayability.

[/u]\n\nWith the lack of real triple-A flight simulators coming out lately, Sky Rogue attempts to take the reigns and create an arcade-like aircraft game. But does it succeed?\n\n[u] Gameplay [/u]\n\nI'll be happy to report that the gameplay is the highlight of Sky Rogue. Choosing from a variety of planes which you unlock, as well as a loadout from a colorful and fun weapon pool, you take to the skies in a brillant fashion. Launched from your mothership, you complete randomly assigned missions. This can range from average bombings to taking on entire battleships. \n\nMovement feels fluid, and you can feel the agility and weight of your planes with every sick turn or twist. For evasion, you have a simple, but effective dodge roll which usually throws missiles off. Barring that, you can equip flares for a big middle finger towards your missile slinging foes. Your weapons are large-scale and always ready to chew up the opposition. Explosives, lock-on missiles, machine guns, and much more are available as you steadily progress through the game. When you inevitably get shot down, you are sent back to mission 1, but not before unlocking some permanently acquired equipment with your hard earned \"Tech\" points. \n\nNote that this game works with your HOTUS setup, and (apparently) feels great!\n\n[u] Graphics [/u]\n\nThe graphics of Sky Rogue aren't exactly impressive, but have a very low-polygon charm that is done intentionally. It looks great and doesn't seem to impede with performance too much. Certainly colorful as well, with bright explosions, gaudy color schemes, and a blue sky at your hull.\n\n[u] Performance [/u]\n\nRuns great, even on my potato of a PC. Supports DirectX9 and DirectX11. Solid 60 while playing on the highest graphics, and even runs at 50-60 while recording if I bump the graphics down to low.\n\n[u] Longevity [/u]\n\nSky Rogue has a modding community that seems fairly talented and dedicated to making up some ridiculously cool or funny looking planes. Custom missions are also littered through the workshop, though I haven't personally tried any of them out. The developers are responsive and work at a moderate pace. They seem to have things sorted out, though they also seem behind schedule. Still, the game currently has a fairly good amount of content, well worth its 10 dollar price tag.\n\n[u] Verdict [/u]\n\nNow this is what I'd call a great flght-and-flight game. You'll feel like a real badass ace flying through the skies, shooting down enemy drones and bombing countless amounts of buildings, all while dodging the wall of missiles and flak that impede you fruitlessly. \n\nWell worth the 10 dollars, be sure to get it while it's hot!", "timestamp_created": 1479491287, "timestamp_updated": 1479491287, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.566756", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "26623545": {"recommendationid": "26623545", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023429637", "num_games_owned": 170, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 2732, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507397399}, "language": "english", "review": "This game has a lonnnngggg way to go before being feature-complete, but here is The Story So Far\u2122\n\nThe base game itself has a wide range of specialized fighters and weapons with either minor or major differences, a well put-together ordinance system revolving around either sheer demolishing power or electronics, with most weapons requiring at least a bit of both, with the standard GUN being one of few exceptions.\n\nThe fighters all have a place in combat, and the only ship with ballanced stats, the namesake of the game, the Rogue, is basic and expensive to upgrade, but so worth it as the stat boosts are one of the highest in the game of basic fighters.\nAlthough it [i]is[/i] a stinkin' rogue-like* tech points you earned can unlock new craft and ordinance.

The game has been expanded with a much larger variety of aircraft, weapons and enemies, along with a more defined gameplay loop that sees you struggling to keep your win streak going while rewarding you for persistence even after your eventual demise.\n\nWhile Skyrogue draws inspiration from real world aerial combat (military enthusaists will be pleased to see clear distinctions between unguided, infrared, active and semi-active radar guided weapons), expect the game to use its near-future aesthetic to hand-wave and err on the side of arcade fun rather than technical realism.\n\nPros:\n- Responsive and intuitive controls\n- Satisfying \"game feel\" -- combat is always a thrill, especially when that swarm of enemy ACES show up on the horizon to ruin your bombing run\n- Aircraft and weapons feel distinct, and all feel useful in the right situation\n- Leaves you with that \"just one more sortie\" feeling\n- Great mod support and workshop content\n\nCons:\n- A few odd bugs still hanging around\n- The music (while great) lacks variety; maybe throw \"danger zone\" on in the background once in a while to spice it up yourself\n- The environment, while randomly generated each time, can seem monotonous without a variety of tiles -- you'll find no mountains, lakes or rivers on the islands of Skyrogue", "timestamp_created": 1467572892, "timestamp_updated": 1467572892, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "24042088": {"recommendationid": "24042088", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970329636", "num_games_owned": 339, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 310, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495385021}, "language": "english", "review": "60 fps, Split screen co-op, controller support and steam workshop.\nLots of fun!\nCan play as Gundam Core Fighter, an X-wing and the ship from Galaga, to name a few.\n\nGood stuff.", "timestamp_created": 1467536306, "timestamp_updated": 1467536306, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "24009983": {"recommendationid": "24009983", "author": {"steamid": "76561198253773809", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 677, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467996853}, "language": "english", "review": "once you get good at this game, it can be really addicting and the beautiful graphics and fun gameplay mechanics make it an absolute indulgence. blowing up enemy planes and slowly chipping away at structures if incredibly rewarding. however the game can be really frustrating for the first couple of hours as the controls are simple but confusing. i'd recommend using arrow keys and aswd keys together because it's far more difficult to use the mouse + aswd keys.", "timestamp_created": 1467450007, "timestamp_updated": 1467450007, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23937267": {"recommendationid": "23937267", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119638825", "num_games_owned": 225, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 24, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487693210}, "language": "english", "review": "I've only played the tutorial mission at this point and I already have things to say.\n\nPros:\n\n1.

Explosions are satisfying both with the sound effects and the little camera shake. Good impact.\n\n3. The light cel shading adds a very nice touch to the graphics, and its all very colorful.\n\n4. Its very fun.\n\n5. Locking on gives this cool cinematic feel that you dont see in other games.\n\nCons:\n\n1. When you pause the game it kinda just carries over whatever sound effect is going on,instead of muting it entirely, which is annoying because I might be pausing to look at a video or answer a call.\n\n2. The camera is all or nothing. It will swivel entirely to one side when you use the gamepad controls.

The game is fun in short bursts as a palette-cleanser, but unless you're really into shooting the same stuff over and over again then I doubt this is the kind of game that you'll be playing for hours at a time.  The \"procedurally generated\" missions aren't what they're cracked up to be; everything's going to look and feel exactly the same on every single playthrough. Difficulty curve is pretty inconsistent too; Days 1 and 2 are usually pretty easy, Day 3 provides an enjoyable challenge, and Day 4 and beyond is balls-to-the-wall batshit insane. This cycle last for about 15 minutes and then after you get your asshole ravaged the game boots you back to Day 1 again. It's a little jarring; I think the difficulty should start off just a tad bit harder, but it shouldn't skyrocket as quickly as it does.\n\nWith the negative stuff out of the way...the game controls great. I don't play a lot of flying games (my flying experience is limited to stuff like Just Cause and GTA) and in my opinion the flight model is a great balance between realistic and arcade-y. You won't be accounting for heavy wind or lightly adjusting your trim, but you also won't be turning at angles sharp enough to tear a plane apart or kill the pilot with g-forces either. On keyboard, the controls are awkward at first but if you have enough patience you can get used to it. An Xbox 360 controller, on the other hand, instantly feels natural with default settings. The game's also playable with my Logitech Wingman Extreme 3D, although it was a little tricky to bind the controls at first.\n\ntl;dr Sky Rogue is repetitive and hard, but if you enjoy shooting things with a plane and don't care too much about realism then it's a good way to kill a few minutes.

If you have ever had fun with an air combat game in the past, give this one a look. Currently in heavy development, its sole developer Forkbeard, is very active on the forums, providing help, and listening to suggestions. (Actually false, there are two devs, Forkbeard and Delko Duck, they both show up on the forums and discord to chat/help.)\n\nIt has a small community, but it's very friendly, and willing to help anyone in need. Right now the game also has workshop support for custom aero skins, and simple custom missions. So if you have any particular aircraft you are a fan of, if it's not already there, make a request and somone will probably fulfill it.\n\nThe game has only a few modes to choose from right now, a day by day, increasing in difficulty rouge-like campaign; a local co-op version of it, so you can play with a friend; along with a free flight mode where you can perform acrobatics to your hearts content. It has a tutorial, which will teach you the basics of flying and fighting, and with simple controls, it's easy to pick up.\n(It now has more modes, the proper campaign ending with a final boss, an endless, days-get-harder mode based on the original campagin, free-flight, and of course co-op.)\n\nAnyway, i'm both enjoying the game right now, and looking forward to the games development in the future. This is a purchace I do not regret one bit.\n\n11-24-2017 EDIT: As of 8-24-2017, I have been promoted to the Steam forum community moderator for Sky Rogue, however, my review still stands.

This is not a game about realism or technical complexity, nor about peaceful and lengthy flights. It bears far more resemblance to StarFox or classic Top Gun games than to DCS or Falcon BMS. You will be fighting enemies the minute you're off the deck, often in overwhelming numbers. Ammunition recharges, and planes can pull of maneuvers a MiG pilot could only dream of. But there is balance in Sky Rogue's simplicity. It packs in arcade-y style to make it fun to just pick up and play, but it retains just enough realism to make you feel like you're actually flying. The planes are more maneuverable than some real-life aircraft, but you do still have to think about stalling, gravity, and how your speed is affecting your turn rate. Ammunition regenerates, but weapons have limitations like radar cones. Everything, whether flying, shooting, or dodging enemy fire, has a nice visceral feel to it. \n\nSky Rogue is the perfect pick-up-and-play combat flight sim. There's enough complexity of systems and skill required to give it longevity, but you won't need to watch a 4-hour tutorial just to be able to play the game.

Woohoo!)\n\nSky Rouge is a simple concept. You fly your plane around, shooting down everything you see. However, the game manages to take this concept to a new level of depth. Even though you start with one plane and a meager collection of armaments, you raise your Tech Level with progress gained by shooting down enemy planes and destroying targets that can be on land, in the water, or even in the air! Each 'day' has a specific set of targets to destroy before you can make your way back to your carrier and complete the level, where you can make temporary upgrades to your gear. When you die, your experience is totaled up, and if you've leveled up, you can pick from various new aircraft and weaponry. Starting over generates a new island, and you can take off and try again. All of the controls feel responsive, and it's a snap to get the hang of piloting your Aero. I've had a blast with this game ever since I got it, and I think you will too.\n\n\nIn the end, Sky Rouge is a game that wholly deserves both your time and money.

Honestly has a Nintendo feel to it\n\n+Lots of cool jets and weapons: all the jets are awesome, and you can completely customize their loadouts. you'll soon find out why people during the Vietnam war that thought jets like the F-4 Phantom wouldn\u2019t need gun armament anymore quickly changed their minds... and why jets still have cannon armament today...\n\n+Replayability: When Warthunder or World of Warplanes pisses me off... time to fire up Skyrouge and let off some steam. You can sink hours into this game. And its procedurally generated missions mean you never know what your going to find when your plane leaves the deck...\n\n+Easy and enjoyable: No trashy, half done, \"sorta but not really realistic\" physics here. Its simple, and anyone can do it and be good at it.\n\n+Portable: The game barely downloads at 200mb. And its obviously not graphically intense, which means it would run just fine on your laptop. Works great on mine.\n\n+No bugs... not an exaggeration! I honestly haven\u2019t encountered one yet...\n\nNow for some Cons:\n\n-Repetitive soundtrack: its fun for the first few hours, but starts to get annoying, different tunes for each battle would be nice...\n\n-Difficult controls: Yah you REALY need an Xbox remote or a Joystick to get complete satisfaction playing this. Anyone that thinks they can just use their keyboard and mouse are in for a very frustrating time\u2026 most of the bad reviews your going to see are rants about this\u2026  GET A XBOX REMOTE!\n\nOld school \"when you die your dead\" progression system: Not really a problem to be honest: when you get shot down, you start all over. However your pilot continues to level up as you play, so you can keep the jets and missiles you unlock. It plays like a First Gen Sonic or Mario game. The whole game plays like survival mode in Modern Warfare. When you die, its back to level one. Might be annoying for spoiled newer gamers. ;-)\n\nUm... cant think of anything else... there\u2019s almost nothing else I have to say bad about the game.\n\nTired of the grind fest and the unrewarding experience of Warthunder or any other of the big combat sims?\n\nHonestly get this. Its a good game, simple to play, and best of all, its FUN.

Start over. \n\n\nThe real tragedy of the obnoxious difficulty curve is that it presses the player into a more narrow choice of play-styles than the game would seem to otherwise allow. There are ground attack missions, but don't try making a low-altitude loadout based on rockets or cannons because enemy fighters and SAMS will vaporize you. The only way to survive ground attack missions is to drop bombs on your target from a mile away and flee back to your carrier before more fighters spawn. Those giant long-range interceptor missiles look cool, but don't ever use them because enemy fighters turn on a dime and dodge them every time. Even dogfights are reduced to nothing but an endless turning battle with stupidly maneuverable enemies while you mash the button that deploys your (finite) countermeasures to deflect their (infinite) missiles. Half the planes go unused because they can't survive the world the game generates. It's frustrating, but more importantly it's monotonous.\n\nI'm thinking the flight sim format doesn't blend well with roguelike elements like procedural generation and permadeath. The game gives you the tools of a traditional flight sim but they're the wrong tools to deal with the challenges of a roguelike. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1445791383, "timestamp_updated": 1445791383, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.583056", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "18511392": {"recommendationid": "18511392", "author": {"steamid": "76561198082121318", "num_games_owned": 110, "num_reviews": 63, "playtime_forever": 500, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484852505}, "language": "english", "review": "Simple and nice looking, plus easy controls, and it supports mods!

The amount you can research is based on your tech level, which, in turn, is based off kills. This sets up a nice incentive for you, the player: to stay in a mission, getting lots of kills to upgrade your tech when you eventually falter, or to leave sooner to get a further run. \n\nAlso, theres mod support.

As you play and kill stuff you get cash and experience and increase your 'tech level', unlocking new stuff as your tech level increases. If you are killed in a mission, you cash in your XP and money, select new items/weapons/planes to unlock and start again from level 1.\n\nAn interesting feature I enjoy is being able to choose the load-outs for every plane you have unlocked and being able to use any one of these planes during a mission, switching between them by landing on your carrier. This lets you play with tactics, choosing planes with large load capacity which can take a lot of punishment and using them as bombers, while choosing planes with good avionics and speed as fighters. Something to note, when you are killed, your loadouts are reset and some weapons are relocked, meaning you have to repurchase the weapons you want to use (if they are now locked) and resetup your loadouts.\n\nTl:dr - Fun little rogue-like with a decent amount of replayability for those who like quick drop-in games (20 minutes or so at a time). Unlockable content seems to slow down by level 25 and the missions, enemies and islands are failr samey. Combat feels fun and fairly fast-paced, weapons have a decent feel to them.\n\nFor \u00a36.99?

Where do I start here? I guess I'll start with a question. You! Yes, you, Reader. Don't look at me like that. The fourth wall cannot protect you here. What did you think this was, a work of fiction? No, this is a video game review. Now shut up and listen, because I'm monologuing here and I will not have my rhetorical questions interrupted with that uncouth glare of yours.\n   Really. Am I going to have to confiscate your eyebrows?\n   No?\n   Good. \n   As I was trying to say before I was so rudely interrupted: I would like to start this with a question. That is do you, the reader with the funny eyebrows and the tendency to rudely throw a writer off his train of thought, like to blow stuff up? \n   If the answer to that question's yes, then you will like this game.  \n   It's really somewhat more complicated than that - you will also, for instance, need to learn to fly a variety of aircraft in a variety of horrifically dangerous situations, many of them involving missile spam, bullet spam, enemy spam, turret spam, and very nearly every other kind of spam except the true, original, Monty-Python-Sketch-Inspiring ham-like meat product. (Incidentally, that sketch is where the term \"spam\" comes from. See, we can learn things even on the internet! Knowledge! It ain't just for breakfast!) Simply put, this game's a blast. The levels are procedural, with mission objectives chosen semi-randomly from a list of possibilities; the more missions you complete, the more hideously dangerous the skies become. And, of course, dying sets the counter back to day 1.  \n   The game does have its downsides - it's an early access title, so there are some hiccups in the current build. For instance, sometimes a target won't recognize that it's dead and will linger in your targeting system until you fly away and find something else to shoot at. And in the indev version, there's that finicky little thing where pressing \"back\" in a menu will instantly ask you if you want to return to the title screen, resulting in some wacky hijinx and occasional selection glitchery.  \n   But if you're willing to overlook a handful of minor flaws for the chance to fly around blasting minions like the Red Baron on way too much caffiene, then this is a game for you! The devs update regularly and respond to the community on their Steam page fairly often; mods are supported, up to and including ships from Wing Commander and Cowboy Bebop, and, of course, with a certain loadout you can barrel roll between the hails of missiles like Starfox on a Tuesday afternoon! \n   Final summation: if you like your flight sims, give this game a shot. If you like explosions, give this game a shot. If you like arcadey shoot-em-ups where you get to perform flights of flying-ace-like derring-do - I think you see where this is going - give this game a shot.\n", "timestamp_created": 1441455593, "timestamp_updated": 1441455593, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "17888191": {"recommendationid": "17888191", "author": {"steamid": "76561198196211866", "num_games_owned": 104, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 341, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508134080}, "language": "english", "review": "Part Ace Combat, part Minecraft, all radical.

This gets you: a single level, a small cluster of islands in the middle of the ocean. Not a lot, admittedly. The landmass in the middle of the ocean might be randomly generated between waves; I didn't pay enough attention to tell you if they were. At the start of play, you're given an objective or objectives (\"HANGAR\", \"2 COMMAND\", \"3 AWACS\" etc), and you customize your plane and weapon loadout to suit your needs. You start with a single plane with three basic weapons, but upon subsequent deaths you unlock more weapons and planes in what seems to be some hidden slot machine mechanic. \n\nYou then launch from your skybound aircraft carrier, blow up designated targets, and then fly back to the carrier to end the \"Day,\" the game's designation for waves.  The game ups you to the next day, with harder enemies and more objectives. You're given the chance to reconfigure your aircraft before the next mission. Fairly simple.\n\nThe game's strength lies in its tight control scheme. Controls are responsive; your sci-fi jet fighter, obedient. Those who have played Ace Combat will feel instant familiarity, though the traditional button to change targets in AC is, in Sky Rogue, the button to swap weapons. I suffered several rounds of accidentally cycling through my weapons before I had the good sense to change the key bindings on my 360 gamepad. Chasing down enemy fighters, dodging missiles, and swerving out of the way of enemy AWACS tumbling out of the sky is a treat, particularly for those of us longing for Namco to revive the AC franchise. \n\nThere are some downsides that make Sky Rogue tough to recommend. For one, you're locked into a single, uninteresting map. After a few rounds, I was desperate for something\u2014ANYTHING\u2014different than green clumps surrounded by blue water. Second, the music. Rather, the song. There is a single tune that accompanies you in the air, a chiptune throwback to the SNES era. It's highly reminisicent of a Starfox tune, and while it starts out catchy it soon becomes irksomely repetitive. \n\nLast, and most important, is the unfortunate fact that most the mission objectives are a chore. If the game is feeling charitable, it might throw a couple AWACS planes your way. Chasing down the AWACS and their fighter escorts is fast and tense\u2014one might forget they weren't playing Ace Combat for a minute. Sadly, the common objectives are fortified ground targets, buildings that take many, many passes with anti-ground ordinance to destroy. From Day 3 onwards, these ground objectives are surrounded by long-range SAM sites, making carpet bombing from above the ideal tactic. This is exceptionally boring, as it requires you to line up your shots with an insufferable slow targeting reticle that shrinks when your plane is not pitching or yawing, and then turn around and repeat the process multiple times. Worse, as you'll have brought an aircraft built around bombing and not air-to-air intercept for these, you'll be at the AI's mercy when it throws its higher level fighters at you.\n\nThe game is in Early Access, but there's the rub: as we've seen over and over the past couple years, there's no guarantee that an EA game will ever progress beyond its current alpha form.  After a couple hours of play, I was stuck with the feeling, \"Is that all there is?\" I tend to play Ace Combat on Ace difficulty, and it does not take long for me to reach the point where I can progress no further in Sky Rogue. I hit my inevitable death after passing by for my fourth bombing run of a target, get tossed back to the beginning, and it feels like something's missing. Variety, perhaps. Or maybe I'm missing the fun. There's a game in here somewhere that I very much enjoy and very much want to play more of, but it's locked behind uninteresting, ultimately futile bombing missions on an unintersting group of islands in the middle of an uinteresting sea. Ultimate, Sky Rogue strikes me as one of those games that comes inside another game as a distraction or Easter egg, not a retail product. \n\nPerhaps the game will expand, but perhaps not. This is Early Access, after all, where nothing is certain. I would not hedge my bets on the game making good on its implicit promise of scratching that itch we feel for a good arcade flight game, and cannot, therefore, in good conscience recommend this game. If you are absolutely desperate to feel the thrill of the Ace Combat games, wait for a sale. Yes, it's only $10, but you should still wait for a sale. \n\nI also hear that a PS2 emulator will play AC4 just fine, so there's that.", "timestamp_created": 1440198501, "timestamp_updated": 1440198608, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 26, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.655170", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "17651212": {"recommendationid": "17651212", "author": {"steamid": "76561198095014565", "num_games_owned": 111, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3825, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507115836}, "language": "russian", "review": "This is the fly-em-up that I didn't know I wanted.

experienced, but I'm even more impressed by how remarkably well-balanced the missions are. Missions objectives generally consist of destroying static targets surrounded by defenses like AA guns and SAM sites. In early missions you can dodge or ignore defenses and take out targets directly, but it soon becomes necessary to remove layers of defense before you can attack targets without being blown apart by a hail of missiles. You can return to base to repair your plane or switch to a different plane or loadout, allowing you to specialize for the current phase of the mission, but spawners---carriers in the air and aerodromes on the ground---pose an interesting complication, since you need to balance your capability to destroy the aircraft they're launching and the spawner itself.\n\nThere are multiple effective strategies. For dispatching enemy aircraft you can outfit a maneuverable craft with fast, short-range missiles and engage in topsy-turvy dogfights, but with too many foes in the mix you'll inevitably take some hits, and maneuverable planes aren't so durable. Or you can put long-range missiles in a fast interceptor, outrun your enemies, and be the ultimate jouster, but this isn't as expedient as close-in dogfirghting and you might not be able to destroy enemies as fast as a spawner produces them. Or can try to make an all-around fighter that's decent at all three of dogfighting, ranged anti-air, and bombing, and hope you're still nimble enough to win dogfights. Yes, you can switch planes mid-mission, but if you're being pursued by a faster enemy you might not survive the trip back to base. Ground targets can also be taken out multiple ways: bombed from altitude, dive-bombed, or strafed with rockets, guns, and cannons.\n\nIt only takes a few hours to unlock almost all the planes and items, giving you a wide variety of loadouts and strategies to experiment with, and 14 hours in I'm still uncovering new strategies for getting to later missions.

Inutile de la faire longue et m\u00eame si je ne suis pas un grand amateur du genre, il me semble quand m\u00eame pouvoir dire que Sky Rogue fournit d\u00e9j\u00e0 tout ce que je pouvais attendre d'un tel titre.\nSimple \u00e0 prendre en main, sensation en retrait mais tout \u00e0 fait valables, des engins aux caract\u00e9ristiques simples et lisibles, des objectif de tous types, de l'armement vari\u00e9 ... Il \u00e0 vraiment pris tous les bons ingr\u00e9dients, les plus simples et les plus efficaces.\n\n[h1]Une partie[/h1]\nComment est-ce que \u00e7a se d\u00e9roule ? Vous d\u00e9butez toute les parts sur le pont d'un porte-avions volant, syst\u00e9matiquement vous \u00eates libre de s\u00e9lectionner votre engin, son \u00e9quipement et un skin. Vous \u00eates alors propulsez dans les airs pour aller accomplir une mission al\u00e9atoire quelque part sur l'\u00eele au dessous de vous. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=498259463 \u2014 en l'air l'avion avance tout seul, son r\u00e9gime moteur est constant, la dessus vous pouvez agir pour prendre de la vitesse, pour sortir les a\u00e9rofrein et ralentir. Bien entdu vous bouger dans les 3 dimensions avec votre clavier/pad et avec un syst\u00e8me discret pour virer \u00e0 gauche ou \u00e0 droite de mani\u00e8re \"stable\" mais selon un angle tr\u00e8s large. \n\u2014 sur l'\u00eele, il y a \u00e0 boire et manger, tour de contr\u00f4le, hangar, DCA fixe, lance missile fixe, des bateaux et sous marins au large de la c\u00f4te. D'autre a\u00e9ronefs porte-avions sont \u00e9galement pr\u00e9sent pour faire d\u00e9coller des engins ennemis ou des drones. Bref, cela laisse de quoi r\u00e9aliser toute sortes de manoeuvres et d'approches. \n\u2014 Il n'y a pas de dogfight, vous surplombez de mani\u00e8re subjective votre appareil, une cam\u00e9ra libre est pr\u00e9sente pour vous assister. Un hud permet d'acqu\u00e9rir les cibles et une fois \u00e0 port\u00e9e il les verrouille automatiquement. Le changement de cibles est existe bien entendu. Toutes les armes que vous pouvez \u00e9quiper on des port\u00e9es \u00e0 respecter pour \u00eatre efficace. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=498259805 \u2014 vous pouvez \u00eatre verrouiller vous-m\u00eame et utiliser certaines manoeuvres pour vous d\u00e9gager ou encore des contre mesures \"flare\" si dispo. \nSelon votre appareil vous serez plus ou moins resistant. Plus la maniabilit\u00e9 de l'avion est grande plus il est fragile.  Seules les salves peuvent s'\u00e9puiser, si 5 tirs sont possibles vous pourrez tirer les 5 et ensuite les r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer selon un temps de rechargement. Vous pouvez toujours vous poser sur votre porte avion ou une de vos bases au sols pour r\u00e9parer ou recharger en flare (qui eux ne sont pas illimit\u00e9). C'est un titre arcacde, pour vous poser, vous devrez simplement survoler la pister \u00e0 basse \u00e0 altitude pour d\u00e9cl\u00e9ncher l'atterissage. \n\n[h1]Rogue ?[/h1] Le titre se veut \"rogue-like\", c'est dans l'air du temps j'imagine. Donc, en vous battant vous gagnerez des points de recherches et de l'argent. Les recherches d\u00e9verouillent de mani\u00e8re permatente des avions ou des armes. L'argent permet de d'acheter ses armes et ne sont perdues que si vous vous \u00e9crasez. La partie suivante vous recommencerez \u00e0 la mission 1, avec vos recherches en l'\u00e9tat et votre portefeuille. \nSinc\u00e8rement, l'aspect Rogue est bizarre, le jeu n'en a pas besoin et je dirais que c'est simplement mal senti de la part des d\u00e9vs. d'avoir orient\u00e9 le jeu l\u00e0 dessus. Mais \u00e7a ne gache pas grand chose au plaisir. \n\n[h1]Faiblesses et Early Access[/h1]\nC\u00f4t\u00e9 d\u00e9fauts, il y a quelques remarques de moindres importances \u00e0 relever. Le d\u00e9cors et leur style cassent un peu les sensations, car avec des grand polygones aux arr\u00eates saillantes, difficile de r\u00e9aliser sa propre vitesse, certaines \u00e9chapp\u00e9es \"raz-du-sol\" en deviennent molles. Les combats sont un rien trop simples, bombarder en boucle un batiment  jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'il explose. Manoeuvrer pour passer derri\u00e8re un avion ennemi. Le titre mise sur votre facult\u00e9 \u00e0 rester en vie longtemps et \u00e0 vous m\u00e9nager plutot que de r\u00e9aliser une op\u00e9ration unique mais tr\u00e8s pr\u00e9cise. \n\nLa difficult\u00e9 augmente avec la succession des missions et comme dans GTA, un niveau d'alerte selon vos actions est pr\u00e9sent, il d\u00e9termine combien de drones/avions seront \u00e0 vos trousses.\nJe regrette aussi que le titre ne mise pas plus sur les combats a\u00e9riens, qui sont infiniement plus gratifiant que les cibles au sol, m\u00eame quand elles sont bien prot\u00e9g\u00e9es. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=498259742 Niveau contenu, c'est syst\u00e8matiquement la m\u00eame \u00eele avec des bat\u00eements variables. Armes et avions ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 un nombre int\u00e9ressant de variantes (j'ai du voir 5 avions, de l'\u00e9claireur ultra l\u00e9ger au petit bombardier, l'armement doit comporter une 15enes d'\u00e9l\u00e9ments, missile IR AA, bombe en piqu\u00e9e, canon avant, ... mais \u00e0 ce niveau l\u00e0, on ne peut jamais en faire trop.\n\nFinalement j'esp\u00e8re que cet Early Access lui permettra de trouver cette vari\u00e9t\u00e9 dans les sc\u00e9narii et de se pencher un peu plus sur des combats entre cibles mouvantes.

Each mission also presents numerous optional objectives which you can destroy for additional credit towards unlocking the next tech, which can be new aircraft, weapons, or utility items like afterburners and IR flares. \n\nThis game is rather reminiscent of the sleeper gem Starfighter for 3D0, which had similar graphics and open-world objectives (and many other remarkable features).\n\nVisually the game is appealingly simple, flat vector graphics with striking aircraft designs featuring pleasant details and moving parts that react to your control of the craft, such as a swing-wing interceptor that changes configuration as you accelerate.\n\nThe controls are smooth using a gamepad. \n\nDid I mention it has local co-op with splitscreen?\n\nI bought three games the other day, this one was the cheapest and also completely dominated my attention out of the three.

In a single word, superb.\n-Replayability. Set in a world where the average pilot life expectancy is less than two days, the focus on flight combat and procedurally generated maps keeps the gameplay fresh. You'll play those first few days over and over, but you'll find it just as fun as the AI finds you repulsive and in need of death.\n\nNot so much:\n-Music. There is one track that plays during flight. That's it. It's catchy, but it's just the one.\n-Control. Mouse is kind of finicky, so I've been going all keyboard. I'd prefer to use my flightstick (Logitech Extreme 3D Pro), but all it can do is control roll and pitch, and the buttons are somehow completely useless. Your experience with a flightstick may differ. Better options for editing joystick/controller inputs will probably come in future updates (I hope).\n-Stats. This game should track pilot statistics.

Rather than delete it, I just decided to put this in to tell you to skip to the next paragraph if you're not interested. [/b] So i was going to the steam store after a little vacation away from my pc with my family, to check out new deals, and this review window popped up for sky rogue, which i bought and played quite a lot of before I left. So, I figured I might as well write the review. Anyways, Sky Rogue is a nice little gem, if it was rather hidden for a while. (And still seems to be, as far as I know, I saw it had been released by looking at the new releases on the mobile steam app, as poorly designed as that app is. Like I said, it might have been on the front page, might not, idk) \nOn to the review. Sky Rogue is an interesting game, originally a game you could get for free (or pay for, if you liked it, which i think is pretty cool of the devs!) on their website, although i forgot what the site was. They might still have an old version up for free, last I knew they'd stopped releasing updates for free. It is a nice game, with a (imhop) neat art style, reminicsent of some more recent old arcade games that I can think of. The controlls are nice, as long as you have a controller, the keyboard and mouse controlls are ok, but not amazing. There are a few different building types and enemies, although I haven't gotten very far. It is a rogue-like, after all, you get tech points and cash by destroying enemies and buildings, and you can develop new technology using these tech points. Among these things you can unlock are new planes, bombs, homing missiles, guns, engines (which give special abilities like dodging and boost), etc. When you die, you lose some of the weapons you were carrying, but (thankfully) not the different planes. you then can use the money you earned to buy these back for use. It sounds kinda annoying, but it isn't too much of a bother. The missions are varied, whether to destroy a lab, large plane, or giant helicarrier with missiles and drones. there are many weapons, and I especially like using the bombs. There is something... beutifull about passing by a building from several kilometers in the air, and watching your carefully dropped cluster bombs hit their marks directly, as you fly into the distance. anyways, I definitely think this is well worth its cost, and that it is an amazing game.", "timestamp_created": 1438917048, "timestamp_updated": 1438917048, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494400", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "17422855": {"recommendationid": "17422855", "author": {"steamid": "76561198093354247", "num_games_owned": 167, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1080, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503701985}, "language": "english", "review": "3d luftrausers.", "timestamp_created": 1438912896, "timestamp_updated": 1438912896, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.588092", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "17422326": {"recommendationid": "17422326", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067214940", "num_games_owned": 100, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1450, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477333364}, "language": "english", "review": "Made it to Day 5, survived the mission, and then crashed while landing. 10/10 would throw my computer out the window again", "timestamp_created": 1438909205, "timestamp_updated": 1438909205, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499337", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "17421213": {"recommendationid": "17421213", "author": {"steamid": "76561198113880899", "num_games_owned": 117, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 105, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1450967595}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0412\u0435\u0441\u0435\u043b\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430:\n\n\u0414\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u043e \u0430\u0440\u043a\u0430\u0434\u043d\u0430\u044f, \u043d\u043e, \u043d\u0435\u0441\u043c\u043e\u0442\u0440\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u0430\u0440\u043a\u0430\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c, \u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u043e \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438 \u043d\u0435 \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043b\u0435\u0433\u043a\u0430\u044f. \u0418\u0418 \u0434\u0435\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u043d\u0435\u043f\u043b\u043e\u0445, \u043f\u043e\u043f\u043e\u0435\u0442\u044c \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0435\u0442 \u043d\u0430\u0434 \u0447\u0435\u043c, \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043d\u043e\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u0438\u0435 \u0442\u0438\u043f\u043e\u0432 \u0441\u0430\u043c\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0442\u043e\u0432 \u0438 \u0432\u043e\u043e\u0440\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u043a \u043d\u0438\u043c \u0436\u0435(\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0443\u0448\u043a\u0438, \u0440\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0442\u044b, \u043a\u0430\u0441\u0441\u0435\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0431\u043e\u043c\u0431\u044b).\n\u041d\u043e, \u043a \u0441\u043e\u0436\u0430\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044e, \u0432 \u0434\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043c\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442 \u0443 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u044b \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u043e\u0439 \u043c\u0438\u043d\u0443\u0441 -

The game attempts to provide the player with a large sandbox with several targets and objects to shoot and destroy.\n\nThe issue I have is not that it is graphically simplistic (it appears it's only for the aesthetic, and not even for higher frame rates or anything), the issue is not that the game is poorly set out or that menus are atrrocious.\nThe issue I have is that the game is not fun.\n\nAfter working the unintuitive camera and targeting system, you line up a shot and blow up enemy jets only to see a 2D explosion and the simple model slowly move down from where it was. The buildings when shot produce a particle effect and are absorbed into the ground at a rate comparible to osmosis.\nThen there's what you're doing. You have little idea what's shooting at you, and often it appears as if you're killed by an enemy sneezing at you.\n\nIn the game blurb at the top of the store page the last phrase \"when you die, you're dead\" is a silly tautology that makes little sence. But once you play the game realise that what that means is when you're shot down, your progress is reset and you start all over again.\n\nThat fits into the next part, the dificulty curve. Following the tutorial that a 3 year old could probably complete, you're thrown into a mission that has everything set up against you, enemy jets, SAMs, etc. So you have to go thorugh securing air superiority, then dominating the ground, THEN you can go and strafe at the mission dependent target.\n\nMore or less, the issue I have is not that this game is in Early Access and that so many parts of what I didn't like would change, my issue is that the core gameplay mechanic was not fun, it was not satisfying and importantly wasn't rewarding enough.

You really only need to blow up your target, but kills/destruction grant extra points and can reduce incoming fire during strafing runs. You'll have to decide between getting a mission done quickly at high risk, or try to endure long enough to take out all the defenses.\n\nWhen you inevitably die, you get XP based on your performance. If you level up, you'll get to pick a weapon/item/plane from a small random selection. Then you're thrown into a new Day 1 with a new mission. Every Day/Mission is randomly generated, going from 'moderate' on Day 1 to 'impossibly hard' a few days later.\n\nIn my first draft of this review, I said you could \"skip\" a day. I was incorrect. If you land on a friendly pad or return to your carrier BEFORE destroying your Mission Target, you can change your loadout and re-launch with full health. Once your target has been destroyed, landing on any pad will end the mission.\n\nI'm already happy with my purchase, I would definitely recommend this game to fans of other arcade-style flight games like Strike Vector, HAWX, Ace Combat Assault Horizon, or Crimson Skies.", "timestamp_created": 1438477694, "timestamp_updated": 1438560652, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 63, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.836604", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "17341006": {"recommendationid": "17341006", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048358678", "num_games_owned": 100, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 237, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1445058036}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is really, REALLY fun!

(Looking at you, Assault Horizon and JASF).  My benchmark, usually is the Ace Combat series.  (Specifically '5: The Unsung War'.)  But Sky Rogue doesn't really make that a fair comparison.  It feels more like Ace Combat mixed with a bit of After Burner, because of the general fast pace of gameplay.\n\nOverall, I'm very impressed with this game.  Works great with a Gamepad.  Controls are responsive, and the minimalist graphics give the game a very sharp and clean look.  The Dogfighting feels deliciously visceral, the Weapons are all useful in some way, there are a load of Aircraft available, and the AI is quite challenging.\n\nMy only real criticism at this point is the control scheme.  Generally, in most Flight Games, Guns and Missiles/Bombs are bound to two seperate buttons, because Missiles/Bombs are generally 'Primary' Weapons, while Guns are more 'Secondary' Weapons.  In Sky Rogue, all Weapons are bound to a single button, and are swapped between using another button.  This makes it awkward to switch between Guns and Missiles.  I'd recommend to the developers to adopt a system similar to the one I mentioned.\n\nI give this game a good thumbs up! :D", "timestamp_created": 1438376086, "timestamp_updated": 1438376086, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.617675", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "17322049": {"recommendationid": "17322049", "author": {"steamid": "76561198115351864", "num_games_owned": 43, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 660, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499554421}, "language": "english", "review": "--OLD REVIEW--\n\nGood gameplay, horrible menu. I understand the game came out yesterday, and that it is still in early access, but the menu is COMPLETELY unusable for someone attempting to play this game with a simple keyboard/mouse like me. The controls simply don't work. I can't go back, I can't get to the research part of the menu under loadout... Not to mention that the Aerolab in the campain menu doesn't work at all (It's all glitched out). One time when I started the game the letters were just a bunch of mutilated pixels. Another time I couldn't even start. I realize I haven't played this game long, but that's simply because the menus are unusable.\n\nNow actual gameplay? That's a different story. I absolutely LOVE it. The style, the sounds, and yes, even the anoying cheezy music. It's very well-made. I have a great time when I'm in the game, but in-between levels I have to fight with the menu so much that it drains the energy right out of the gameplay. I'm sorry, but I can't honestly give this game a thumbs-up with the horrid menu. \n\nFix the menu controls, and this game could very well be legendary material!\n\n[EDIT] I played this game again and looked up the menu controls. They still glitch pretty bad, but I understand the menu a little better. I think I was a little too harsh with my review. Thumbs up. Still, the implementation of mouse controls or at least fixing the keyboard ones would be a HUGE improvement. This game is incredibly addicting.\n\n[EDIT #2] It's fixed. Completely fixed. I love this game to bits now that everything works well.

Things like destroyed aircraft still being physical objects you can crash into and die as a result of, escalating threat level as you blow stuff up, both sky and land targets, the simple yet dynamic flight controls, the simple but engaging music, solid 60fps framerate by the looks of things, wonderful way of levelling up and unlocking stuff...\n\nSPLIT.\nSCREEN.\nMULTIPLAYER.\n\noh yeah you like that?

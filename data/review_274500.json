Story is lacking, but this game makes up for it in style and gameplay. \n\nWhile the campaign at first shoehorns you into only one loadout per mission, it branches out about 40% of the way through to allow you 3-4 different loadouts per level, each one changing the way you play drastically, from taking and dishing out massive ordnances, to hit-and-run tactics.\n\nThe game is best in the former as you're likely to get swarmed by large numbers of enemies. It never gets tiring firing a 140mm cannon into a large group of enemies. The visual feedback in this game is phenomenal. \n\nAs to what I didn't enjoy, the isometric angle also makes it difficult to tell exactly where your shot will land, leading to plenty of missed shots. \n\nThe limited ammo system can be hit-or-miss. It adds a lot of tension as you often have to pick your shots instead of simply spraying everywhere, which is a plus. However, if there are no enemy ammo drops to be had, your only recourse is to reload at ammo dumps. \n\nThis is no fun at all given that it has to be the RIGHT type of ammo dump, often ALL the way on the other side of the map AND it is easily blown up AND it has limited ammo. Even less fun if you have a slow, lumbering vehicle and there are a million obstacles in the way. Running out of ammo happened more often that I would have liked, and I feel I was already playing conservatively when possible. \n\nThankfully, there is a built-in infinite ammo cheat easily accessible through the developer console via F1. So these negatives are moot depending on how you want to play this game (namely if you just want to blow stuff up).

If you're interested in driving stompy robots buy Bragador.  If you like isometric shooters buy Bragador. If you like challenging yourself buy Bragador.   If none of those things are true or you want something casual to spend your time on there are better choices.  \n\nNow for the long version.  Brigador is an isometric vehicle shooter with both a campaign and freelance mode.  Either pays out money on successful mission completion which you use to unlock vehicles, weapons, special abilities, freelance missions, and lore.  The learning curve is relatively steep but managable, the tutorial missions at the start of the campaign are decent enough to learn the ropes.  The game can be quite difficult but that difficulty is always fair.  \n\nCampaign mode have fixed enemy spawns and a selection of 4 loadouts to bring to that mission.  Difficulty of campaign missions mostly ramps up with earlier missions being much easier and later missions being harder.  There is one curveball mission in the middle which probably rage inducing for some. The loadouts for each campaign mission tend to have a mix of reasonable and challenge loadouts.  \n\nFreelance mode is the meat of the game.  In it you choose a pilot which replaces the difficulty slider found in most games.  From there you select a vehicle, 2 weapons, special ability, and mission.  Freelance missions range from 2 maps to 30+ maps.  Individual maps have fixed layouts and psuedorandom enemy spawns.  Depending on the pilot, vehicle, and mission choices difficulty can range from cakewalk to 'I'm a skeleton in a golf cart, today the enemies will probably be exploding me for a change.' \n\nWeapons range from a lowly peashooter machine gun to city block leveling artillery with a huge range of weapons in between.  Almost every weapon has a niche that needs to be considered when choosing your loadout.  \n\nVehicles range from heavily armed nigh invincible supertanks to fast and agile but fragile agravs.   And a golf cart.  \n\nAll of the choices available for for freelance give a ton of replayability.  Different vehicles give a ton of variety, a Lowmill plays nothing like a Hoker.  Even within a vehicle different loadouts can play very differently, a Raider with Kraken, Pinch, and smoke, plays very differently from a Raider with Harvester, Donkey, and camo. \n\nLorewise the game is set on a dystopian colony world far distant from earth.  The lore entries, pilot descriptions, and weapon descriptions are all written from the perspective of characters in the universe.  Each has their biases and knowledge gaps.  Personally I've found the writing to be uniformly excellent.  It's one of the better crafted worlds I've come across in a game, to the extent that when a new patch comes out the first thing I check is to see if there are new lore entries to unlock.  \n\nIf the above sounds interesting buy Brigador it will be worth every penny once you have an idea what you're doing.", "timestamp_created": 1511868187, "timestamp_updated": 1511868187, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.652528", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37860594": {"recommendationid": "37860594", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040635142", "num_games_owned": 263, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1013, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 8, "last_played": 1514182365}, "language": "english", "review": "Brigador feels like a game that I missed in... 1995. A game where deaths feel like a collection of mistakes I can remember, not a game mechanic working against me. The music is great. The aestetic and graphics are great. The gameplay is great.\n\n\nBrigador is a game that has been lovingly crafted, and I do mean that. Looking at the game while it's running (in a high resolution anyway) may not key you in on how it's doing what it does, but the game is entirely 2D. Even with the massive amount of rendering space on screen at once on my 1920x1200 monitor, the game still runs over 200FPS, and never drops. It's not an unoptimized mess, and it still manages to have a lot of pretty features for those who want the most to look at out of their game (The aiming path is rendered to make the 2D look 3D, and there is a lot of dynamic lighting to do the same).\n\nWith Brigador's Campaign mode you'll have most of the game's learning curve explained to get you on to a plain where you may start to use any of the vehicles, weapons and defences you purchase effectively. The first 12 missions aid you in controlling a Mech, a Tank and an Agrav (Anti-Gravity, or [i]hovertank[/i], if you will). Controls are currently available to split between Agravs between Mechs and Tanks, and while some people want a unique control preset between Mechs and Tanks, if you aren't bothered by the same control scheme on both, you won't need to change it every time you want to use one or the other. Controls are available between forward being [b]Tile Absolute:[/b] north on the map (North being selectable as top left or top right), [b]Screen Absolute:[/b] north on the screen (always up, you control 45 degrees against the map's grid), and [b]Relative:[/b] forward is forward to the vehicle's heading (allowing you to hold W and D to walk in circles). Agrav controls are mostly the same except for [b]Relative[/b], where W will move the vehicle towards the cursor. Pressing A and D will still strafe relative to the vehicle's heading. This occurs mainly because a mech has heading of the legs, and the turret. The legs move, the turret does not. A tank has the heading of the treads and the turret. The treads move, the turret does not. An Agrav has the heading of a turret. The turret moves. If you've played Hotline Miami or are used to the way it handles movement, an Agrav might not feel too far off when played in [b]Screen Absolute[/b] mode. There are a few options for control toggles: mech crouching, orientation lock, and Agrav low-fly height. Players may also change gamespeed (the default is 80, and the slider goes up to 100, or down to 50); the ingame loadingscreen hints recommend changing it down \"if you use a controller or like seeing stuff explode in slow motion.\" I personally have left it at 80, but allowing people to change it is definitely a plus. Too bad you can't set it to 150% and play [i][b]Super Brigador Up-Armoured Turbo: Hyper Armored Combat[/b][/i].\n\nThe music is quite enjoyable, and I'd recommend the Deluxe edition from the start to save you a dollar (or two, depending on your currency) to get it's soundtrack (The Deluxe edition comes with an audio book and the soundtrack in MP3.) So far, my only complaint with the entire game is that the soundtrack isn't administered in FLAC. That's pretty impressive when you consider that I have no other problems.\n\nDo I think Brigador is worth your time? Absolutely. Brigador's gameplay allows you to jump in at just about any time after you've made some bank to choose what pilot, vehicle, weapons and defences you want and then a set of zones to just play whenever. Pilots dictate the game's difficulty and additional victory cash rewards, with some pilots ranging from easier difficulties, to a pilot who's difficulty is at max on the first map you will load on (each pilot has a Bio, and visible stats for difficulty and payout bonuses, regardless of wether you've bought them using ingame currency. There are no loot boxes, and no way to use real world money to get anything in this game).\n\n\n[b]tl;dr:[/b] Brigador, post Up-Armored relaunch, is quite possibly the second best game of 2016 to me, second only to Titanfall 2.

Highly recommended.\n\n\n-Pasted from a comment I made somewhere-\n\nAwesome graphics, if you're a fan of the sprite style.  Everything is so detailed, all the buildings, mechs, enemies, piles of rubble you leave behind and even the little civvies running around.  The lighting is great too.  The flash from the various guns and lasers, all the neon lighting around, and the frantic little flashlights that kick in when you scare the civilians.  It also interacts with the environment really well, the shadows from your vehicles lights look awesome on the rubble and grass and stuff.\n\nSound and music are great.  Guns, vehicles and explosions sound very powerful and punchy, the audio helps everything feel like it has weight to it.\n\nEverything is destructible.  For me this is more about seeing shit blow up in a battle than necessarily pathing through structures, which is slow and loud (but still fun)\n\n\n\nThe vehicles have 3 types, mechs, tanks, and anti-grav vehicles.  Within those three categories, there are a variety of sizes, with differing stats, weapon mount types and difficulty multipliers (more on that in a bit)\n\nThere are 3 factions that each have vehicles in those three styles.\nEach faction has visual differences and, if I remember right, faction specific stat tweaks.  Nothing game-changing, but one faction may favor shields over hull strength for instance.\n\nEach vehicle has a certain amount of hull strength, shields, and overcharge shield capacity.  Hull strength is just your hitpoints, can't remember if there's any way to replenish it (I don't think so).  Shields can be replenished, though they won't do it passively over time, but from pickups from destroyed enemies.  And overcharge is bonus shield capacity that deteriorates over time.\n\nEach vehicle has two weapon mounts, from types like auxiliary, main, heavy, small (and a few others I think), that determines what guns you get to pick from for your loadout.\n\n\n\nFor weapons there are ballistic weapons, lasers and mortars/artillery.  Ballistic and lasers have a few variations like cannon, chaingun, machine gun, shotgun etc., and artillery has varying sizes/ranges.\n\nIndividual weapons have different stats for things like shield damage, hull damage, fire rate, reload speed, structure damage, penetration, magazine size and total ammo pool.  Penetration is pretty neat, some of the big cannons can fire right through multiple structures.  Nothing like rear-shotting an enemy tank through a city block.\n\nYou also get to pick one of four or five special abilites, like smoke screen, cloaking, emp charge.  They have a cooldown, but unlimited use.\n\n\n\nI Haven't really played campaign at all, below mission info is about freelance/sandbox mode.\n\nYou start by picking an operation from the list.  Any op will always have the same maps and the same number of them.  So \"Operation Whatever\" will always take place on the drainage map, the slums and the canal for example, but the placement of objectives and enemies will be randomized.\n\nAside from taking place on different maps, each mission plays out the same.  You unlock the exit by doing at least one of the main objectives - kill a % of all enemies, kill all the commanders, or blow up all of the big artillery structures.

Everything from huge mechs and tanks with heavy artillery which can level a whole block with one shot to tiny powersuits with gamma lasers which can cook the enemy through walls and nippy agravs which can flit through enemy fire and circle around to attack their weaker rear armour, you can find a build for pretty much any playstyle you want. At higher difficulties with the smaller, more vulnerable units you really need to think ahead and take full advantage of your environment and equipment to survive.\n\nThe devs have done a fantastic job of supporting and extending the game despite it sadly not being a huge financial success for them, adding new levels and units and improving the graphics, with more to come in future updates.

I've been waiting for years for a game to have a theme like this and Brigador definitely delivers.\n\nThe gameplay is definitely not dated however. Controls are tight and responsive and the variety of mechs/vehicles, weapons, pilots, and missions is staggering to say the least. Many of the options feel very different from one another adding so much to the depth of the game. You'll definitely keep coming back to try new things for a long time.\n\nFinally I can't leave a review without mentioning the story.

Underneath there is a lot of customisation and a wide array of tactics you'll use to avoid an untimely demise.\n\nThe campaign mode has loads of missions, most with a choice of four loadouts.  These allow you to try to have a go at each scenario in very different ways.  Freelance mode allows you to set up your own vehilce and choose a set of missions.  There are three vehilce classes (tank, walker, agrav) which all handle in different ways and have significant pros and cons.  In each class there is a spectrum of sizes and the three factions each have their own strengths and weaknesses.\n\nThe difficulty in Freelance mode is entirely up to you, there are no easy/medium/hard settings.  Each pilot has a difficulty rating and many get harder as you progress through missions.  Certain vehicles and classes lend themselves to particular weaponry and each weapon has pros and cons.  Some maps are wide and open with lots of room to move but nowhere to hide, others are perfect for sneaking and setting up bottle-neck ambushes but with no room to turn and run.\n\nIts easy to learn in a big heavy tank, able to take a beating and dish out huge damage but you cant run or hide.  In some more difficult missions run and hide is the only thing which can keep you alive.  Projectiles take your vehilces momentum, making fast agravs exceptionally good artillery platorms.\n\nThe central theme of Brigador experimentation.

Whether you like being fast and nimble, a brawler, a sniper, the ol' bait-and-switch, or even stealth (yes, that's possible in a two story walking tank) there's a way to get what you want out of this game. Tons of chassis, tons of weapons, and 4 different special abilities that you can mix and match to make what you want.\n\nCampaign does a good job of teaching the basics and how the different vehicle types work, and then starts to ramp up the difficulty over time until by the end you feel like you got gud. There are also some interesting wrenches in the works here and there (Joy Bus/Hell Ride anyone?). It's nice that you can select from 4 premade loadouts; doesn't break the balance of the missions while giving you choices to suit your playstyle and also introducing a new player to the concept of building a loadout. (NOTE: I haven't played the new E-series so I can't vouch for that.)\n\nVery well done freelance mode lets you take things as slow and gentle as you want...or if you'd rather bend over and take it like a man, that's an option too. Build a loadout freely by picking a vehicle along with two weapons and a special ability and a pilot to go along with it. Then pick how many levels you want to run. The game determines how the difficulty scales based on which pilot you choose, as well as the payout, with the vehicle you choosing also providing bonus cash if you make it out. Precursor James Double Donkey runs are rumored to be the hot new thing but I haven't saved up the 100 million yet so don't ask me.\n\nMore subjective portion: I love this game's style and worldbuilding. Shots of all kind are distinct, the whole place has a sort of downtrodden industrial look to it and the color palette and art reflects that without compromising the gameplay (too much at least, see cons.) The backstory is great as well and the Lore section allowing you to read up on the game's world as told by its inhabitants is awesome.\n\nWhen you actually get into the game, the environment doesn't feel limiting or like a playing field, more so a tool you can use if you're clever enough. Pretty much all 4 special abilities tie into it at least indirectly and all vehicle classes have one way or another of smashing through groves of trees or apartment blocks. No need to walk down the street into a tank platoon, bust out from behind them two blocks down and hit them where it hurts most. Kool-Aid Man Simulator 2016.\n\nCons:\n\nSometimes I find it hard to tell whether a particular piece of scenery is explosive or not.

That identity is neon-soaked, synth-scored, vehicular mayhem. There's a ton of unlockables along with a good amount of lore if you care to read it, much of tinged with a dark sense of humor. But the real meat of the game is the all-single-player rampages you get sent on with your tank/mech/hovercraft across the cyberpunk planet of Solo Nobre.\n\nAlthough there are some light stealth elements and discretion is important at times, overall this is a game that wants you to fully enjoy making damn near everything in sight asplode with the incredible firepower at your disposal. Even just fighting off enemies will often result in extensive collateral damage to the environment. Which is fine, because this game basically tracks \"collateral damage\" as \"bonus points\".\n\nBeyond that, the \"Freelance\" mode offers quite a lot of customization, allowing you to combine whatever weapons with your chassis of choice before setting off for a string of missions. If you want a tiny, tracked motorcycle or battlesuit equipped with grenade launchers? No problem. A massive superheavy tank or hovercraft with a cloaking device? Done! It's all in there, waiting to be unlocked.\n\nOne last note: while some objections could still be made about the HUD, I think, (the icons are often rather small and hard to make out) the controls offer a satisfying amount of customization. If you're worried that you'll be stuck with a scheme you hate...don't sweat it too much. As long as twin-stick shooters in general are fun for you, you can likely find a setup that works for you in the options screen here.\n\nIf you're looking for something quiet, introspective, or with multiplayer then this isn't the game you want.

WELCOME, BRIGADOR. Back in the days we had these shooters Jungle Strike and Desert Strike with (nearly) completely destructible terrain. Then came Syndicate and Syndicate 2, both upping the ante with even more full blown orgy of destruction and endorsing the player to do massive collateral damage on one's wake. Then, on the whole different perspective we had wonderful Mech games in the forms of Mech Warrior series (well, about half of 'em were wonderful, at least) and Mech Commander. From this background comes Brigador, cherry-picks the best parts from its role models and brings us the terrible, beautiful wanton of destruction.\n\nOnly after few hours under my belt I already love it. It is both a tactical shooter and nearly limitless sandbox of destruction - like playing with a huge Lego set without assembly instructions and a ton of explosives. Brigador's slightly pixelish, neon light drenched and shadow blotted landscapes get constantly pulverized  under heavy mortar strikes, rip-roaring chainguns, rampaging tanks, stomping mechs, even hover-like flying platforms - and they all are designed in a delightfully wonky way that is completely implausible and yet very delightful, like something out of any 2000AD comic strip pages. \n\nThe game has a quite lengthy campaign dealing with procedurally 'liberating' the colony planet as a group of mercenaries doing it all for money (handsomely paid by a shady megacorporation). You use the cash to buy more drivers, vehicles, weapons, missions and (also very delightful) intel and lore for the mission mode, which I think is the real beef of the game. (Although I have enjoyed the campaign so far, too.) \n\nYou set up your death machine by selecting a hull from towering huge mechs or 'tanks' (more like an apartment block with guns on treads) or flying behemoths to relatively tiny ACPA suits, IFVs or flying platforms, and bolting on them your favored methods of destruction, and off you go. This gives lots of variety into how you plan to pull your job through - level everything with massive firepower, screw dodging and try to just soak the incoming damage with you shields and armour, or be the nimble little bastard that nobody can hit into and surgically strike your targets and dance away from the blasts before the enemy gets their cumbersome big hiney on the spot. Your imagination is the limit. \n\nBrigador hits my nerve perfectly with its payload of insane scale destruction, frantic shooty-action, tactical aspects and lovely old-skool visuals, not to mention the groovy retro-drenched Synthwave soundtrack pounding on the background. Cherry on the top, the lore is fun to read and gives names and faces on the odd looking things you're either driving yourself or blasting away with glee. Easy to get a grip on, simple enough to learn and time consuming to master with every aspect, Brigador reminds me of good old times - and that we have way too few good Mech games around.

If you so choose, however, the game's grimdark setting shines through narrative in the form of technical and personal descriptions displayed as notes written by characters in game, complete with a touch of dark humor that never feels out of place.\n\nI did not expect a game primarily about piloting mechs and blowing things up to have an incredibly rich, dark aesthetic. While not cyberpunk, it grips tightly to the same tone of a cold, cynical dystopia lit frequently by neon. The gritty style of the game's graphics is used to grand effect with cool-looking weapon effects and explosions. While it carries a certain oldschool feel, being set on an isometric plane, Brigador does not look or feel dated, partially due to its clever use of shaders.\n\nThe music, composed by Makeup and Vanity Set (MAVS), could singlehandedly give any best-of playlist put together by New Retrowave a run for its money. This reason alone should justify a purchase if you enjoy music like Perturbator, Carpenter Brut, Mega Drive, or Power Glove.\n\nThis game is good. It is quite possibly the peak of indie gaming.

Amazing synth soundtrack, beautiful isometric artstyle, and surprisingly deep and well written lore. However, I felt a bit mislead with the trailer. I expected a more visceral, lots of action and shooting all the time gameplay. Instead it's actually a very tactical and sometimes stealth driven which can actually be frustrating if you went in expecting otherwise. There's also a rather annoying gimmick level that raises a sudden roadblock while you're playing the campaign. Controls can feel a bit clunky too, tank controls just don't work well in a 2d isometric when you're trying to concentrate on so many little things on the screen. And they really don't give much ammo in some parts which ties into that tactical aspect they push. Often I found myself holding back and playing slow, which just became tedious rather than fun. Also you'll find the levels mostly boil down to the same thing, blow the things up and exit. Very 90s I guess, but repetitive. Repetition can be fun when it's mindless, but becomes a chore when having to be very careful about movement and ammo consumption, etc.\n\nOverall it's an alright game, not given enough recognition, but also overrated by some fans.

At its core, it\u2019s a simple sandbox game that has you ploughing through sectors and wasting enemies while completing objectives. The main campaign serves to get you comfortable to the various vehicular control schemes (mechs, tanks, and hovercrafts) and weapon types while sprinkling some lore in short text briefings before each mission. Once you finish that though (roughly 20+ levels), the real fun begins. The meat and potatoes of this game are in its FREELANCE mode, where you can totally customize your player before you go play a series of \u201csee how far you can go\u201d type missions. Choose your pilot, vehicle, weapon loadout, and mission environment. Every run earns you cash to spend on other variations of the elements I just mentioned.

In a nutshell the game takes place in a late 1980\u2019s early 90s esc cyber punk dystopian future where humanity has spread colonies amongst the stars. The game takes place in the city of Solo Nobre, a former corporate mega city turned Cuban esc regime by the efforts of Great Leader and his army the NEP. You as the player take the role of a \u201cBrigador\u201d essentially a mercenary hired by the corporations to accomplish various goals and wreaking as much havoc as possible within Solo Nobre during the chaos brought by great leader\u2019s assassination in exchange for cold hard cash.\n\n\tIn terms of gameplay brigador plays very much like the old SNES BattleTech top down mech shooter, albeit with a greater degree of polish. The player takes control of one of the various war machines in the game to accomplish their assigned goals and has a wide assortment of weaponry to do so. By completing missions and successfully extracting you earn cash which can be used to unlock various items in the game such as new pilots, vehicles, weapons, and lore documents. Brigador\u2019s gameplay is divided into two major parts the first being the campaign/story mode, in this mode the player must accomplish a series of missions using premade vehicle loadouts. Campaign missions can have a wide assortment of objectives but most boil down to eliminate the target then get out of the district. The second mode is free lance where players can select a pilot (difficulty level and payout multipliers), vehicle and its weapons, as well as what operation (series of levels) they wish to play. Every level will pit you against one of three factions, the NEP, the Corvids, and the Spacers. Each faction has their own vehicle sets (many of which you the player can actually use your self) and have different strengths and weaknesses though these are hardly noticeable when you start deploying with weapons that destroy entire city blocks in a single shot.\n\n\tIn terms of sound design and eye candy brigador achieves what its going for. The sprawling neon lit city scapes are fully realized in an isometric style reminiscent of command and conquer tiberian sun and dripping with just as much atmosphere. The game\u2019s soundtrack by Makeup and vanity set is simply fantastic and matches the visuals to the letter; I must point out however that the sound design for individual weapons and vehicles tends to rely on reusing sound assets though this is hardly noticeable in the grand scheme of things.\n\nBrigador\u2019s story and world building is perhaps the aspect I love the most about this game, every piece of equipment, vehicle, and pilot has back story detailed in various logs that take on different perspectives some of which going so far as to bring a bit of humor to what would otherwise be a bland lore document. The writing behind some of these logs is pretty clever and though not award winning materiel it certainly does add a bit of depth to what is otherwise just a top down shooter. \n\nI do thoroughly enjoy this game and would highly recommend it, but I can\u2019t help to see a few problems with it. The most glaring issue I see with the game is how repetitive it can get after a while, once you've completed every campaign mission you turn to freelance, but then it doesn't take long before you're running through the same city districts over and over again; the only real diversity coming from the vehicle and weapon set up your using as well as the possibility that you might be fighting a different faction this time around. A lack of any kind of multiplayer also kinda limits the game\u2019s replayability and effectively makes this a game I play when I have no one else to play with.

It lasts about 9 hours and is pretty fun.\n\nThe \"arcade\" mode, Freelance, lets you choose one of several dozen vehicles including hardsuits, mechs of varying sizes, hovercraft, and tanks. You can then equip it with any two weapons that can fit in the vehicles mountings, as well as taking a unique power such as laucnhing smoke grenades or firing a massively powerful audio pulse.\n\nFreelance will be the reason you come back to Brigador again and again. The different combinations you can create with each vehicle, pilot, weapon, and equipment make the game filled with potential. The small dev team also promises updates in the near future, but unfortunately, it's in Valve time.\n\nI'd recommend this game for sure.

Interessante mec\u00e2nica de combate, talvez lenta demais para o gosto de alguns, mas bem implementada. Alguns problemas parecem ter restringido um tanto o p\u00fablico. Brigador \u00e9 um jogo que n\u00e3o se compromete com narrativa, mas com a satisfa\u00e7\u00e3o de um combate dif\u00edcil em uma apresenta\u00e7\u00e3o retr\u00f4. Mas n\u00e3o \u00e9 um jogo para p\u00fablico diversificado e possui alguns problemas, al\u00e9m de um pre\u00e7o um tanto acima do que deveria ser.\n\nRecomendo com desconto a partir de 50%.\n\n-----------\n\nBrigador \u00e9 um \u00f3timo jogo em diversos aspectos. M\u00fasica \u00e9 excelente, sonoriza\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 muito boa. As cores vivas e o detalhamento do cen\u00e1rio em perspectiva isom\u00e9trica d\u00e3o ao jogo um visual retr\u00f4 e tornam a a\u00e7\u00e3o bastante peculiar.\n\nH\u00e1 um modo hist\u00f3ria com uma grande quantidade de miss\u00f5es para as quais voc\u00ea tem entre 1 e 3 ve\u00edculos dispon\u00edveis para fechar o cen\u00e1rio. Cada cen\u00e1rio demanda, basicamente, que o jogador destrua uma determinada quantidade de alvos espec\u00edficos e depois saia do cen\u00e1rio.\n\nH\u00e1 uma boa variedade de Mechs, ve\u00edculos e tamb\u00e9m pilotos (que possuem seus pr\u00f3prios atributos), ao lado de uma variedade de armas. Tudo pode ser destravado com pontos obtidos em modos arcade e campanha (uma esp\u00e9cie de tutorial). Cada ve\u00edculo e arma funcionam bastante diferente uns dos outros, dando incr\u00edvel relev\u00e2ncia mec\u00e2nica \u00e0s escolhas do jogador.\n\nO jogo possui uma tradu\u00e7\u00e3o razoavelmente bem revisada para Portugu\u00eas Brasileiro, mas n\u00e3o h\u00e1 muito para ser lido na parte da narrativa. N\u00e3o que n\u00e3o haja texto, mas o texto \u00e9 (tamb\u00e9m em vers\u00e3o original) desinteressante e pouco brilhante em rela\u00e7\u00e3o ao visual.\n\nPraticamente TUDO no cen\u00e1rio \u00e9 destrut\u00edvel, h\u00e1 boa quantidade de tipos diferentes de inimigos, mas nada que funcione como um BOSS ou chef\u00e3o. Dificuldade est\u00e1 relacionada aos tipos de t\u00e1ticas que o jogador deve adotar para cada tipo de inimigo e de acordo com a quantidade e inimigos acumulados ao redor.\n\nVoc\u00ea vai lembrar de todo e qualquer jogo do passado envolvendo mechs, ve\u00edculos armados e filmes de a\u00e7\u00e3o dos anos 90. E isso \u00e9 bastante para me deixar interessado, mas n\u00e3o \u00e9 o suficiente para fazer uma recomenda\u00e7\u00e3o a pre\u00e7o total.\n\nBrigador n\u00e3o \u00e9 bem um jogo para diversos p\u00fablicos. N\u00e3o \u00e9 r\u00e1pido nem simples o suficiente para quem gosta de twin stick shooters. O visual \u00e9 cheio demais de detalhes que prejudicam a percep\u00e7\u00e3o visual necess\u00e1ria para um jogo de a\u00e7\u00e3o t\u00e1tica (especialmente quando voc\u00ea acumula inimigos e precisa ajustar dist\u00e2ncia de disparo). \n\nVoc\u00ea pode imaginar que sistema ideal para controle \u00e9 um gamepad, mas o jogo parece ter sido feito principalmente com teclado e mouse em mente. O controle de dist\u00e2ncia da mira com uso dos sticks \u00e9 ineficiente. \u00c9 poss\u00edvel jogar com gamepad, mas melhor desempenho \u00e9 obtido com teclado e mouse.\n\nUma excelente apresenta\u00e7\u00e3o, mas com uma execu\u00e7\u00e3o muito restritiva. O jogo pode n\u00e3o prender voc\u00ea depois da terceira hora. Voc\u00ea sentir\u00e1 vontade de voltar a ele de vez em quando, mas n\u00e3o apenas a mec\u00e2nica cansativa, como tamb\u00e9m o visual cheio parecem n\u00e3o ser apropriados para longas sess\u00f5es.\n\nUm bonito e interessante jogo.

The soundtrack is great.\n\n- You can customize your mech/vehicle/hovercraft, and the options are good in freelance missions (I wish you could do \n   the same for campaign).\n\n- The atmosphere is really good, the feeling of strength of the weapons is conveyed really well, all in all you feel like you \n   are operating  a huge mech or a vehicle. There is no loss of that feeling by it being an isometric shooter.\n\n- Good controller support.\n\nCons:\n- The campaign is not long but it was fun.

I don't like pixel graphics, or 'trendy' indy crap. At the risk of being burned at the stake for heresy, I'm also not a fan of videogame music. What I do like are RPG's and mecha.\n\nThe screenshots for the game had me concerned that the game would be pixelated and look like old crap, fortunately actual gameplay looked a lot better than the screenshots suggest. The level of detail is excellent, and it's full 3D. They managed to give the game a retro look without deliberately forgoing modern advancements in technology. \n\nThe gameplay plays out in full 3d in spite of the flat terrain and isometric view. There is a degree of skill in controlling the elevation of flat trajectory shots. The balance of the game is also excellent. There is a lot to unlock, but nothing feels inaccessible or out of reach. See a mech you like? You can probably buy it after 2-4 missions. Buying a new mech, tank, or hovercar isn't so much about buying power as it is about buying a new playstyle, same with the weapons. If you want to be big and stompy with lots of armor and big guns, go right ahead. If you want to be fast and agile with mortars and strategic weapons using indirect tactics, go for it. It's not a matter of one being better, it's about which one you feel like doing at that moment. This means there is minimal grind to get the things you want, but a hefty time investment to unlock everything, so lots of content without the boredom. The destructible terrain is great, it gives the feeling of mass destruction and mayhem. You feel powerful, but not indestructible.\n\nAs for complaints, it's easy to get turned around with tanks and mechs so you're walking backwards exposing your rear armor, and difficult and time consuming to set it straight again. Important information about weapons isn't displayed in the store before buying. Will they fire directly or are they mortars? Do they fire single shot, burst , or full auto? You have to buy to find out. Fortunately buying them isn't too expensive depending on the class, and they follow a repeating pattern in their order, at least for type. The menu, while functional, is clunky, this was a stylistic choice to maintain the retro 90's arcade aesthetic, so it's more a matter of opinion. Also, purely a matter of preference, it's light on the RPG elements. It's not advertised as an RPG, it just would have been more enjoyable to me personally if it were. More in depth vehicle customization would have also been nice, but wouldn't really work with their current direction of quick action. This is, again, a matter of preference, some people, like myself, enjoy pouring over builds and getting involved with management level meta, other people just want to get into the action and play, this game caters to the latter.\n\nTo summarize, in many ways this game isn't what I normally prefer, but it is an excellent well-crafted game.

Why?\nBecause all you have to do is destroy 1 target by 1, therefore leeching on their shields, and you can keep soaking damage even with a light vehicle.\nTherefore the game is too easy and you can steamroll the enemy.\n\nTherefore all the mechanics about using flanking, EMP granades, smoke screens, cover mechanics and such are mostly garbage.\n\nIt's supposed to be as a stealth game because the objectives spread across a huge map (that is also boring to cross to gather them all).\nWhy would have that in a battle game? You could just steamroll the enemy and then gather the objectives in the (now) ghost city. There would be no reason to spread them! But you're supposed to sneak past their formations or at least try to flank them. But you won't. You'll just steamroll them and then spend 10 minutes to cross the entire city and gather them.\n\nIt is a stealth game because of the above: the campaign clearly hints on how you're supposed to \"Swat the enemy\": you're supposed to flank their formation, toss in a EMP granade, dinamic entry by diving trough a building with your fullspeed tank, and wipe out the enemy squad.\nProblem is, nothing of that is necessary (and the tanks are either too slow or too light to pierce themselves trough buildings...)\n\nIf it was not so easy, so dammn easy, all of it could make some sense.", "timestamp_created": 1503536027, "timestamp_updated": 1503536248, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.379223", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34424357": {"recommendationid": "34424357", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061442051", "num_games_owned": 197, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 239, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503436535}, "language": "english", "review": "I really wanted to like this game.

But with all that gear, you can pick and choose how you want to play. Stealth, guns blazing, or a mix is all possible with none of the weapons seeming overpowered or underpowered. And everything you see ingame is a thing you can take and use.\n\nThe only negative I've found was the control scheme, which doesn't always work well with every vehicle.

Everything can be made to be the way you enjoy it the best while at the same time offering you challenges exactly the way you want them.

Those games and their gameplay were some of my favorite on my Sega Genesis as a kid.  While Brigador isn\u2019t exactly like those games, it gave me just enough of a nostalgia trip to really get in to it and enjoy it's hearty gameplay.\n\n[h1]Who is your Brigador and what does he do?[/h1]\n\nBrigador: Up-Armored Edition is an updated version of the original game released in June of 2016 after eight months in Early Access.  The re-released update dropped in June of 2017 and added some missions to the campaign, updated the graphics, and did some rebalancing.  I had the pleasure of playing both since I got the game just before this update.  I can say that it is more appealing now than it was before, though even with the balance changes there can be some rough difficulty spikes that you will come across.  The core of the gameplay in the campaign is relatively simple.  You\u2019ll grab one of the next missions in the group you\u2019ve unlocked (usually three or four at a time), perhaps read the gist of what you\u2019ll be doing and why, select one of the four pre-established vehicles, and head in to blow up nearly everything in sight.  The vehicles come in a large variety.  There are tanks and wheeled vehicles, hovertanks, and bipedal mechs, all of which range in size from tiny you lose them on screen to fairly larger and slow to maneuver.  These are each outfitted with a unique loadout of weapons and abilities that can be better or worse suited for the type of missions you encounter.  However, the campaign is designed to have you replay missions as many times as you want and receive marks for beating it in each provided vehicle.  Going through it the first time I gravitated toward the larger and more heavily armed and armored vehicles in most situations because that\u2019s the playstyle I like, however I could see how the faster and more stealthy vehicles could work very well too if you practiced with them.\n\nOnce in the mission, you\u2019ll have a list of your objectives in the top corner and little else guiding you through except some icons along the edges of you screen indicating the direction of the objectives.  You can move through at your own pace on your own path, or just carve it out of the destructible level.  Vehicles and buildings will crumble and explode at the whim of your mouse clicks.  Enemies vary just as much as your choice in vehicles from small and super-fast to much larger than anything you can pilot and equally slow.  Their firepower can be just as diverse.  Dispatching them may take a sweep of your machine gun or have you running around dodging their shots as you pick them apart.  Objectives are simple at best, usually requiring you to either blow up certain buildings or special vehicles, or just wiping out 70% of the enemies on the map (and sometimes both).  However, the unique design of each map makes it much less repetitive than such a limited set of objectives would indicate.  Plus, the real challenge comes to the surface when you have to manage both the health of your vehicle along with its  ammo that runs out several times a mission, requiring you to salvage ammo pickups from not-completely-destroyed enemies or finding the handful of ammo depots with limited supply.  The raw carnage and combination of action and tactical efforts from the player really define the beginning and end of what makes Brigador so fun.\n\n[h1]What else is going on?[/h1]\n\nWell, there\u2019s a metric ton of story lore in the game.  There\u2019s a tiny bit presented in the campaign, but the majority is unlocked via the money that you earn for each mission.  This money has no effect on the campaign itself as far as I can tell, but you earn a great deal going through the missions.  You can spend it on unlocking tons of in-game content including vehicle and enemy descriptions, story elements of all sorts including information about the factions involved, freelance mission items that include vehicles, vehicle pilots with varying mission modifiers, and equipment for those vehicles.  This leaves a pretty robust amount of gameplay even after you finish the campaign that, if you wanted to complete fully with all vehicles would take many hours beyond the four-plus I used to run through it once each.  The lore and descriptions you can unlock weave a giant web of story content that is entirely optional to the player, but it seems to be something the developers put a lot of effort in to.  There\u2019s even an audio book included with the Deluxe edition, which I think I received just for having the game before it re-released.  Also included in that Deluxe edition is a great soundtrack of perfectly crafted synthwave music that meshes with the explosive gameplay surprisingly well.  It\u2019s very prominent, so if it\u2019s not a type of music you\u2019re in to, you\u2019re going to have to turn it off entirely.  However, for me it was great and I left its pumping beats and 80s aesthetic going strong the whole way through.\n\n[h1]So did anything suck?[/h1]\n\nThere were a few smaller issues and some larger ones that really had me drinking the rageahol.  The health system in Brigador has you maintaining both your standard health and a shield that can be recharged by enemy drops.  However, your normal health can\u2019t be fixed by anything in a mission.  This isn\u2019t a problem in most missions that are relatively short an simple, but some missions are a bit longer and any encounter with a lot of enemies can wear your non-reparable health down, making a small mistake force you to restart.  On top of that, shield drops disappear after a period.  This means that if you\u2019re working with long range weapons or slow moving vehicles, a large firefight may have you missing out on the lifeblood you need to keep going.  Another small issue is that you have to learn about the environments in a bit of a trial by fire.  Some buildings will explode killing you instantly if you run into them or destroy them from too close.  It can be difficult to distinguish these and result in an unexpected and frustrating death.  They could easily be marked in an more obvious way, but they often blend in too well.  The most annoying thing I encountered was the difficulty spikes.  Some missions would be many times harder than missions before or after.  I played through one probably 15 or 20 times as it had you starting with no ammo and dodging insta-kill suicide enemies to get to the ammo depots.  In addition, the final optional campaign mission is significantly longer than previous ones and trying to maintain health during it is nearly impossible with what vehicles are supplied.  If this is the rebalanced version, I\u2019d hate to have seen what some of these later missions were like before that.\n\n[h1]Recommendation?[/h1]\n\nThis really is a good game and I would suggest getting it for $10 or less as it has been (and currently is on GOG) under that price.  While it may lack some of the things that I really enjoyed about those old Strike games, it does have some solid mechanics that the player can improve and master throughout the tons of replayability provided.

I believe if you play the entire campaign, you can get enough dough to buy some of the best available. \n\nIn freelance, you can buy a pilot, a vehicle, weapons and missions (and lore; intel but w/e)\nHere's one of the brilliant part of the game.. The biggest, baddest vehicles are worth the least and the smallest, weakest vehicles are worth the most. Why? Because each vehicle has a payout modifier, wanna make it hard on yourself but earn three times more than anyone else? Use the tiniest vehicle. Wanna wreck havoc or get through a long and hard series of missions? Use a big bad vehicle and tear the place apart.\n\nPilots also get to have such modifiers but I first need to explain missions (Operations as they are called in-game).\nOperations are basically a series of missions, smallest being a series of 2 but can get up to a whopping 39!\nYou have to be careful though, as your vehicle does not repair itself nor rearm itself between missions.\nDuring each missions, you have a set of main objectives and a set of optional objectives (They're all about killing and destruction). You can end the current mission after completing at least one main objective, or you can stay and complete the level to gain more money. As you finish the entire operation, the money you've earned will be multiplied by some factors, such as the type of vehicle and pilot you've used.\n\nAnd that brings us to the pilots. \nHere's what the pilot named \"Phil Bromlin\" has for stats:\n\n[table]\n[tr]\n[th]Stat[/th]\n[th]Value[/th]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td]Start Difficulty[/td]\n[td]1[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td]Max Difficulty[/td]\n[td]7[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td]Increase per Level[/td]\n[td]0.50[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td]Victory Bonus[/td]\n[td]$25'000[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td]Min Payout Multiplier[/td]\n[td]1.0[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td]Max Payout Multiplier[/td]\n[td]2.6[/td]\n[/tr]\n[/table]\n\nLet's say you're playing an operation that has 5 districts(missions).\nThe difficulty and the payout multiplier will grow by 0.50 per district.\nMeaning by the fifth mission, you'll be at 3 difficulty level and 2.6 of payout (since it's the max).\n\nSo you really want to buy better pilots and better operations, so you can make more money and eventually try to beat the hardest missions the game can throw at you.\nThere's 38 pilots to hire, 63 vehicles and 44 weapons to purchase.\nThe vehicles are divided by 3 factions (Loyalist, Corvid, Spacer) and 3 vehicle types (Mech, Tank, Agrav(floating vehicles)).\nBeyond that, you'll have to see for yourself.", "timestamp_created": 1502630228, "timestamp_updated": 1502634033, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34205469": {"recommendationid": "34205469", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038345483", "num_games_owned": 226, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1577, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 40, "last_played": 1514272207}, "language": "english", "review": "What this game may lack in cohesive storyline or compelling characters, it makes up for in pure, unbridled, destructive mayhem.\n\nWhile this game may not be \"compelling\", what it is, is great fun.\n\nLiberate Solo Nobre.\nDestroy your enemies.", "timestamp_created": 1502596053, "timestamp_updated": 1502596053, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34194271": {"recommendationid": "34194271", "author": {"steamid": "76561197976417707", "num_games_owned": 446, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 184, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502553022}, "language": "english", "review": "Explosions kill it.

Brigador versucht sich im rauhen Alltag des S\u00f6ldner-\"Mechpiloten\", wobei es auch eine ganze Reihe anderer Fahrzeugtypen gibt.

In einiger Hinsicht zeigt das Spiel in meinen Augen gewisse Story/Atmosph\u00e4re-Schw\u00e4chen: Es fehlt mir an Story, an Zwischensequenzen, an \"lebendiger\" Hintergrundwelt. Es spielt sich meiner Ansicht nach daher etwas \"blutleer\" bzw. \"trocken\".

Die Effekte sehen anst\u00e4ndig aus, die Level mit den Geb\u00e4uden, Fahrzeugen und Zivilisten erinnern vage an den Klassiker Syndicate. Einige Punkte in dem Spiel finde ich \u00fcbertrieben bzw. sinnlos wie die Auswertung mit der Zerst\u00f6rung und den Opferzahlen.

There's no denying the sound, art, writing come together as a cohesive whole. But as a piece of design, as a game meant to be played, it leaves a lot to be desired.\n\nI played long enough to beat the campaign and to give the more open-ended Freelance mode a couple whirls, and I kept waiting for the game to hook me. I tried playing with the biggest mechs with the best weapons and destroying everything in sight. I tried playing with the smaller vehicles, ones that required more strategy and were more difficult. I tried completing every side objective on a map. I tried speed-running through them instead. Didn't matter. The game never felt compelling. It never felt more than a superficial, mildly entertaining romp through rectangular districts that mostly look the same.\n\nThere's a lot of design approaches a game can take to hook the player and while Brigador dabbles in some of them, none of them were implemented well enough to draw me in:\n\n-A game can hook by providing interesting characters with character arcs (like the Telltale Games). There are no characters in Brigador and certainly no character arcs.\n\n-A game can hook by providing an interesting plot / environment with mysteries to uncover (like Bioshock). The plot here is paper-thin. You get summaries before each mission, but they're only providing an explanation of the objectives. Basically you're a mercenary who blows stuff up because some text told you to. There's no sense of progress, no meaningful advancement of story.\n\n-A game can hook by providing a meaningful challenge (like Dark Souls). Difficulty in Brigador is problematic, as it primarily comes from willfully choosing poor tools for the job. For example, in a given campaign map, you can choose a massive mech with double lasers that can take a lot of punishment or you can choose a tiny sniper mech that is easily destroyed. Some people enjoy this - and I think these people may appreciate the options Brigador provides. I do not. I love difficulty - but I love difficulty that the game provides, not that I must generate by willfully making poor choices or placing arbitrary restrictions on myself.\n\n-A game can hook by providing stat / gear / unlock progression (like Diablo 3). Brigador's open-ended Freelance method provides an extensive list of things to unlock, including new weapons, mechs, & pilots. While the pilots represent difficulty options and don't otherwise affect gameplay, the weapons all felt unique and interesting, an excellent feat given how many there are. Unfortunately, the campaign has NO progression. For each map, you're provided a couple pre-made loadouts and that's that.\n\n-A game can hook by providing exploratory elements, such as new environments, hidden collectibles, bigger and scarier opponents, etc. There is some variety in the level design - rural vs. junk city vs. regular city - but none of it ever really *pops.* Same with unit design. You do eventually encounter some larger mechs but it's genuinely kind of hard to tell the difference because the game is so dark and zoomed out. It desperately needed paint jobs, decals, etc on the mechs, to distinguish them from each other. Even the three factions are remarkably similar. Furthermore, there are no hidden collectibles, no secret bosses, none of that. In fact, there are no bosses at all, which seems a wasted opportunity.\n\nUltimately, the game isn't compelling. This is unfortunate as it clearly has some excellent elements. I personally would love to play a Brigador 2 that bothered to create a compelling story with interesting characters; with levels that had unique & clear design (rather than the randomly generated feel they all have now); with an intelligent progression from small mechs and weak weapons to large mechs and powerful weapons. Maybe even some multiplayer elements, like horde defense co-op, CTF, etc. That game would be frikkin awesome.

You can completely customise the difficulty. Want to destroy everything with a giant mech with overpowered weapons? You can do that. Or you can take a medium mech and have to be more tactical. Or you can take a tiny antigrav tank and zip around. Or you can fight in a paper armoured battle suit. It's incredibly customisable.\n\n2.)  The combat is simple, but incredibly fun. You only have 2 weapons and a special ability, but the massive amount of different weapon types means that every single round can play differently.\n\n3.) Incredible value for money. For a single player game, you can sink hours and hours into it. Reminds me of the game FTL in that way, where you can just keep playing for ages.

Everything is destructable except for the outer walls, with weapons or by just crushing it underfoot. There's a variety of vehicles and weapons from different kinds of machine guns to heavy cannons to gauss rifles and lasers - even artillery, rockets and acid canisters. You can pilot (almost) every vehicle in the game including mechs, ground vehicles and antigravity vehicles.\n\nAt first I wasn't too impressed by Brigador - sure, the campaign missions were a bit fun if a little too challenging, but after getting through them all I just didn't feel like the game was worth it... Then I tried freelance and it was horribly boring because it was too easy -  I didn't understand how to buy things, pilot difficulty or how map progression worked. After buying a difficult pilot, some good gear/vehicles and a decently long (5) mapset I now totally get it and it's fun!\n\nThe customization is simple but kind of neat. All the weapons in the game have a class like \"heavy\" \"main\" \"turret\" or \"small\". Ammo used is independent of type. Every vehicle gets exactly two mounts of these kinds in addition to varying movement and durablility. So customization is a matter of: pick pilot - pick vehicle - pick 1st weapon - pick 2nd weapon - pick defensive system - go. It's very simple but with tons of different combinations, which I appreciate.\n\nI can't resist comparing freelance mode to a roguelike even though it totally isn't one. You have to complete at least one objective on every map before you can exit to the next one. Your health and ammo carry over. Eventually you can extract at the spaceport, and you only get a good payout if you survive.

In Campign mode, these are chosen for you, but you can choose your own loadout in Freelance mode. Different weapons behave differently against buildings, enemy shields and hull, and different vehicles behave differently to enemy fire and terrain types. This gives the player some things to consider both when choosing their loadout or making tactical decissions in battle. The game is more tactical than anything, since choosing in what order you deal with enemies, how you position yourself, and when you use your active ability is more important to survival than how you use your weapons. Weapons, however, do behave differently mechanically, some weapons have travel speed and others are more of \"hitscan\" weapons, most shoot in a straight line down to the ground, but others fire like a shotgun spread, or even high-arch projectiles.\n6/10 - Good\n\n== AESTHETICS (The audiovisual presentation of the game) ==\nIf you've heard about this game before, you must have heard about the soundtrack. Have the studio chosen some usual orchestral or rock music, the game could've felt cheap and uninteresting. The original synthwave soundtrack by one of the best artists in the genere, Makeup and Vanity Set (and some others since the Up-Armored update) ultimately gives the game a unique ambient and soul. The graphics are a love letter to 90s to early 2000s isometric sci-fi games. The player and enemy vehicles are 2D sprites with 64 different angles pre-rendered from 3D models with normal maps cooked in for interaction with the game's lighting effects, which give the finishing touch to the cyberpunk setting of the game. The game easily runs at 60FPS, but the pre-made animations for mechs and enemies have a very low ammount of frames. This deliberate choice, along with the semi-uncanny valley illustrations for pilot portraits, give off a very classic and somewhat unsettling feeling to the game, similar to some of Scott Cawthon's (creator of FNAF) earlier works (see: The Desolate Hope).\n10/10 - Masterpiece\n\n== CHALLENGE (The thought put into the challenges the game gives to the player) ==\nThe game gives a lot of opportunity for the player to tweak the difficulty of the game. First, the game speed setting: the player is allowed to change the speed of both themselves and the enemies (from 50% to 100% speed, set to 80% by default). Then there's the pilots: as the player progresses, they can unlock new pilots, and each of them is essentially a different combination of payout and difficulty modifiers, form one that makes it so that no enemies will ever spawn to get only a tenth of the pay, to pilots locked into the highest difficulties at all times in exchange for some big buck, even ones that will start at a low difficulty and gradually increase for each sector cleared, a sector being one of the different levels in each mission. Loadout choice also goes into play: some weapons have a low ammo capacity but deal very high damage (like lasers and explosives), others have a high ammo capacity and high fire rate in exchange for low damage per bullet (like gatling guns and turret guns), which can make ammo management (a very important part of the game) easier. Finally there's vehicle choice: bigger vehicles are louder, but more resilient, while smaller ones are more silent, but fragile. Each vehicle has a different combination of factors to consider: movement speed, movement acceleration, aiming speed, turning speed, hull, shields, temporary shields (an extra shield that fades out over time), etc. Some vehicles are even at a direct disadvantage to others or pose a higher risk to the player, but compensate it by giving an extra payout when the mission is done. It's a big mish-mash of ways to tweak the game to your liking.\nPerfect - 9/10\n\n== FINAL SCORE ==\n8/10 - Excellent", "timestamp_created": 1499366692, "timestamp_updated": 1511399014, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.474453", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33300417": {"recommendationid": "33300417", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996587952", "num_games_owned": 110, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 243, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499276133}, "language": "english", "review": "Wow, I don't really understand the critical acclaim that comes with this game.

I came to the game with the expectation of giant stompy robots, but it ended up being a general vehicular mayhem simulator of the highest degree. A large campaign acts as a delivery mechanism for training and challenge missions, but the Freelance mode offers you large, open-ended \"runs\" to test your mettle with whatever configurations you can cook up, and is arguably the more compelling game mode once you have the basics down.\n\nIt's a skill-based game - weapons have distinct firing arcs based on their properties and where they're mounted on your vehicle as well as different colour-coded ammo types, and vehicle facing is important to mitigate how much damage you take. The controls are nonetheless simple enough to get the hang of with a bit of training, but learning to operate vehicles with finesse will take time and practice (which is exactly what I'm looking for in this sort of game).\n\nSpecial note of the fact that once you're on a map, the game lets go of your hand and you're on your own. Brigador presents your objectives, and its up to you *how* you complete them, or whether you can complete them at all. Several side-objectives let you influence the map in interesting ways too (as well as earning more filthy lucre). Coming up with priorities for what objectives you can actually afford to complete (or end up HAVING to complete due to your actions) lends a nice layer of strategy to what would otherwise be frivolous stompenshoot. The fact that you can destroy literally anything on the map to carve your own path through is not only fun, but useful given the open-ended nature of the maps.\n\nTwo minor complaints would be that it's not always terribly clear when you're taking damage or where from, and your firing arcs don't indicate when they're obstructed by terrain, meaning that you may inadvertently waste a lot of ammo demolishing walls instead of your foes. It's also not always clear which Freelance runs you've previously completed. These are minor issues, though, and don't overwhelmingly detract from the game.\n\nIf any of this sounds appealing, buy this game.", "timestamp_created": 1498984779, "timestamp_updated": 1498984929, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.607136", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33115565": {"recommendationid": "33115565", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014827224", "num_games_owned": 327, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 882, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509091967}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazingly pure top down mech/tank/hover-tank smash 'em up.", "timestamp_created": 1498972685, "timestamp_updated": 1498972685, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493653", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33107578": {"recommendationid": "33107578", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083982976", "num_games_owned": 143, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 168, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509061742}, "language": "english", "review": "Better than I expected.

It has great atmoshpere, thanks to the amazing soundtrack (which comes included in the Up-Armored Edition, highly recommended if you're into John Carpenter's music), the cyberpunkish theme, story and the presentation in general (the naming of things like vehicles and weapons and the story together are just fucking cool). \nThe controls are tight, there's tons and tons of variability of the difficulty and the gameplay, thanks to different pilots, vehicles and weapons that you can unlock. It's worth mentioning that the game also has all the options to need to customize the way you want it to play, going as far as different settings for different kind of types of vehicles, setting the game's speed and support for controllers. There's plenty of content to support the customizability, there's different types of weapons, vehicles and many-many levels to try out. You can also randomize your loadout. For example, you can get a giant heavy mech with a big ass artillery gun that levels whole city blocks with a single shot or get a tiny hoverbike that you can use to zip around the enemy if you're crazy enough.\nSpeaking of trying stuff out, the campaign is a must play and not just because the first couple of levels are the tutorials about the game's mechanics. It ramps up nicely and introduces new stuff step-by-step and most importantly after the tutorial levels end, you have the ability to choose from 3 or 4 types of predefined vehicles to play the levels through, which helped me to discover fun combinations to play with in freelance mode.\nAnd the freelance mode is where it gets a bit weak for me, but only because I dislike rougelikes. In both the campaign and freelance mode you play to earn more money to unlock more weapons, vehicles, pilots, levels and some lore about units and other stuff. So you do the same objectives over and over again on the levels to earn money to do it all over again, now with the stuff you unlocked. As I mention before there are tons and tons of stuff to unlock and the customizability of those unlocked stuff is more than you would ever want, the core gameplay is still the same. Enter the level, accomplish the same objectives by blowing them up and then exit the level. As much as I dislike rougelites (rougelikes even more), for me the presentation of the game made up for the repetitive natur of the game.

However, it is so much more beautiful than any of those games ever were. Just looking at the environments and mechs is a treat for me. There's some nice lighting that doesn't really affect gameplay, but it sure sets the right mood and has some nice light/dark contrasts. In addition, the game doesn't stutter for no reason like I've found some other smaller titles tend to do. \n\nEverything is destructible! Well, except for the level bounds. But everything can be reduced to a pile of rubble, and some vehicles can even use it as cover. (This surprised me.) This allows for some pretty interesting tactics, such as giant mechs crouching down to gain more protection and tiny mechs extending upwards to fire over things. You can have some ace pilot moments if you're getting swamped by enemies in urban areas, as every object has verticality and can block enemy line of sight on you, allowing you to flank a blob of enemies. (Or you can just shoot them through a high-rise with a railgun.)\n\nControls can feel slightly unresponsive, depending on which vehicles you're using, but it's a system to be mastered. Some vehicles move faster, have better turn radii, but when you get used to the slower ones, it's an absolute joy to perfectly swing your Abbot cannon around and peg an AGRAV zipping around you.\n\nThe soundtrack is about 50% of what's great about this game. The quality of the music can really make or break movies and games. Brigador's soundtrack makes the game. \n\nThe only true complaint I have is that most of the pilot portraits are fugly. I never realized so many mercenaries were related to potatoes. Some of the potraits look a little off, can't quite put my finger on why.\n\nOverall, I think this game is going to go down as a classic and I hope that Stellar Jockeys goes on to create more games matching this one's caliber.

Unos d\u00edas despu\u00e9s de a\u00f1adirlo a mi librer\u00eda, empec\u00e9 a notar m\u00e1s titulares que hablaban del juego, de sus desarrolladores y el cambio de su suerte. Seg\u00fan la historia, Brigador es un proyecto que se neg\u00f3 a la tentaci\u00f3n del kickstarter y despu\u00e9s de varios a\u00f1os de desarrollo, logr\u00f3 la mayor\u00eda de sus prop\u00f3sitos; creo que el equipo de Stellar Jockeys hizo bien y que fueron sensatos, cautelosos, porque si no luego pasan cosas extra\u00f1as como con Chroma Squad.\n\nSin embargo, no lo niego, la apuesta fue demasiado arriesgada. Supongo que todav\u00eda lo es. Pocos juegos tienen desarrollos tan aventurados y felices como este.\n\nBrigador es un juego de sprites isom\u00e9trico donde rentas a tu piloto a una organizaci\u00f3n anarquista y manejas mechas, veh\u00edculos y tanques para destruir las ciudades de un gobierno autoritario. Hay una historia ah\u00ed, pero se construye a base de pocas certezas, bastantes rumores, sin dejar descansar al humor negro y la iron\u00eda, lo cual, personalmente, me parece un deleite. La mayor\u00eda de los pilotos son mercenarios y tiene un trasfondo entre tr\u00e1gico y c\u00ednico.\n\nEstos peque\u00f1os fragmentos de historia van acorde con el entorno cyberpunk del juego y engalanan, dan una profundidad sabros\u00edsima, a las ilustraciones de los pilotos (quienes asombran y hacen re\u00edr, o sonre\u00edr, porque mis preferidos son los que parecen luchadores de bar, aquellos que beben una chelita de m\u00e1s y malacopean para pronto entrarle a los madrazos). Al juego lo acompa\u00f1a m\u00fasica de sintetizadores muy ochentera; \u00bfestamos cansados de este renacimiento de los ochenta el cual parece no tiene llenadera? Para nada, Brigador lo hace muy bien.\n\nEn cuanto al juego, puedes usar mouse y teclado o gamepad. Sospecho que el mouse y teclado son mejores, o m\u00e1s pr\u00e1cticos, para Brigador pero eventualmente logr\u00e9 configurar mi dual shock 4 para jugarlo c\u00f3modamente (importante: tienes que moverle a la configuraci\u00f3n hasta que quede, si no, te frustrar\u00e1s mucho).\n\nHay tres tipos de veh\u00edculos y cada uno tiene diversas opciones a configurar (armas y especiales): los mechas, autom\u00f3viles y tanques, dependiendo de su tama\u00f1o y su movilidad, son m\u00e1s robustos o m\u00e1s \u00e1giles, o quiz\u00e1s son tan d\u00e9biles que son especiales para situaciones de sigilo y demandan juegos mejor planeados y estrat\u00e9gicos. Los desarrolladores no escatimaron recursos para probar diferentes tipos de veh\u00edculos y complacer a jugadores de distintos estilos de juego. Hay un modo campa\u00f1a el cu\u00e1l es de pilotos fijos y tiene entre tres o cuatro dificultades (o modos de juego, dependiendo), o bien, puedes jugar al freelancer y armar una serie de mapas continuos para probar una configuraci\u00f3n personal y ver hasta d\u00f3nde puedes llegar antes de morir o de llevarte el bot\u00edn gordo.\n\nEl modo Freelancer es donde brilla el juego y donde pasar\u00e1s m\u00e1s tiempo. En ambos modos, tanto la campa\u00f1a como en el freelancing, los pilotos ganan y acumulan dinero que utilizar\u00e1s para comprar m\u00e1s opciones: mapas, veh\u00edculos, pilotos, fragmentos de la historia o estrategias (un bestiario con los veh\u00edculos y las cosas que destruyes). Cada cosa, seg\u00fan la configuras, modifica este modo de juego. Los mapas, por ejemplo, entre m\u00e1s dinero inviertes en ellos, abren m\u00e1s zonas y secuencias a visitar. Los pilotos y los veh\u00edculos modifican la dificultad del mapa por cada zona vencida adem\u00e1s de alterar el multiplicador de dinero. Por supuesto, puedes configurar este modo para escoger todos los atributos del azar y que esto sea una sorpresa o bien, puedes buscar y perfeccionar a tu Brigador con una configuraci\u00f3n que te permita pasar las zonas m\u00e1s altas. Hay tantas combinaciones posibles que hay Brigador para rato.\n\nOjo: algunos veh\u00edculos, claro, est\u00e1n dise\u00f1ados para ser verdaderas m\u00e1quinas de la muerte, no s\u00f3lo para los habitantes de Solo Nobre (el planeta que est\u00e1s liberando) pero tambi\u00e9n para los propios pilotos. Entre m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil de manejar sean los veh\u00edculos, m\u00e1s altos son los multiplicadores de dinero.\n\nEl dise\u00f1o del juego me recuerda, brevemente, a un juego isom\u00e9trico que jugu\u00e9 alguna vez: Syndicate. O quiz\u00e1s el primer\u00edsimo de los pr\u00edncipes de Persia. S\u00ed, bueno, pero actualizado a una calidad de 1080p. Las animaciones son fluidas, demasiado bien cuidadas, se nota un trabajo obsesivo, art\u00edstico. Reconocer\u00e1s un placer extra\u00f1o en apreciar los movimientos de los peque\u00f1os hombrecillo de gabardina amarilla a los que aplastas. Es palpable el esfuerzo por dar profundidad y dise\u00f1o a los veh\u00edculos y sus texturas. Los escenarios y edificios recuerdan a los settings de otras obras cyberpunk o dist\u00f3picas como Blade Runner, Akira o Max Headroom. Pero no s\u00f3lo hay parques industriales, sucios, pero tambi\u00e9n hay suburbios y zonas de cultivo que contrastan perfectamente con lo anteriormente mencionado. De los retratos de los pilotos ya habl\u00e9 antes, pero el realismo con el que est\u00e1n dise\u00f1ados adem\u00e1s de sus historias breves logran conectar con el jugador de la mejor manera: permiten que uno  complete los puntos e intuya las historias.\n\nLamentablemente el juego no tiene multijugador. Pero es perfecto en un s\u00f3lo jugador para destruir ciudades en breves r\u00e1fagas casuales (de 20 a 30 minutos) o en largas sesiones de juego.\n\n\u00bfLo recomiendo? S\u00ed. Brigador es destrucci\u00f3n masiva con un dise\u00f1o ne\u00f3n y retro. Sus modos de juego mantendr\u00e1n despiertos a los luchadores y a los apostadores por igual.\n\n== \n\nSi gustas, puedes leer [url=http://www.agustinfest.com/tema/los-gustos/de-videojuegos/]m\u00e1s rese\u00f1as de videojuegos[/url] en mi p\u00e1gina personal.

This is a non-stop mech/tank action strategy war game.\n\nMy favorite weapon: Konig", "timestamp_created": 1498504919, "timestamp_updated": 1498504919, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.654849", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32818247": {"recommendationid": "32818247", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048865860", "num_games_owned": 342, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 490, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500391903}, "language": "english", "review": "I had HYPOTHETICALLY pirated this a few months ago, but it's well worth the purchase and I'm glad to support the developers.

But that's not a bad thing.\n\nBrigador brings back a style of isometric action games that we've not really seen in some time. If you've ever played the \"strike\" series (Desert Strike, Nuclear Strike and so on), or the slightly more obscure \"Mass Destruction\", you know roughly what type of game it is. You're unleashed on the world in a heavily armed vehicle, and your goal is to destroy things. Brigador is not a clone of those mentioned games though, and in most ways, it's a better game. If nothing else, it's a lot faster, and has more going on at all time.  \n  \n[B]Graphics & Sound[/B] \nThe graphics in Brigador is clean, sharp & detailed. While not as technically advanced as many other modern games, Brigador does still look darn good, owing to a strong consistent art style. The screenshots are representative, that is what the game looks like. And while they might look a bit cluttered, it's usually not too hard to figure out what's going on on screen at any given moment. And yes, those are coloured lights that would make a late 90's 3D action game, like Forsaken, green with envy. Unlike those late 90's games, the use of coloured light does not end up feeling tacky though, it works.\n\nBrigador is no slouch in the audio department either. The soundtrack fits well in with the 80's/early 90's style cyberpunk feel that the game has, and helps set the mood. All weapons have suitable sound effects that make them feel like they have some weight behind them, without feeling overbearing and obnoxious. Audio feedback is very important in a game like Brigador, and it nails it. \n\n[B]Gameplay[/B]\nYou're playing as an armoured vehicle, be it a tank, mech or some other vehicle outfitted with heavy weapons. And your goal is to cause as much destruction as you possibly can. Each level has its own set of objectives, that usually boil down to \"kill X, Destroy Y, then escape\", with secondary objectives that are similar in nature. It's all very straight forward, and the game does not really stray from this formula. Depending on if you're playing the campaign, or just randomly generated maps, you either have a set of 3-4 different vehicles to chose from, or you get to design your own from parts that you've unlocked. \nExactly how you play will depend on your vehicle. Some are light and nippy, and need to always be on the move to avoid incoming projectiles, others are lumbering behemoths that can take a beating. And there's also a good variety in the weapons, with things like mortars, machine guns, heavy cannons, shotguns and so on making up the arsenal. So despite the games rather straight forward gameplay, the variety in playstyles between vehicles still make the game feel like it has a lot of variety. \nThe game encourages you to play aggressively in most cases. Collateral damage is not just not punished, but even encouraged, as you'll get greater rewards the more things you end up destroying along the way. And destroying things in Brigador feels far more satisfying than it has any right to do. \n\n[B]Final Thoughts[/B]\nBrigador is a great game. It's easy to pick up and play, and it's just darn fun. It might not be the deepest game on the market, but few games I've played match the sheer amount of fun I've had with Brigador. It's going to be one of those games that will stay on my HDD for a long time, and whenever I just feel like blowing stuff up, I'll start Brigador. So for anyone who's looking for a straight forward action game, I can't recommend Brigador enough.\n", "timestamp_created": 1498474675, "timestamp_updated": 1498474675, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 37, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.814219", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32805121": {"recommendationid": "32805121", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998911383", "num_games_owned": 274, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 638, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511693630}, "language": "english", "review": "A simply captivating experience.

These are all very positive things. From the get go it has an immediate personality in it's presentation that will suck you in, and the carnal combat within will get you hooked. \n\nSo let's break it down.\n\nPROS:\n-----------------------------------------------\n- Great visuals, unique presentation\n- A loving amount of detail has gone into desiging the weird and wild technological machines at your disposal, from the actual visual designs to the variety of weapons and their functions, stats and even flavortext herein. If you like customizing a mech not unlike armored core or such, you're gonna have fun with this.\n- Gleeful amount of destructibility in all maps. The world is your sandbox to topple over and stomp.\n- Great soundtrack. I'll admit I'm not as into the overt 80's synth stuff as some people, but if you like that kind of music, this is grade A material for you up with the likes of Hotline Miami. \n-Surprisingly fleshed out world building in the descriptions of pilots, locations, weapons, mechs, etc. It's nothing groundbreaking in it's own right, but it provides quite a bit of grim flavoring to what is, at first glance, a seemingly simple game. \n\n\nCONS:\n-----------------------------------------\n-Loadtimes are juuust long enough and the actual missions juuust short enough to give some noticable speedbumps to what is otherwise a fast and addictive game. \n\n- The weapon trajectory beams and targeting reticule UI. They manage to do a lot with it that helps feed you immediate information on potential targets. However, the trajectory beams are so bright and colorful they wind up distracting you from the actual targeting reticule, making aiming a slapdash process in the middle of a raging firefight. It's something that I think ought to be tweaked, and a minor inconvience overall- nothing game breaking. \n\n\nTL;DR :\n-------------------------------------------\nCan't reccomend it to everyone, but if you love mechs, mayhem, or just enjoy some of that garish neon 80s dystopia, this is a fun distraction that deserves a bit more recognition.", "timestamp_created": 1498363889, "timestamp_updated": 1514309993, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.474138", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32751602": {"recommendationid": "32751602", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003804328", "num_games_owned": 725, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 137, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498529708}, "language": "english", "review": "do you like piloting giant robots with chainguns that are capable of making spaghetti sauce out of the populace?

Want to joust large tanks with a short-ranged high damage weapon? I found the Tuktuk works for that too.  If you want to be more classy, go for the flying oldtimer instead.  Want to bulldoze through your enemies? Well... you can do that.  Want to stomp out enemies with a mech? You can do it.

Each weapon has a distinct report and impact sound volume that will alert enemies which you should always use to your advantage.

Pure intense mayhem. Brigador is an excellent isometric vehicular shooting game that brings the genre back, it is very similar to Bedlam and Bedlam 2: Absolute Bedlam from the '90s, and if those aren't familiar then let's say it's like the original Syndicate, but with mechs, tanks and hovercars.\n\nA wide variety of freelance missions, that you can take on with a wide variety of destructive weaponry custom picked onto your vehicle of choice. Campaign missions are where you can try out a lot of pre-made vehicles with drivers that have their own styles of approaching the battlefield.\n\nGameplay is straight to the point, move through the destructible environments, the more you destroy the better, engage enemies either directly at the range of your weaponry, or use special abilities and equipment to flank them via stealth, there's a nice amount of playstyle variance. You and the enemies have more armor in the front, so flanking is good and so is keeping the enemy from flanking you. A bunch of different control schemes for you to find the most suitable, be it with keyboard+mouse or with a controller. You can also freely change the game speed to anywhere between 50% to 100%, so that acts as a difficulty slider, or simply putting the tempo of the action to what you find most comfortable. A neat feature.\n\nThere's a lot to love in this game, the only thing missing is a multiplayer mode, this would be an absolute blast with at least a 2-player co-op mode. Maybe if there's a sequel we'll get that.\n\nHighly recommended for the top notch action and '80s-'90s retro looks and great music.

While you control a single vehicle it kind of reminds me of Syndicate. Everything is destructible and this also plays into how you tackle opponents.\n\nThere are basically two modes; campaign and freelance. I haven't finished the whole campaign yet but missions so far have been varied and sometimes challenging. After the tutorial you can choose between three differents characters/vehicles which makes a large difference in many missions. The mission briefings also add background and builds up the dystopically satiric world of Solo Nombre through decent writing.\n\nFreelance is the other mode which pretty much offers infinite replayability. There are a tons of unlockable weapons, missions, pilots and vehicles. These are unlocked by clearing either freelance or campaign missions for cash.\n\nWhat makes the game actually great though is the actual gameplay and I find it hard to come up with anything to complain about. Controls are crisp, and vehicles actually handles very differently. Most weapons are immensely satisfying to use with great SFX and animations, and different loadouts excel at different tactics. Tying in to this is the destructible environments. Instead of rushing the enemy straight on you could for example make your own path, come in from behind and make a killshot to their vulnerable rear. You can also use smoke or cloaking to avoid enemies or combine it all with luring enemies with sound to set a trap.\n\nWhen it comes to the art style I like it a lot. I would say it reminds me of old Amiga sci-fi/cyberpunk games. Pilot portraits are great with a zany quality and vehicle design is overall very good. The environments look like dystopian cyberpunk environments and serve their purpose of being levelled to the ground.\n\nIn closing I'd say that this game is a real little gem. It's perfect for picking up and playing for a short while if you feel that shooting itch most of us feel from time to time, but it also works for longer sessions, some of the freelance campaigns can take a couple of hours and you can't save in the middle of them which is a small negative.

You can even adjust the game speed if you're having trouble with the fast pace.\n\nAdditionally, the controls have been made more user-friendly, though the original control scheme is still available for those who prefer it.\n\nA definite must-have for anyone who likes giant robots, massive destruction, or isometric action games of any kind.", "timestamp_created": 1497675715, "timestamp_updated": 1497675715, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526882", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32493215": {"recommendationid": "32493215", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040334523", "num_games_owned": 287, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2161, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511752711}, "language": "english", "review": "Sits in that sweet spot between MechAssault and Hotline Miami.", "timestamp_created": 1497671480, "timestamp_updated": 1497671480, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501134", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32491589": {"recommendationid": "32491589", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028805054", "num_games_owned": 393, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1804, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511394782}, "language": "english", "review": "i didnt like it at first, but it grew on me, now im hooked, and i want more.", "timestamp_created": 1497665418, "timestamp_updated": 1497665418, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501134", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32489469": {"recommendationid": "32489469", "author": {"steamid": "76561197982743098", "num_games_owned": 240, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 8005, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512249638}, "language": "english", "review": "I highly recommend this game!\n\n-Interesting level designs\n-Great soundtrack \n-Captivating lore\n-Good difficulty implementation and curve\n-Tons of mechs/weapons", "timestamp_created": 1497658576, "timestamp_updated": 1497658576, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501134", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32487585": {"recommendationid": "32487585", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990201480", "num_games_owned": 97, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2499, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 351, "last_played": 1514328454}, "language": "english", "review": "I quickly fell in love with the gameplay an the mechanics.

Flanking has it's purpose or in some cases shielding or going stealthy to outflank your enemies has it's purpose. The game has its charm and makes you switch up your play style in different campaign scenarios or freelance missions - or play any way you see fit with whatever suits you.

You'll get a lot of bang for your buck as there are quite a lot of missions and environments to progress through and at least 3 game modes to choose from. \n\nEverything can be destroyed and nothing is safe from your wrath. There's a big variety of vehicles to choose from, all with different strengths and weaknesses. Some are slick high tech walking mechs, some are tanks made of scrap metal, some are just motorbikes or buses with guns welded to them.

the UI is by far the worst user friendly I have ever seen, which means it simply needs to be redesigned, in order  the user can understand what to do.Especially there is a thing with the buttons.Instead having plain straightforward captions like 'buy' they use confusing words like 'requisition'.Also they are placed in areas onscreen that few will pay attention to.All in all, the player does not understand what they do, nor what order does he have to use the options in the menu in order to do what he wants, like buy guns, pilots, customize the mech/vehicle and so on.  \n\n-Second thing is info management.While the game goes extensively on and on about the mission, or the pilot bio, or the lore, and all unecessary blabbing, it has no map of the level at all.This is critical, since the game is MISSION based...Moreover, it has scarce info on the weapons (that matter, 'which gun should I buy next?'), only graphs that make little sense.The enemy info has to be purchased with money won during missions.Why should anyone ingame have to pay for such a thing is beyond my comprehension.\n\nIf you consider buying it, listen to my advice, devote some of your time

The game encourages you to constantly gage how much challenge you're willing or able to take on and then always raise the stakes a little higher for greater reward. For instances, your choice of operator determines the starting difficulty and how it ramps up, while your vehicle determines the amount of firepower you can level at said challenge: more expensive operators face greater challenges for more rewards, while more expensive vehicles are substantially weaker and less durable but also grant better reward multipliers. This contrasts with other games that make you work to get the most powerful equipment; in this game, you get some of the most powerful things for free by default, and the rest are quite cheap. If you want to drive what is basically the Tuk Tuk from Just Cause 2, however, that'll run you a price so steep that it's 4x more than next most expensive vehicle, but it'll give you a 10x payout multiplier!\n\nThe number of completable objectives on each map is much greater than what you need to move on (and they can have good or dangerous consequences if you complete them), and you can often jump to the final payout mission well before completing all of the maps leading up to it. Every single object that breaks or person that dies adds to your paycheck, but you have to manage your ammo stores and your time may be worth more if spent on the objectives.\n\nThis creates a subtle ingraining of Brigador morality: Whatever it takes to get paid and get off world is paramount. You will be financially compensated for stomping on innocents, ramming through slums, and collateral damage, but you will probably find that it's not worth your time to go out of your way to do so. Civilians are worth so little to kill that shooting them on purpose may feel like a waste of resources. So, when you DO go out of your way to destroy the lives of the little people, there can be no room for doubt that you act as perversely as the Auditer or greedily beyond all reason.\n\nSpeaking of, the lore in this game is so good. Spacers in particular are genuinely unsettling in creative ways: their mechs are clearly backwards and all of their vehicles sport full-yellow paint jobs (the lore says that yellow on Solo Nobre is associated with peaceful surrender and that wearing it while fighting is utmost sacrilege; I wonder if the Spacers are even aware of that) but with bullseyes on the cockpits (which, again, appear to be on the wrong side of the mech). The aforementioned Auditer is merely the operator you can use to tour each map without worrying about hostile forces, but the lore makes an impressive effort turning him into an unusual and almost horrifying character.\n\nIf you do try to use a controller, definitely slow the game speed down. The aiming controls are much better suited to a mouse than a joypad, so a lower speed will give you some extra time to adjust the angle of elevation of your shots. For keyboard and mouse, I use Relative Controls for mechs/tanks but Screen Absolute for agravs (I may switch to Top Right Absolute but I have yet to try it).", "timestamp_created": 1497240319, "timestamp_updated": 1497240319, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.609665", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32357292": {"recommendationid": "32357292", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047932379", "num_games_owned": 184, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1673, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499644079}, "language": "english", "review": "I received this from the Humble Monthly Sub for June, and I almost regret not paying full price for this ridiculously fun game.

I don't tend to see games in my library and immediately go \"Yea, let's play that!\"\n\nBrigador has managed to not just be a game I play. Within two hours, it's managed to be a game I'll sometimes click on while paging through my list, and immediately boot up.\n\nGraphically, this feels like looking at a 90s game, but you know how when you don't watch or play or read something for a long time, you come back and it really shows it's age? Brigador feels like a very old game that has somehow managed to dodge that effect. In a world of low-poly 3d and \"8-Bit\" in name only, this striks a very odd balance that I absolutely adore.\n\nLore-wise I'm very fond of what they do. Every vehicle, weapon, enemy profile, and article has a small chunk of lore, usually under a paragraph. I feel it fits the game's atmosphere, a mercenary isn't going to know much beyond their objectives unless the actively dig for data.\n\nWhile I do love this game, it's not perfect, and the gameplay is where I actually have a few complaints. Mechs and tanks control fine, but inexplicably Agravs- armed hovercraft available to pilots- drive incredibly poorly on my machine. There's indication that moving forward in a mech moves you towards the mouse in an agrav, yet they seem to control like tanks no matter what I do. Effectively, this makes them much weaker tanks with the relatively nice ability of flying over low cover and not getting bogged down in debris.\n\nSpeaking of debris: in massive fields of it, and those do tend to pop up wherever you go, it's hard to tell what's a flat plane you can walk through, and what's still standing. \n\nFor a game with emphasis on destruction, explosive weapons and elements tend to be a bit lackluster visually. They're still very effective, but the actual blast seems significantly smaller than it should be.\n\nYet I feel like the best praise I can give here is that even though I have complaints, this is without a doubt my favorite game released this year. I've enjoyed my time with it so far, and the game seems to indicate that I have a very long way to go before I'm scraping the barrel.

It's unabashedly arcade-ish in this mentality, but it still manages to have a surprising amount of tactical depth when choosing how to approach groups of enemies or defended positions.\n\nI haven't played the original release of Brigador but I think the complaints about it being hard to control are overstated. I started playing on the new control scheme but settled for tank controls for all vehicles. The absolute control scheme seems more responsive on a keyboard/mouse, especially for the agravs - it allows you to strafe and circle around your opponents with ease. I imagine the new control scheme would be great for a gamepad, though I'm still skeptical about the agravs. Anyway, my point is, the people who write this off because of the control scheme are giant babies. There's nothing wrong with it, and you have plenty of choices in how you choose to control your vehicle.\n\nMusic is another highlight for me. It's really well done retro electronica, cca late 70s/early 80s. Obvious comparisons would be John Carpenter movies, Tangerine Dream soundtracks, maybe Blade Runner in parts. \n\nOverall probably one of the funnest action games I've played in the past while. It manages to recreate that satisfying MechCommander feeling of playing with giant robots, but replaces its clunky combat with sleek, streamlined, and surprisingly kinetic action - moves have heft and explosions feel punchy and dangerous. \n\nWith this re-release pretty much patching up everything people complained about, including adding an extensive tutorial campaign, even more vehicles, weapons, etc. as well as planning additional content to be released in the near future, this is probably the best time to get this game.

Huge levels with 100% destructible terrain mean you can carve your own path through the game, either through brute force or stealth.\n\nThere's also a ton of difficulty settings in Freelance mode in the form of pilots, each of which has a difficulty rating that is either stable or goes up steadily over multiple levels. In addition you can adjust the game speed in the menus to make things less hectic.\n\nThere's been multiple times I've broken out laughing during this game as I suddenly realize the absolute massive damage that's been done to the city during a fight. Though it might not seem like this game has much of a story, the info logs set up a surpisingly deep and darkly satiric setting. For example, you get extra pay for collateral damage. A civilian casualty is worth $50. A decorative shrub is $100.\n\nAlso worth mentioning is that the dev support has been incredible post release. There have been multiple updates including weapon rebalances to make sure everything in the game feels fun to use. \n\nThe controls may take a bit of getting used to if you aren't familiar with tank controls (however there are multiple control settings available). But once you do this game has a huge amount of entertaining content. I can't recommend this enough.", "timestamp_created": 1496986321, "timestamp_updated": 1496986321, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505632", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32280675": {"recommendationid": "32280675", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997290149", "num_games_owned": 561, "num_reviews": 96, "playtime_forever": 1103, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511911749}, "language": "english", "review": "I sincerely think there are a lot of diamonds in the rough on steam, overlooked by the deluge of asset flips and survival games, criminally underrated and deserving of so much more..\n\nBrigador is one of those games. \n\nHigh skill cap yet easy to pick up gameplay combined with ungodly replayability and a heaping helping of 'aesthetic', there's not a lot about this game that will leave you wanting, unless glorious vehicular combat isn't your cuppa joe.", "timestamp_created": 1496972208, "timestamp_updated": 1496972208, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504728", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32276803": {"recommendationid": "32276803", "author": {"steamid": "76561197981609203", "num_games_owned": 189, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2463, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505759411}, "language": "english", "review": "I had this game sitting in my wishlist for a long period of time, \nand when I finally purchased it, whoo~ boy was it worth my money. \n\nDrive and maneuver many different vehicles, ranging from, \nheavy mechs, tanks and anti-gravity vehicles. \nEach with their unique gameplay mechanics, harpoints and maneuverability. \nEquip them with dozens of various weapons, like, mortars, cannons, gatling guns, \nmissile launchers, rail guns, etc... \n\nThe sheer amount of unlockables is amazing, and I really enjoy playing the freelance mode, \nwhere you choose everything, from pilot, vehicle, weaponry, sub-equipment and then a mission you want to tackle. \nUpon successfully completing a mission, you'll get money, which you use to unlock items. \n\nBrigador reminds me a lot of old games like Desert Strike, Jungle Strike and Urban Strike,\nbut instead of having \"destroy these first\", \"then rescue this\", \"before time runs out destroy these\", \nyou are given a vehicle, and told \"hey this is your mission, do it the way you like, also, don't worry of destroying buildings\". \n\nThe soundscape is fantastic, and together with absolutely beautiful 80's soundtrack, it all greatly falls into an one big great experience.\n\nIn the end, Brigador is a satisfying, game of wreacking havoc and destruction everywhere you go, no matter which vehicle you drive, in the neon light streets while blasting your cannons in unison with the great beats of the soundtrack.\n\nVarlet/10", "timestamp_created": 1496957891, "timestamp_updated": 1496958162, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32276665": {"recommendationid": "32276665", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021308169", "num_games_owned": 928, "num_reviews": 58, "playtime_forever": 132, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512087269}, "language": "english", "review": "Relaunched just in time for the anniversary of the Killdozer!", "timestamp_created": 1496957534, "timestamp_updated": 1496957534, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32273794": {"recommendationid": "32273794", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072644230", "num_games_owned": 127, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 1916, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510520389}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is an excellent throwback to mech combat games in the 90's.

I had never seen a single image of this game or of its indev version Matador. I had not seen this on my Steam reccomended list, curators list, or on RPS. I wasn't scouring, but still. I regret getting this in a bundle, because I know I'd have purchased this the moment I saw it at $20, and I would've bought it sooner then that at the current $14. \n\nBrigador is almost a simple concept; you are a mercenary pilot, and your contract is to topple a South American style dictatorship on a far off colony world. You pilot a mech walker, tanks, tiny power-suits, and even anti-gravity tanks [all in three distinct enough factions]. The weapons feel very real, the controls are incredibly solid, and the combat is incredibly refreshing and difficult. For anyone who fell in love with C&C games like Red Alert or especially Tiberian Sun, they will be visibly aroused by the graphics. The description by devs that this is a 'Kool-Aid man simulator' is remarkably applicable, as the best tactic is often to rush through an apartment block flanking your foe.\n\nI am not even finished with the campaign, of which there are literally a dozen tutorial levels that actually have meat, and two dozen actually missions with 4 different starting configuartions each to complete. You earn money, and funnel that back into puchasing pilots and gear to use in Operations, something almost akin to Diablos dungeons. You can purchase packs of anywhere from 2 to 20+ levels to run through any pilot configuration you choose, earning money based on how difficult you've made it for yourself. That makes for a very nice feedback loop, much nicer then, say, Diablos. You earn only pride for beating a Hell level run with a shitty motorcycle, but you crave that pride. Like starting a Dwarf Fortress map on a glacier, just because.\n\nAnother aspect I find absolutely incredible is the dev team. For a small team to place this much effort, polish, and obvious enthusiasm into a $20 package, rather then a watered down $40-$60 game with in-game purchases and DLC level packs gallore. This is an incredible amount of game for the money. Not to mention how responsive to community I have seen them be. Two separate devs came to answer an angry thread about a particularily tricky level, and both took a lot of time to explain as best they could to the player, but also preserving the experience. They didn't say \"Yeah theres a command we use to skip levels...\". To take the time out of their day like that as a developer is unique. Assasins Creed devs don't do tech support. \n\nAll in all I highly reccomend this game to several people; Mech enthusiasts, C&C junkies, lovers of strategy, lovers of finely crafted menus and UI's, and fans of Just Cause. Just cause they're pretty similar with the dictator thing.\n\n12/10, cannot wait to see what this team does next.", "timestamp_created": 1496806503, "timestamp_updated": 1496806503, "voted_up": true,

It feels like it should have been a classic from the mid 90s, with uncommonly beautiful 2D sprites and a peculiar weight and physicality to the combat. Initially, the reliance on mission briefings and log entries for the delivery of the story seems a bit too spare and obtuse, but taking the time to read the lore reveals a surprisingly rich world depicted with nuanced and sympathetic prose. Amusingly, the lore must be purchased from the same menu as mechs and upgrades, which is entirely thematic (as a brigador, you're not really supposed to be invested in the world of Solo Nobre), while also tidily sequestering the story away from those who are really only here for the explosions.\n\nAnd oh what wonderful explosions they are.

You drop into a zone and complete any number of objectives before exfiltrating. You can blast everything in your path, but sneaking is usually an option with the right vehicle. There are a gazillion unique, and well-designed, vehicles you can unlock, divided into three categories; tanks, mechs and antigrav. \n\nCategories of vehicles all share common traits but they come in all shapes, sizes and forms. Hulking heavy mechs like the Touro are the most straightforward; good for overall mayhem with heavier weapon mounts and strong hull and shields, while smaller vehicles like the Mongoose powersuit require a much more subtle approach, sneaking around and ambushing lone units before hiding again. A fast, light antigrav like the Rope Kid might require you to stay on the move, doing hit and runs, 'knife-fighting' or do repeating jousting attacks with short-range, high power weapons.\n\nThis is where the beauty of Brigador lies. Picking a random vehicle and figuring out what loadout and tactics work best for that particular one is really fun. If you've mastered one, you pick another and find that it's a whole different game. Some are harder than others of course, but you are rewarded accordingly for picking harder vehicles (and difficulties). Mastering a hard vehicle is truly satisfying.\n\nThe campaign takes you through a lengthy tutorial (introduced in the Up-Armored relaunch) and a series of missions featuring a few vehicles with preset loadouts for each. It works well for demonstrating the diversity aspect of the game, but the meat of it all lies in Freelance mode. This is where you pick a vehicle and loadout and go on operations through a varying number of districts. The more you do in a row, the more cash you will make for unlocks, but ammo, hull and shields carry through each level. Dying before a run is complete will forfeit most of the rewards. The pilot you pick sets the difficulty and also determines the reward multiplier, which stacks with the multiplier set by the vehicle you're piloting. Pull off a long, difficult run with a tricky vehicle and earn massive rewards.\n\nWeapons are as varied as the vehicles themselves, including cannons of many calibers and ammo types, machineguns and autocannons, mortars and howitzers for indirect fire, along with energy weapons of multiple types. They all do differently against shields, hull, and cover, and behave differently in regards to range and firing arcs. Weapons also have penetration values so depending on the circumstances, you might be able to take shots through walls or take out multiple enemies with one shot. Figuring out how the shooting works is a learning experience on its own, and may lead to some frustration as you might for example shoot over low-profile enemies despite aiming straight for them (tip: aim slightly in front to get the right elevation in such circumstances, or behind to avoid shooting under antigrav vehicles). You will also have to take care standing clear of obstacles (not always easy since you tend to look at your target instad of your own vehicle) as you fire since a building might not only block your shot but might turn your own awesome firepower against you (looking at you, siege howitzer). Explosive hazards are not always easy to see or identify, and you might walk into an exploding fuel pipeline or two before you get the hang of it, but destroying such hazards have an intrinsic value in that it distracts enemies and might set you up for a tasty ambush.\n\nThis game is a gem; the developers, Stellar Jockeys, have been working hard on new content over the past year, keeping their ears open and have lovingly crafted a hell of a game. With the recent re-launch things have only become better, adding much needed polish and a proper tutorial. The background lore can nearly be ignored since focus is on gameplay but if you care to look you will find some very cool stuff there too. I can recommend reading the fucking amazing Brigador novel by Brad Buckmaster. The soundtrack by Makeup And Vanity Set is killer as well.

I don't mean to imply it's anything like any of those gameplay-wise (it's not completely unlike FutureCop, but it's nowhere near a clone of it), but it's just so well-produced, charming and engrossing like those examples and definitely has a special feel to it. It's also pretty difficult at times, which would've also been appropriate in that era.\n\nThe gameplay itself is properly great and much deeper than you might expect; there's all sorts of different tactics to use including hit and run stealth (which I find the most fun but also very difficult to pull off properly), tons of weapons and vehicles, great attention to detail in both the design and writing of the entire game and an awesome soundtrack. There's a [i]lot[/i] of game here, I've played a fair bit and I haven't even finished the campaign yet.\n\nWhat I love about it is it's maybe one third straightforward isometric twin stick-ish shooter, one third tactical combat and one third puzzle; each campaign mission gives you four pilots to choose from and each presents a wildly different strategy, working out how to complete the mission you just aced using the aptly-named Treehouse, this time using a tracked motorbike with a tenth of the durability and damage output (but ten times more speed) will have you scratching your head for sure. It never gets old! Then there's the Freelancer mode, which is actually the meat of the game, where you get to choose your own pilot, vehicle and weapons and therefore set your own challenge.\n\nThe only downsides I can think of are the weapon sight lines can be hard to use at times, especially against Agravs (floating enemies), I've died more than once by accidentally launching a huge artillery shell at a building I'm practically inside because of this. It's difficult to tell which weapon will fire on which mouse button, I feel this could've been handled better, but I get around this by giving most targets both barrels until I learn which is which so that's a minor one. Explosive scenery has also killed me a number of times because it's hard to focus on shooting a large group of enemies and moving at the same time, but you work out how to stop doing that after a few times. I think that's it, I haven't encountered any bugs, cheap deaths or poor balance in my time with it.\n\nIn summary, I'd recommend this so strongly that I've bought two copies of it besides my own (technically one was in the Humble monthly but still counts, damn it) to distribute and will buy more when it's full price again to support the devs. \n\nAlthough I feel like I haven't said enough about the quality of the writing. Fortunately the Brigador wiki has a lot (if not all) of the lore and intel transcribed so you can see that for yourself even before you buy. I'm fairly sure this gave me goosebumps the first time I read it, being so vivid and evocative as it is (spoilered, but doesn't give away any of the story, in fact there's not actually a story to spoil):\n\n[spoiler]\"When Spacers really want you dead they just quietly drop in one of their kill squads, powersuits decked in camo fields, Lockdowns, and Black Hands. Those guns are quiet, those suits are quiet, and pretty soon their targets are quiet too.\n\nIf there's anything that keeps me up at night, that's it.\"[/spoiler]\n\nSo cool.", "timestamp_created": 1496684859, "timestamp_updated": 1496684903, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.700031", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32203534": {"recommendationid": "32203534", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961914427", "num_games_owned": 320, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 477, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497817479}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is awesome. That's it. It's awesome. Everything about it is fantastic with the exception that vehicle customization is somewhat limited. Two weapons plus a special. But that is compensated for by the sheer number of vehicles and weapons so it's a rather moot point and you will surely find a vehicle that caters to exactly how you want to play - and there is a huge variety - hover cars, tanks, walking mechs, and others.\n\nOk, on to the details:\n\nThe graphics are great. Dated in the same way something like Super Meat Boy is dated but perfectly fits the game. Obviously intentional. It's dark and usually night-ish time for some reason. Everything can be destroyed. The only problem with this is that you'll enjoy destroying things so much you'll run out of ammo :) If there's a story, I can't find it. I feel like I am playing the bad guys because I am often romping through residentail areas destroying houses and stepping on fleeing people. Awesome. It's kind of refreshing. The music fits the environments and graphics perfect. Its dark and snythetic 80's dystopian...something. I don't know much about music.\n\nThe missions themselves are all \"destroy the thing\". This is good because shooting guns is awesome and exploding things is great. The only issue with this that I have run into is that some of your objectives blow up real good. I say this is an issue because I've been in situations where I have run out of ammo, the ammo depot was destroyed, and I only have stomp left. My own fault. Again, see my comment about shooting everything.\n\nThe learning curve in this game is sort of high. Think of it as a twin stick shooter but the direction of your guns is often independent of the direction your legs/treads are facing. This means you can move around in one direction and shoot in another. This might take some getting used to if you've not played other games that work like this. But there are excellent tool-tips throughout the missions. You walk up to these objects and some text is on the screen. At first I wanted this gone so I could just play but the implementation is perfect and few games do this right. There are even reminders about past tips that are situated perfectly. It's like the game read my mind and was never annoying or patronizing. The text is only on the screen so long as you are close to these objects and the tips/instructions are always helpful. Perfectly designed so if you want to skip it you can and if you need the help, they actually provide good help. And you can go back to these objects at any time if you get lost or need help.\n\nThe mechanics in this game also exceed what I was expecting. Mechs can crouch!!!! This helps you avoid fire. Your weapons have an extreme range limit (usually). Far too often you play top-view games like this and your cannon fires all of 60' and disappears. In this your guns may as well have unlimited range - which is how it should be. It means you can properly snipe and use stealth to kill things from far away. Most vehicles have some kind of grenade. Some are smoke or EMP. The arc is helpful. And if you are smart about it, things like smoke deploy multiple projectiles over time so you can move your reticle to spread out the smoke grenades. Very smart and allows for a higher skill ceiling. Going back to movement of your vehicle, it all feels really good. With weapons/turrets separate from treads/feet, they have differing turn rates. Machine guns might turn faster than a cannon (or a mount turns at different speed - not sure yet) so you have to factor that in when maneuvering. You need to keep an eye where your feet are facing relative to your guns. Also, where you point your cursor is where the gun fires on the ground so you can hit small things on the ground quite easily but if the cursor is beyond the target, you could easily shoot over it to hit something behind.\n\nIf there was one thing I would add to this game is co-op multiplayer (either local or online or both). Also, if the maps are any bigger than I've experienced (about 2/3 the way through the campaign), a minimap would be helpful but I've never really gotten lost at all. There are indicators at the edge of your screen where stuff is. Sometimes finding/getting to the exit after completing the goals takes a minute but that's it.\n\n9.5/10.\n\nI was given this game by a fellow Redditor after commenting that this game looked awesome.", "timestamp_created": 1496681412, "timestamp_updated": 1496704739, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.530612", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32203255": {"recommendationid": "32203255", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051325657", "num_games_owned": 1009, "num_reviews": 119, "playtime_forever": 353, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496655499}, "language": "french", "review": "Port\u00e9 par des graphismes vraiment superbes et une BO extra ordinaire de Makeup & Vanity Set, Brigador est une tuerie pour tous les nostalgiques de Desert Strike et autres jeux d\u00e9riv\u00e9s.\nPour les autres, il sera peut \u00eatre un peu trop exigeant, m\u00eame si la Up-Armored Edition a amen\u00e9 tout un lot de mission \"tutos\" pour apprendre le jeu en douceur.", "timestamp_created": 1496680700, "timestamp_updated": 1496680700, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32202276": {"recommendationid": "32202276", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070712973", "num_games_owned": 400, "num_reviews": 88, "playtime_forever": 543, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500684992}, "language": "english", "review": "Wonderful game that is hard to pidgeon-hole.

It\u2019s also useful if you want to be sure you\u2019re not exposing your rear as a tank since your front is always more armored (as a mech; hold shift to crouch instead). And I mean this: crouching as a mech and always showing your front to the enemy as a tank makes a huge difference in the harder difficulties. Also don\u2019t forget to use your abilities, and ramming/stomping.\n\nWhat else is there to say? The graphics are amazing, the lightning is like nothing you\u2019ve seen on a 2D game, the vehicle designs are top notch, the soundtrack is genuinely memorable and the lore is cryptic and reminds me of Syndicate.

Looking to upgrade to the DDE just for the OST - it really is that good on its own.\n\nGameplay wise it's fantastic and keeps you wanting to go back and just blow up more things. You get a full-blown campaign, each mission is offered to finish with 4 different vehicles, giving you the choice between full-front assault on the enemy and sneaky hit'n'run tactics, where you can't take your chances to get overwhelemed by the enemy, have to use stealth, strategy and be careful about your surroundings. Or you could just steamroll through the enemy on a 3-story war machine. This is a really great way to offer variety to the gameplay, please different playstyles and easily quadruple the time spent in said campaign.\nThere's ton of different vehicles and weapons, and each has it's distinct feel an playstyle. Big vehicles and guns are slow and unmaneuverable but hit hard, and smaller guns are fast and precise. You can feel the clunkiness of a rotating tower and the heavyness of a 105 mm shell going through a house.\n\nYou're also offered a Freelance mode, for which you unlock vehiles, weapons, abilities and pilots and are free to combine them in different manner. Basically, its own sandbox. Pilots offer a variety of difficulty levels and pacing to the game, either you want things easy, go from easy to hard or crank up the difficulty to 11. \n\nEVERYTHING in this game has own lore which is damn fun to read and immerse yourself in the world of Brigador.\n\nThis game is a gem and a love child of a 5-people team, easily one of the best ones I've played in years. There aren't any games of this genre on my memory and Brigador is King.\nGet it for yourself and your friends, it's really worth it.

Indeed, that core aspect does play very well. But there\u2019s more than meets the eye here. While that is definitely the case and it definitely does deliver on that front, Brigador is also a game with a hidden depth. \n\nWith a large variety of vehicles and weapons to choose from, all with their own strengths and weaknesses, Brigador offers many ways to realise that massive destruction. Do you want to run a hoverbike with shield shredding lasers and optic camo for a hit-and-run / stealthy glass cannon? Do you want to run a chemical spewing, lead wall blasting tank? How about a mech with cannons designed to snipe through cover? Choosing and tinkering with the method of obliteration is half the fun here.\n \nThe campaign gives you an environment to learn the ins and outs of vehicle types, weapon types and general mechanics. Freelance mode on the other hand gives you the opportunity to tailor gameplay to your liking, choosing overall difficulty, exact vehicle loadouts (or just randomize it for funsies) and the mission you want to play. \n\nHowever, I will say that from what I have seen mission types are a bit lacking across both modes and can generally be put into one of two categories; blow up specified buildings, or blow up specified enemy units. There are side-objectives but again, they\u2019re mostly just variations of those two types. Additionally, I found myself getting caught on terrain occasionally but whether that's down to the game or just my situational awareness in combat not being what it should be, I don't know. \n\nStylistically Brigador feels very much like a mid to late 90\u2019s sci-fi game got lost somewhere in time and ended up getting developed in the modern era by mistake. From the general aesthetic to the animations to the music, everything captures those styles perfectly and gives them a nice new coat of paint. In particular the visual style reminds me a LOT of Command and Conquer: Tiberian Sun. \n\nMuch like the mechanical depth of the game the amount of lore might not immediately be apparent, but there\u2019s a lot of world building that went into the universe. Tidbits of information are given to you in the mission briefings, which give you an idea of the interactions between factions and what life is like on the planet and individual cities. Beyond that almost everything is given a backstory available to unlock and read from a screen in the main menu. And I mean almost everything. But if you\u2019re not the kind of person that\u2019s into reading the history of a world, you\u2019re not obligated to. There\u2019s no intrusive cutscenes or anything like that so if you just want to jump in and blow stuff up with no regard for plot or setting, you\u2019re not held back from doing so. \n\nSo all in all, Brigador is a fun, explosion filled game that\u2019s pretty easy to pick up but with enough depth to keep it engaging, despite perhaps being slightly repetitive when it comes to objectives. It\u2019s a game that is mechanically and stylistically on point and gives the player a lot of options. Brigador feels like something that was made with a vision in mind, and a game that used its inspirations to make something new instead of something derivative.", "timestamp_created": 1496602601, "timestamp_updated": 1496626621, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502756", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32182695": {"recommendationid": "32182695", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048176516", "num_games_owned": 293, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 226, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496613171}, "language": "english", "review": "If you are a fan of Mech warfare, buy this game\nIf you are a fan of destructible areas, buy this game\nIf you are a fan of great isometric maps, buy this game\nIf you are a fan of stunning soundtracks, buy this game\n\nReally, just buy this game.

Crazy good soundtrack that I would've bought even if the game never existed.\n\nWhat I do wanna stress though is how fuckin awesome the developers are. This game is very clearly a labor of love. All the detail they've put into it, the amazing support, consistently adding new content (like this new relaunch that added a bunch of stuff and just improved the game overall for FREE), and the fact that they are always engaging with the players. You don't often see a game that is so loved by the people that created it, and that is what makes Brigador such a brilliant game. \n\nPlease get it so Stellar Jockeys/Gausswerks can keep adding stuff and developing new games. \n\nPS: For complaints about the controls; they've added alternate styles, but honestly, just practice with the default controls.

It's now an amazing game. \n\nThe tweaks and additions may not seem that huge on paper, but in practise they make the game so much better.

There is also a freelance mode, which is more like a sandbox which can last a number of maps depending on how you set your run.\n\nThe vehicle types feel different and control differently (the game is based on tank controls) but there are a lot of control options to tweak them to your liking. I play with a controller, and I do just fine. The vehicles themselves offer a lot of variety, have cool visual designs, and awesome lore associated with them.\n\nThe artwork for this game is amazing; I've never enjoyed looking at portraits so much. The UI is also quite pleasing. The music is also amazing (awesome John Carpenter-style 80s synth), so the soundtrack DLC is super worth it. \n\nThe devs are also very friendly and approachable.

And rather gracefully, it brings these elements together in a mech/tank/hovertank action game where you level entire city blocks.\n\nA quick run-down of the setting: The game takes place in the city of Solo Nombre, on the planet Novo Solo, an off-world colony far from earth.\n\nA while ago, this colony was taken over by a dictator simply known as \"Great leader\", who turned the colony into a North-Korea style, hyper-isolationist city-state.\n\nTonight, he has died.\n\nPretty much immediately, you have a rebel uprising happening, loyalists trying to cling to the old ways, a highly advanced outside faction called the \"spacers\" using the opportunity to essentially invade, and your employer, a shady corporation, hiring mercs to \"represent their interests\" as well. And it's all happening in one night. A battle royale to be sure!\nOh, don't worry though, despite the game being set all in the same night, the devs were kind enough not to give us time limits. (Thank you devs!)\n\nAs for the gameplay, it's quite a good mix. On easier difficulty settings, with stronger vehicles, you will pretty much steamroll everything, but get fairly small rewards. The higher the difficulty gets and the more challenging the vehicle you pick, the more you will have to play it smart and carefully, but the richer you will become. It's quite charming that way.\n\n\nAnyways, i'm truly hoping that this game gets a bit of a late updraft in popularity. Maybe it's just me, but i had never even heard of it before i randomly stumbled upon it in the store, the other day. And for a game this fun, that's just not right.\n\n\nSo yeah, a clear thumbs up. I heartily recommend you give this game a whirl, and i hope it's been successful enough for the devs to make future titles!", "timestamp_created": 1495394282, "timestamp_updated": 1495395258, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 156, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.873938", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31873119": {"recommendationid": "31873119", "author": {"steamid": "76561197974927580", "num_games_owned": 66, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 67, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1454268221}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is a blast to play.

Well I won't lie to you, life expectancy is short, there's not much in the way of benefits, but for a single night's work you'll be able to retire and never work a day in your life. Of course, after you've levelled a few city blocks, crushed a few tanks beneath the feet of a Touro or a Broodmare, or fired a pair of Konigs long enough that it overpowers the drive engines on your Huss, you may not want to retire. And if you've ever fielded a Black Hand or something firing Tubaro, you'll likely make some friends who will never let you retire. And frankly the most blinding of Las-raves won't compare to firing a Disco laser till your batteries run dry. And you'll probably never let your self get stuck in traffic again after you've wrecked the infrastructure of a city or three, or smashed, shot, and exploded your way down a chocked highway. And after you've fired a Zeus a few times you'll never want to stop. Or you may never feel safe again after you've seen it smash through it's target, the tank behind it, and stop a few hab complexes down the road.\n\nMe? I say do it. You only live once, and when someone is smashing their way through your neighborhood in a sixty foot mech without a concern for collateral damage while they annhilate the local garrison, do you want to be running around in a yellow raincoat or inside the bipedal death machine firing bullets the size of beer bottles at whatever the fuck you want?", "timestamp_created": 1494382878, "timestamp_updated": 1494382878, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31549731": {"recommendationid": "31549731", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994528502", "num_games_owned": 369, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2560, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504404267}, "language": "english", "review": "Where to start.\n\nBrigador is an isometric vehicle action game in which you are a pilot from one of three factions given a unique opportunity to make a large sum of money.\n\nSolo Nobre is a city on the colony world of Solo Novo. Years ago, control of it was seized from the sponsoring corporations that founded it in a militant uprising led by a man known only as Great Leader. Great Leader ensured his control over the city by erecting a series of orbital cannons meant to ward off any invasion from above while his armies secured Solo Nobre through military force and the division of the city into walled districts. All contact with the outside world and the galaxy at large was cut off, with Great Leader's watchful cannons ensuring the security of Solo Nobre.\n\nThis seizure of power was not without opposition. At the end of the Nobrean Civil War, a surviving band of revolutionaries, the Corvids, began to slowly rebuild and make plans of a new revolt, for they believe that the only way for Solo Nobre to prosper is under a free and democratic government. This goal, to them, must be reached no matter the cost.\n\nThe Solo Nobre Concern, a shadowy organization created by the founding interests of Novo Solo, wish to retake their rightful property. That's where you come in.\n\nTonight, Great Leader has died. The Loyalist Military under his command is in disarray, and the Corvids have taken this opportunity to launch their own uprising and have already seized several districts. In addition to this, the Spacers, a transhuman mercenary element from Deep Space have arrived upon Novo Solo in search of profit and glory. You are a Brigador- a paid mercenary hired by the Solo Nobre Concern to carry out certain military objectives within the confines of Solo Nobre, with the end goal of liberating the city in one night and allowing it to shelter once more under the umbrella of economic prosperity provided by the SNC.\n\nWhether you're a defecting Loyalist in search of passage offworld, an opportunistic Corvid looking for personal gain, or a ravenous Spacer thirsting for glory and wealth, only one thing matters tonight.\n\nGreat Leader is dead.\n\nSolo Nobre must fall.\n\nHere is your Contract.\n\nDo you accept?\n\n=================================================================\n\nThe game itself is fantastic. Smooth controls (they may take some getting used to, but alternate control schemes are available in options), beautiful visuals that look like a proper evolution from a 90's action game (unlike so many \"retro\" games these days, who simply awkwardly pantomime the style), and a fantastic soundtrack (by Makeup and Vanity Set) that immerses you starting from the main menu. \n\nYou have a vast selection of vehicles, weapons, and special abilities that will aid you in your mission to bring destruction to Solo Nobre, and the three factions each have their own selection of platforms across three types (Mechs, Tanks, and Antigravity Vehicles). Each faction also has a wide selection of pilots who serve as difficulity and income multipliers, as well as revealing intimate background information about themselves and the factions they serve.\n\nThe writing is superb, with the background slowly coming into full view as you unlock equipment, pilots, intelligence entries on enemy vehicles, and a good spread of dediated lore entries as well that elaborate upon the world of Novo Solo and the galaxy at large. If you enjoy the sort of storytelling where everything isn't immediately apparent and you must work to unlock the world's secrets, then Brigador will satisfy you.\n\nOne final thing that I personally appreciate is that the Devs are very active in the game's discussion forums, and won't hesitate at all to listen to your comments, or answer any and all questions about anything related to the game and its development.\n\nOn top of being a fantastic game, it's going to be growing even further. The Devs have announced that on June 2nd they'll be rolling out a re-release that adds more vehicles, pilots, and a redone tutorial campaign as well as an entirely new campaign. Whether anything else will be hiding among these goodies, I can't say, but I know that I'm looking forward to June 2nd. It will also be going on sale then, which will no doubt encourage many more to try it.\n\nIf you like gritty science fiction, kick-ass action, amazing electronic soundtracks, and fantastic writing, give Brigador a chance.

The mechs/tanks/anti-grav vehicles all feel nice and heavy. The game has an amazingly good atmosphere and soundtrack for a big stompy mech game, It just oozes style out of every pore.  A very detailed lore and backstory for all the factions. The campaign is both great for getting the hang of how to use all the different vehicles and weapons, and very hard on some of the final missions. The freelance mode gives you the ability to run wild on the city with hundreds of different mech/pilot/gear combinations. It also runs almost flawlessly on my old AMD potato laptop slightly below the games min-spec.\n\nAll in All, Brigador is well worth the asking price. I fully recommend it to anyone looking for alittle real robo action. \n\n-Sidenote-\nThe Brigador Dev Team has been one of the best and most helpfull Ive seen on the whole of the steam community in quite some time.

In every aspect, Brigador is king. When another TSS gets crowned, Brigador will be god.\nIt is that good.\n\nGraphically, it looks like someone took Syndicate and made a table-top miniatures game out of it, played it on Grampa's model railroad table, then re-digitized it. Maps ooze detail, sometimes literally. When you blow up a building, for example, you'll often see red gibs fly out...\n...because there were civilians in there.\nBut that's okay, because civilians are worthless and need to die, too. We'll get to that in a bit.\nEvery pixel counts, and it's not all just brown bleh indicitive of a Grimdark game. Neon lights, green farms, golf courses; Brigador has a pretty mixed biome for the genre. Explosions and lasers and mortars and whatever other ways you choose to rip the maps apart look great as well.\n\nAnother point I need to bring up, though, is consistancy. Character portraits all look as though they are from the same artist (no weird one-off or random anime characters mixed in), and all of the other 2D art assets look like they fit into the universe. Even the goofy cameo by a Something Awful goon somehow fits.\n3D art assets...there are none. Which is good. Because then it would look awkward. All of the little dudes and mechs and tanks and giant moving towers with turrets made from the carcasses of Toyota Previa minivans look amazing and are meticulously animated. They look like wargaming miniatures!\n\nThe music never gets tiring. It weirdly fits into the retro-futuristic, neon and cyborg-vomit aesthetic. I'd buy the soundtrack, but I've been listening to it for over 20 hours, so I don't think I need to bring it into the car. Lasers don't sound like 'pew pew!'; they sound like popping capacitors (which is more like they should sound). Only thing I can ask are of the explosions. Could be a little more impactful. But, this might be due to a more technical issue I have with the audio. Sounds (other than music) seem to either be coming from one speaker or another. This often has me panning the camera just to see if my other speaker is having issues.\n\nThe universe is interesting enough to get me to buy the book just to learn more about it. There is plenty of lore to buy with earned in-game money (because knowledge costs, even if it is about your job). Think William Gibson with suicidal depression had a discussion with Trent Reznor back in the early 90's. All you need to know from here is that everyone is valuable in such a way as you get paid for civilian casualties. SPL really wants you to clean this place up. Personally, I'm cool with that.\n\nTo kill off those combatants and non-combatants, you have a lot of weapons and vehicles at your disposal. From normal stuff like stompy mechs to welded together cars, things that hover and tanks that roll on trackballs, you get it all. You even get the Killdozer, which is a real thing--look it up.\nPlenty of weapons too, to fit anyone. Personally, I like chemical weapons that corrode things and melt people. This allows me to live out the fantasy of using them on groups of civilians without getting executed for warcrimes.\nAnd I really like launching them from a Toyota Previa.\nOr using dual machineguns from a Tuk-Tuk.\nOr stomping around in a little (reletive to map-size) powersuit and sneaking up behind massive mechs and tearing them down.\n\nI don't have any issues with the controls. Mouse and keyboard, works fine. AGRAVs take a little getting used to, and you have to get used to the difference between jumping between a tank with a turret and a mech that needs to turn to fire at a target behind it, but that comes quick. Because you die if it doesn't.\n\nSo yea, play it. Difficulty is extreme, but so is the fun. $20 is pretty modest for the amount of content you get with the game. I'm 22 hours in and struggling, but enjoying the hell out of it. If you like twin-stick-shooters, cyberpunk-cool, stompy robots, tanks, floaty things, guns, and/or killing without remorese or penalty, the game is for you.\n\n\ntl;dr: The game is fantastic and you should play it.

The dev's have done a superb job making this feel a bit retro, with a grand futuristic feel as well!  A game done right for gamers that love mech games.  A MUST buy for mech lovers! It's easily one of the best mech games I have played and harkens back to the Mech Warrior days! Many KUDOS to the dev's!!!\n\nGraphics are very nice and sounds that match gameplay to the tee!

There's been an upswelling in nostalgia-based games and 1980s aesthetics over the past few years, and this one takes both into places that I don't usually see. You're given control of any one of a number of different mechs, tanks, and hovertanks (I think the total is up around 50 now, with something like 50 weapons to mix-and-match into your loadout), thrown into a sprawling isometric landscape (might be urban, might be rural, might be industrial) and told \"Go.\"\n\nBefore getting to the \"standard\" elements of a review, I want to point out that Brigador knows how to present itself as a unified entity. The visuals, sound effects, soundtrack, and text all mesh together into a coherent whole expertly. This is an element of design that's hard to precisely identify (and even harder to learn), but it's the difference between having a bunch of different elements - gameplay, visuals, sounds - running at the same time, and having a single *thing*, the game. It's worth more than the sum of its parts, as they say. Even outside of the main gameplay loop it maintains this, through the extensive lore and intel entries for every vehicle, weapon, and location in the game. Read them - really. They're good.\n\nAlso, before getting farther into things, essential note: you can stomp things with your mech. Sometimes video games don't let you do this, or don't handle it in a satisfying way. Here, the stomping is good, very good. There's a palpable delay after you hit the \"stomp\" button as your mech winds up, and then - a shock wave, and a cacaphony, and everything in your immediate vicinity crashes down. The bigger the mech, the slower and more powerful the stomp. It feels great.\n\nThe basic loop is start level, shoot everything, end level. It's satisfying, for the most part, although this isn't the kind of game I sit down and play for hours on end. More of a \"run through a couple missions when I have some free time\" kind of thing. Money from completed missions can be put towards unlocking new vehicles, weapons, and levels, or it can be used to unlock intel and lore entries. While sometimes this kind of locking-off of content can be bothersome, here it's not so bad. You can make enough running the easier missions that the difficulty curve doesn't make it impossible to make progress here. And I've found that the fact that lore and intel are initially locked off means I'm more likely to read through them once I do unlock them. Maybe this is just apologia for something I like, I dunno. But they're worth reading through! They point things out about the various places you visit and the vehicles you use to utterly destroy them that would be missed during normal gameplay, and help to bring together the overall narrative, reinforcing the bits you get from mission briefings and loadout text.\n\nThe controls . . . well, as someone who only played Desert Strike at a friend's house, and that only for a few minutes at a time before the system's owner demanded I give up the controller, it took some getting used to. Actually, that's a lie - I'm still terrible with the default controls. Tank controls! They're tough when said tank is a small object on a busy screen (a beautiful screen, but a busy beautiful). Had they been the only option, I might not be writing this review, because I might not haven ended up playing enough to feel up to it. But an update did come, and screen-relative movement (as opposed to vehicle-relative) is an option for us folks who don't have the muscle memory ingrained from years of isometric shooters. Open up the options, scroll down, set a couple options, and now up really is up (or up-right, or up-left, depending on your preference). Seriously - the fact that the devs added this option speaks to their attentiveness to the fact that what works for one person might not work for another. That's a difficult sense to cultivate in any situation, but especially so in a nostalgia-fest like Brigador, where \"it's always been like this\" is often seen as the law of the land, rather than a potential area for improvement or iteration.\n\nThe audio and visual quality here is superb. The mechs and tanks of you and your enemies are gorgeous, and the lighting - the lighting! It's fantastic! Each actor on the screen - be it your player vehicle, an opponent, or one of the innumerable civilians wandering around Syndicate-style - casts a glow from their headlights or flashlights, and the landscape is lit up by neon signs, streetlamps, and warning lights. And explosions, of course. And lasers. Those kinds of things. Projectiles light up the ground as they pass, making each battle into a lightshow. And your footsteps and engines thump and rumble, and your weapons - and this is a surprisingly rare thing, even in big-budget releases - actually sound like they have impact. The different factions involved - there are three whose equipment you can choose from - each have a distinct look and feel. The Loyalists are standard government military: olive drab, blocky, heavy armor. The Corvids are the raiders, the junkyard dogs, and their vehicles look the point, cobbled together from old cars and salvaged wreckage. Their \"Treehouse\" tank in particular comes to mind, a towering pile of scrap with a station wagon - a station wagon! - perched on top to serve as the housing for the main gun. And there's the Spacers, who are all, uh, weird-lookin'. Industrial, would be the word, I guess. Each class of vehicle (mech, tank, a-grav) has a number of weight classes, with the smallest being motorcycles or battlesuits and the largest standing multiple stories tall.\n\nAnyway, that's Brigador, in broad and narrow brush.

A completely polished action game, with a glossy cyberpunk aesthetic and gorgeous soundtrack. \n\nThe action is both very fast and very deliberate. You command a mech (or a tank, or a pickup truck with a machine gun, or a jetbike, or a stack of cars with an artillery gun on top). In real-time action, you roll through suburbs, railyards, and necropolises, taking on scores of machines as powerful as yours. The opposition is always heavy, so tactics are key. You're gonna want to lure enemies to move near ammo dumps and gas lines. Sometimes you'll hide behind a thick wall and lob artillery. Sometimes you will just engage the cloaking device and run away. \n\nThe Campaign mode is an introduction to the game and its mechanics, serving up one map at a time, and a small number of pre-cooked loadouts for you to take it on with. The Freelance mode is more like the main course. Here, you take on missions that span multiple maps (the game has dozens of gorgeous and detailed maps). At the end of each mission, you'll have to exfiltrate through a spaceport map to get your pay. \n\nWhat to say about the theme and story? I think a lot of people didn't appreciate this, but it was extremely persuasive to me. The planet of Solo Nobre is clearly inspired by the history of US imperialism in South and Central America. The term that best captures what your characters do in the story of the game is \"paramilitary death squad.\" Solo Nobre's left-wing strongman ruler has died, and the forces of interplanetary capitalism are extremely eager to gain access to the planet's markets. To do this, they hire mercenaries (you) to conduct a campaign of violence and destruction, so that they can step into the void of a ruined civil society. If Great Leader's death doesn't lead to civil war by itself, they will buy one.\n\nThe kind of explanatory narration I've used doesn't appear anywhere in the game, though. And why should it? Corporate communications do not speak of \"death squads\" and a nefarious lust for chaos. Instead, the game's story is conveyed by anodyne corporate-speak and unfair contract terms; the larger context appears when you read between the lines. Your employer is called, \"the Solo Nobre Concern (hereafter SNC).\" \"The SNC's development goals for Solo Nobre depend on keeping the local government forces in disarray as long as possible.\" \"We have strong intelligence suggesting that several persons of interest can be found in the refugee camps. ...

An 80's nostalgia electronic sci-fi kaleidoscopic fever dream. This is one of the few games where I don't mute the music after a few hours to insert some other music.\n\nComplaints of difficult controls from other reviewers can generally be mitigated in some fashion by playing different vehicles. Many vehicles have completely different control schemes, and so in some sense it's down to the player to find a vehicle type that they prefer where weapons and controls are concerned. Customizing your vehicle for each mission is critical to your success, and there is no absolute 'right' answer. It's up to you, learn what fits your play style and use it. Experiment with different weapon and vehicle combinations, and if you're pressed for creativity the stand-alone missions will throw you into a mission preset vehicles, weapons, and pilots. The stand-alone missions can be a great way to find your next favourite loadout as you're forced to do as much as you can with often unfamiliar vehicles and weapon combinations. Take your new knowledge into the campaigns and visit entirely new levels of devastation upon your enemies. \n\n The game is a throwback to 90's isometric vehicle destruction games, though it sets itself apart in many ways. Return Fire, Desert Strike, and those sorts of games are obvious inspirations for this game, but they are not the blueprint for the game. Brigador is more like a love letter to those sorts of games, a reminder of what was fun about them, while not being a rehash of those games. If you were the sort that loved destroying everything you could in each level of Jungle Strike, or MechCommander, then this game might just be up your alley.\n\n The campaigns and missions are fairly basic with only the rudiments of objectives, the game concentrates not necessarily on strategic goals, but on the tactical style of combat. Slipping in and out of cover to exchange fire with tough foes, conducting feints to draw enemies away from an objective, flanking an entrenched defence, or using mobility and stealth to devastate the enemy . . . there are a great many play styles that are really up to the player and what they choose for vehicle and weapons. \n\n The game has a lot of lore and story, but I've frankly ignored it all in favour of dropping into campaigns or missions for a half an hour to an hour and blasting everything in a level to rubble. I keep this game installed because the game play is fun and satisfying, even in shorter bursts, and because the level of destruction can be absolutely awe inspiring when you take the time to look at what you've wrought. Everything in a level can be . . . well, leveled. Driving through an apartment block, firing a huge howitzer into a parking lot, machine gunning everything else. The collateral damage in the game is amazing and satisfying. \n\n I use to play King of the Monsters specifically to stomp all over the cities and destroy the buildings, all else was ignored. Rampage also comes to mind. Building stuff can be fun, wrecking stuff can also be great. Revel in destruction!\n\n Playing a mission in a residential area will likely see you devastate the surroundings. Ruins will be left in your wake. Lovingly crafted and detailed ruins. The missions are usually search and destroy with no real caveats where anything else in the environment is concerned. The destruction is fantastic. Wrecking everything is seldom so satisfying (Red Faction Guerilla being another great destruction based game) and it's frankly one of the reasons I keep coming back to this game. The environment isn't just a setting, it's an actor in your self-contained stories of wanton destruction. See an enemy tank a couple blocks away, nestled in a neon lit back alley, with tenement blocks all around you, in the way, hemming you in: drive through the buildings and flush the enemy out, use a penetration weapon like a rail-gun to fire through every obstacle and kill the enemy where he waits, use a mortar to lob death-from-above, zip around the streets and take pot-shots and draw him out, stealth your way up to him and park your gun into his rear, create a nearby distraction to lure him out and slip on by. You have options, and you don't need to exercise them all, find a play style that suits you and go wreck everything.\n\n Much of everything in this game is about earning cash which you use to unlock vehicles, pilots, weapons, and maps. I am not one for high scores or even achievement hunting, but the ease with which the game throws money at you negates any grind for more content, and more about enjoying the game play and discovering new fun tools of destruction. Easy to pop in for a bit and sow the seeds of destruction, laugh gleefully at how terrible of a person you are for destroying an entire city, and then set off on some other adventure.\n\n Sprite based isometric vehicle destruction.

You play a Brigador, a mercenary mech/tank/hoverthing pilot promised a huge paycheck in return for ensuring your mysterious paymasters take control of the city.\n\nGeneral gameplay consists of piloting some form of vehicle through a city with totally destructible terrain. Both you and enemies have directional armour, rewarding flanking, stealth and use of noise. Buildings block line of sight, weapons cause noise both when fired and on impact and enemies will hunt you based on where they last saw or heard you. There's a joy to be had blowing up a fuel station, diving down a side street and waiting for hostiles to investigate then sneaking around and ambushing them from behind.\n\nThe game is split into two parts: Campaign and Freelance. Campaign gives you a linear series of missions, and a choice of four vehicles in each missions, roughly corresponding to easy-very hard difficulties. You're let loose in some sector of the city and leave most of it a smoking wreck.\n\nFreelance, however, is where the game truly comes alive- choose a pilot, choose from an extensive list of vehicles, choose a weapon loadout, then choose a mission. Your pilot sets how difficult your mission will be- from The Auditor, who encounters no enemies whatsoever, to later characters who start at MAX difficulty and stay there. In between, there are several dozen characters with varying difficulty curves, where their difficulties (and payouts) increase for each sector of the city you move through. Vehicles range from monster mechs, to tiny anti-grav hover vehicles. Highlights include a tower of scrap cars on tracks and a motorbike with room for a gun almost its own size. Weapons are lovingly varied and include railguns, chainguns, rockets, artillery and machine guns.\nMissions start you in one district of Solo Nobre, and end when you reach the starport. They range from short jaunts through four outskirts sectors to the 36-sector, no-early-exit behemoth of a mission at the high end. Each district, you are expected to destroy anti-orbital guns, remove officers and cause general havoc.\nI eventually favoured a pair of rapid-fire railguns, on the fastest mech that could support them, sprinting through districts, shooting through buildings and flanking tough enemies. Other times I'd attempt to use a heavy mech wielding cluster artillery- never got the hang of it, but the joy of a single shot clearing most of the screen, buildings and all, never got old.\n\nBrigador is a joy to play, heartily recommended.", "timestamp_created": 1491176771, "timestamp_updated": 1510004870, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score":

This game immedietly struck me as the spiritual successor to that game, it's something I didn't know I wanted but holy hell I'm glad I found it.\n\nSecondly, gameplay. It's deceptively complex and it probably took me about 2 hours of playing to feel comfortable moving around in a vehicle - but there's a reason for that. The range of motion available to you is incredibly in-depth. The guns feel great, managing trajectory is a major component. The AI won't outsmart you, but that's not the point - the game forces you to manage enemies by use of smoke screen, distraction and deception. You can destroy everything, and it can destroy you as well.\n\nThirdly, the soundtrack. If you like SynthWave then you will enjoy the game just for the OST. If you don't know what SynthWave is...it will make sense to you as soon as you hear it. Makes you want to put some god damn mousse in your mullet, do a fat line of cocaine and jump in your Ferrari 512 TR and just speed off into the mother fucking sunset - or in this case - get in your tank made out of a shortbus fitted with a guass cannon and wreak havoc on your piece of shit nation.\n\nYeah yeah it's 20 bucks.

Now, when you think about being a mech pilot you'd usually think Mechwarrior (or Steel Batallion) and naturally, a cockpit view. That's always seems like the way to go with games about giant walking battle machines, but have you ever thought about how much you are missing, with a camera fixed like that? In those 3d games, you are limited either to pilot's cockpit or to your mech's neares vicinity (in 3rd-person mode), with all interesting stuff left out as blips on the radar. Even if you're involved in some close combat, you don't really see more than a handful of enemy machines at once.\n\nIn Brigador, thanks to its isometric perspective, you can see everything around you. You also can take a peek a screen further. You see what you're doing, you see what your enemies are doing, nearly at all times - this allows you to take on lots, lots of enemy mechs at once. [spoiler]And you can also see your enemy unalerted and unsuspecting, which allows you to plan your surprise attack[/spoiler]\n\nRealistic? No [spoiler]Well, nowadays one could imagine using a flying drone for the \"camera\"[/spoiler] Fun? HELL YEAH! It really gives you feeling that a lot is going on.\n\nOf course, you have a single digit chance of winning a battle against 20 or more machines in an open field. There are two things which can help you with that. First, your mech's special abilities: smoke grenades, EMP grenades, thermo-optical camo, audio-kinetic pulse - they differ from machine to machine (and can be swapped). Second, your environment: buildings, industrial facilities, plain old walls, lush forests - these will readilly take a hit for you. At which we come to another cool feature of Brigador - fully destructible environment. You can make a hole in almost any wall, make a nice pathway in any forest, or cork-open some apartment building with a side of your mech. The cool part about this is that destructions are very detailed, as all structures have multiple destructible sections with several damage levels, which surprisingly adds to the feeling of weight of your mech and the destructive power of its weapons. And it's always fun to dissect a factory in a half and see what's inside. But it's not a visual feature only - this allows you to try whatever tactics you want, whether it's luring your enemies out, sneaking up to them, bottlenecking them, retreating from them ASAP, gathering them up near a gas station and blowing it up, you name it.\n\nThe cool part about it is there are almost no encounters dragging on for too long. They are all short and violent, in a matter of a minute you either win, retreat or blow up.\n\nOf course, the amount of possible tactics is limited to two main factors: your machine type and its equipment. Speaking of machines, Brigador goes above and beyond - you have bipedal mechs, hover tanks, normal tanks, armored cars, killdozers, and even a threaded motorcycle! Speaking of equipment, you have three slots: primary, secondary and special ability. Special abilities are limited to 4 types. The guns, however, are plentiful, as you have cannons, laser guns, railguns, howitzers, rocket launchers, mortars, machineguns of different caliber and effect.\n\nSo how to familiarize yourself with all this equipment and figure out best configurations? That's where we approach game modes. Brigador has two of them - campaign mode and freelance mode.\n\nCampaign mode is where you play through the story missions, with 4 pre-defined vehicle configurations available for each. This is a good place to get familiar with all weapons and chassis, as well as the maps (and also earn some money for freelance mode). This is also where we come around the fact that Birgador has very oldschool composition - you select Campaign mode, then select a mission from a list, then select a mech. That's it. The story, if any, is in a text box to the right of the mission. Which is bad. On the other hand, if you're tired and all TL;DR, you can jump straight into action without any obstacles. Which is good. [spoiler]You can always read the story afterwards, after all. You also can unlock more lore and intel from Acquisitions menu[/spoiler]\n\nFreelance mode is where you go all nuts with customization. You hire pilots, buy chassis, buy equipment, unlock missions and engage - pretty much everything you would like to do in a game about mechs. The only complaint here is that missions are procedurally generated and start on the easy side. If you come to freelance fresh from the end of campaign mode, and go with the first suggested pilot, you'll be wondering why all you have to do is fight human targets [spoiler]which of course are no challenge[/spoiler]. That's because the freelance mission difficulty is tied directly to the pilot's stats. So, pay attention to Start Difficulty, Max Difficulty and Increase Per Level stats of the pilots and pick the one that suits your skills.\n\nBoth modes reward you with multiple types of missions - stealth, heavy close quarters combar, hit and run missions, etc. The missions are not all about engaging the enemy, but also about managing your mech. This is especially true for the freelance mode, where you have to clear several goals on several maps in a single mech. Your hull, your shields and your ammo are limited. There are two main ways to restore ammo - from reloading stations on the map (which are guarded), and by scavenging your destroyed enemies (which needs some precision damage control). If you don't blow them up to the bits you can get their ammo and their shields for yourself. This is important to know, as you can easilly be left without any ammo in the middle of your operation. So lots of times you'll have to plan your shootouts and keep some balance during combat, all so you can disable enemy vehicles and get to them to replenish your shileds and guns. Try doing this during a combat with multiple machines for the most hardcore action.\n\nTo make your experience smoother, the game offers rebindable keys for keyboard, and rebindable buttons for your controller (which is a rare find these days)\n\nSpeaking of sound, firing your guns is very, very satisfying. Explosions and destuction sounds are also good. The music in game is your synthwave/retrowave mix - it's very upbeat, compells the gameplay well, and gets you in the mood very quick. Which is all it needs to be.\n\nThere are not to many games in the mech combat genre, and even less games which offer a level of fun, action and attention to detail Brigador offers. It makes even sadder the fact that this game could really use more sales, as at the time of review SteamSpy estimates it to be around 18k. If you ever thought that giant battle machines are cool, you should definetly give Brigador a try.\n\nP.S.

An assortment of weapons (primary and secondary) plus defensive mechanisms, mixed and matched across several different chassis and control schemes.

Not so in Brigador - the mechanics governing a typical mission are diverse and complex. While keeping the game relatively simple to play, you have to constantly take into account all kinds of things - bottlenecks are created and destroyed on the fly, spotter enemies are picked off before a raid, ambushes and distractions are planned and executed on. Flanking is vitally important, as is your elevation level. Ammo depots can go from valuable resources to high-yield explosive device with a click of the mouse button. Cover and concealment, and the difference, frequently comes into play. Enfilade, defilade. You'll have to get used to a wide variety of roles, from tank commander to guerilla warrior to siege strategist to outright dogfighter, to get the most out of this game.\n\nThis game uses tank controls. This makes sense, because tanks and mechs are the main vehicles on offer here. (A-Gravs, with their strafing capability, are high-risk-high-reward affairs which take a bit of time to get used to) Where you're facing is often as important as where you are - many vehicles can't fire with 360-degree freedom. Protect your flank. The shooting also takes gravity and elevation into account, meaning you can overshoot and undershoot. You need to lead targets. You may need half an hour for this to click, but I advise you do - the creators of this game rightfully decided that an atypical game requires slightly atypical handling. Alternate, twin-stick style schemes are available, but you won't get the most out of the game using those.\n\nThe campaign consists of 20-30 10-minute missions. Difficulty selection is achieved in an interesting way by making you use preselected loadouts - in some missions, you may have the ability to step into a roaring goliath of welded-together sedans with a rather warcrime-y chemical weapon launcher and the appropriately named \"K\u00f6nig\" (King) machinegun. Or you can step into a plucky little powersuit barely bigger than the average human and have to turn your brain on a little more. There's a nice variety in the campaign, from cramped urban areas with plenty of collateral damage to very open fields and country clubs, and a few fun little gimmick missions too. Alternatively, Freelance mode gives a wide variety of contracts to choose from and lets you experiment with all the combinations.\n\nThe one thing that keeps this game from being perfect, in my opinion, is freelance mode. It's a lot of fun to experiment with all the loadouts and find your favourite (Pompadour/Pitbull/Parliament/EMP for me, thanks), but the game throws a lot of variables in terms of the game difficulty - your selectable pilot determines the difficulty scaling, and you also select a contract to determine the game length. It's perfect as a sandbox to mess around with, and is no doubt the meat of the game for some people, but if you're looking for a set run-based challenge to slowly learn, you may not really find your sweet spot (and if you do, it probably won't pay out the right amount of money). However, clearing every campaign mission with every loadout more than satisfied me, as far as a set challenge goes.\n\nBut the thing to love most about Brigador, in my opinion, is the sheer amount of craft and character put into everything. The lighting engine really brings the game to life, and the game just packs an insane amount of detail onto the screen with every frame. Each area, each vehicle, each pilot and each weapon has their own unique character. Brigador spares you a dull \"story\" and rather places you into one of videogames' most interesting universes that you can immerse yourself in over and over again. If this game hooks you and you start to get into it, you will probably end up spending all your in-game money on lore, intel and item descriptions instead of anything useful, as I did. Worth every dollar.\n\nA small aside, this game has a ridiculously fantastic soundtrack. Makeup and Vanity Set bring a dark, synthy, gritty sound that fits the action perfectly.

It's fun as hell and offers incredible amounts of replay value and gameplay depth. There is an absolutely enormous amount of content, and everything is packed with detail.\n\nThe basic idea of the game is to pick a vehicle, a primary and secondary weapon, and then a special defensive weapon/feature, and go to town. You're getting paid based on how much destruction you dish out by a cold, calculating megacorp, the SNC, that has only one goal: conquest of Solo Nobre, a massive walled city where the game takes place. You must secure the city district-by-district via whatever means necessary, even if that means completely leveling the entire map (which is totally doable, and even encouraged!).\n\nYou are a Brigador -- basically a mercenary -- offered a contract by the SNC to use your firepower to help bring about the city's fall so that the corporation can swoop in and secure it. The backstory is really interesting, and it is pretty clear you are NOT playing the typical Good Guy\u2122 role here, but it's not black-and-white either. You have to really read between the lines and come up with your own decision on whether you're playing as an opportunistic sociopath, a freedom-fighting liberator, or something in between. The level of detail put into both the story and the game is incredible.\n\n\u25b6 Gameplay\n\nIt's rare these days to find something that feels like it was totally designed around a \"wouldn't it be fun if...\" philosophy. Gameplay is what Brigador is all about, and where it truly shines. While I feel like I've mastered the mechanics, there is still a lot of exploring to do with loadouts. I really like the Randomize button for just that reason, and I often discover variants I wouldn't have picked out on my own. They can be pretty fun, too!\n\nThe feel of each vehicle is unique for the most part, with some overlap in designs between factions, but otherwise they all have a charm of their own and can serve different purposes. Though with the flexibility of the weapon hardpoints and similar weapon types per mount size, it's rare you can't make a vehicle do whatever you really want. Some just excel at certain things more than others.\n\nThe navigation / aiming system is simple and effective, easy to learn yet challenging to master. Sometimes it's tough to land shots on hovering vehicles (agravs) that get right up in your face, but that's one of the agrav's chief advantages: being a tough target to hit. So I think it works in the game's favor. Besides, your weapons are so over-the-top in terms of destructive power it's pretty rare you can't make short work of any single enemy that gets into your personal space. If you can't shoot it, blast the unholy hell out of it with the AK pulse, stomp it, smash it, or run it the hell over. Awesome.\n\nDestruction is plentiful and encouraged as much as possible, which is the best. It sucks to have an environment that is leveled so beautifully and then be penalized for collateral damage. Instead, the opposite happens, and you actually get a payout bonus from your shadowy benefactors based on how much devastation you dish out. Dystopian as all hell, and got a good laugh out of me. Similarly, when I was seeing mention of \"purchase the terms and conditions for more information\" lines, I got a kick out of that too. But then I noticed that you can literally buy access to the terms and conditions of your contract and just about died. It's perfect. And even better, the contract reads believably, too. It's obviously worded in a way that benefits the megacorp over you, but not so much that you wouldn't take the job anyway. After all, for a Brigador, what's a reward without a little risk, right? Superb writing across the board. Though an aside from gameplay, it's a core part of what makes Brigador go from a fun game to a truly fantastic overall experience for me.\n\nManaging difficulty level via the pilot system is clever. When freelancing (i.e. not playing in the structured campaign mode), you pick your loadout, but also your pilot. The pilot determines the difficulty level, and in turn, the payout bonuses (higher difficulty = make better money). It took me a little bit to figure out what was going on, but by the time I'd finished the campaign, it made perfect sense. I only wish you could specify a default pilot, or select a roster for randomizing so that you -- for example -- always stick to the max-diff pilot if you want balls-out challenge every single time. And while it isn't a big deal, lower-tier pilots aren't worthwhile once you have mastered the game. It also doesn't feel like there's a huge amount of difference between pilots, unlike the vehicles and weapons, save for the extremes. I enjoyed unlocking pilots more for the lore than for their function. But for a new player, the difficulty curve is generously gentle. You have a lot of time to get used to things before going all-in, if you ever choose to do so.\n\n\n\u25b6 Visuals\n\nLove them. The amount of detail crammed into each map is astounding considering how BIG they are and how MANY there are. It must have taken ages to finish a single one, let alone all... what, 20+ of them? And while lots of assets are reused frequently, they are done in clever ways so you hardly even notice it. Even though the levels look very similar via the art style, none look like they're the same. Leaving the place littered with persistent debris is a fun, satisfying way to finish a mission.\n\nThe UI is superb as well. I appreciated even the little unnecessary details, like seeing a white dash in the scroll bar if you went past your selection on the page. And I am glad the UI is quick, snappy, and responsive. I hate it when UIs get all fancy but slow down functionality. Not here!\n\n\n\u25b6 Sound\n\nExcellent. Soundtrack is fantastic, SFX are great. All the gun sounds feel about right. Vehicle movement sounds are good, though the large mech footfalls seem a bit weak. Sounds like they're stepping on crunchy grass rather than dropping tons of force onto the ground.\n\nThe music is wonderful, but it doesn't play forever! It seems to fade out completely once you complete all objectives. Sometimes I like to fly around and just destroy stuff (because it's so satisfying to level everything), and it isn't as fun when there's only silence. Fortunately, you can buy the soundtrack which includes everything ingame and some extras, and just play that in the background with Winamp or what have you. Problem solved!\n\n\n\u25b6 Modding\n\nThe game is moddable via the developer console! While it's not always easy, it's fantastic that you can change so many aspects of the gameplay if you want. Everything from the weapons enemy units pack to damage values to numbers of enemies on the field to sound effects.\n\nI'd just about exhausted all the difficulty the game has to offer out-of-the-box when I discovered the dev console, and now it's like a whole new game for me with near-limitless replay value.\n\nModding is not always easy, and it involves permanent edits to the assets.pack game file if you don't want to lose your changes when you quit. If you screw something up, you can end up crashing the game constantly and be unable to fix it without verifying game files in Steam to redownload the .pack and start from scratch (though your profile will be unaffected). So it's a good idea to make regular backups if you get into modding. But the devs are still working on the game, too, and are also trying to make modding even easier for us, which is fantastic. They also want to release a level editor, which would be HUGE.\n\nOverall? Absolutely get it if you are interested. Chances are, you'll find a way to enjoy the game, and if it gets too easy for you (which seems to be rare for most players), you can crank it up to absurd degrees with the dev console. The soundtrack and audiobook are also worth a grab, so I say get the full package.

It's a relatively charming game, it looks nice and the OST is great, what writing there is, has a bit of humour to it, and is generally quite well-done, but the fact of the matter is that there are really only two missions or so to play.\n\nSure, they vary the levels, the loadouts and the enemies but... it's basically all the same. I think there's essentially all of one mission that flips things a bit(by having you start with no ammo), but that's as imaginative as the creators get. Every mission is about blowing up X items that are either mobile or stationary, and fighting back or not fighting back. You pick a mech and its loadout, you're off to the races, and then ten minutes later you're back at the menu.\n\nAnd there's about 25 missions of this, so ultimately not much actual game unless you count the pretty boring \"freelance\" mode that has even less context to make things interesting, or the fact that you have four different potential loadouts for a given mission as varied options.\n\nAdditionally, the controls feel a bit rough at times(the facing seems weirdly unwilling to automatically face the way you're going, so you often have to manually wrangle it into place), and it's sometimes hard to tell what you're actually going to hit. Not a problem because there are any friendlies or neutrals you mustn't blow up, but just sort a bit annoying in terms of actually hitting badguys before they hit you.\n\nSo, really, if the game and OST were ten bucks combined, I'd call it a good deal. At any higher price, unless they're planning to expand with a LOT more free content(and not just more of the same, but stuff that actually VARIES the missions and setups in interesting ways), it's not very well-priced for what you're getting.\n\nI WOULD like to see more content from the creators, though, and if they make any more games, I'd likely give them a shot, because the writing suggests that they've got good ideas.", "timestamp_created": 1487699605, "timestamp_updated": 1487699605, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.544925", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30043423": {"recommendationid": "30043423", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085516442", "num_games_owned": 104, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 7875, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501899775}, "language": "english", "review": "Excellent retro isometric gameplay, along with a 80's retro newwave synth soundtrack, dark and vibrant blade runnerish visuals and plently of extensive lore bits and scifi tropes, Brigador is a must play for sci fi fans and mech enthusist alike.

That and the isometric view makes it look not all too engaging, but its gameplay is addictive on the level of Hotline Miami. (The soundtrack is of the same high caliber too)  Still a bit dark, but then again cyberpunk aesthetics are supposed to be dark, and this game is very much in the tradition of cyberpunk.\n\nBrigador is a twin stick shooter of sorts that feels closest in my mind to Hotline Miami, so I'll be making some comparisons here and there to maybe give a better idea of the gameplay if you've played those games. Campaign mode comprises of stages, and the story of revolution in the streets of Solo Nobre is told through text dumps on the mission select scenes. You can select a variety of mechs with different weapons and abilities and proceed to destroy. A lot. Leave nothing unblemished by the foot (Or treads if you prefer that) of your revolutionary death machine. At the end of each mission there is of course a scoreboard of sorts that shows how much damage you have caused... for the cause. There is also a free play mode and there seems to be a lot of unlockable mechs and missions to give you something to do after you complete the campaign mode. The game I would say is aiming for the kind of arcade replayability.\n\nThe game has a punishing level of difficulty, and you will die a lot. Sometimes it feels as though the controls are sometimes at fault for some of the deaths you'll receive. The mechs function with tank controls, being able to move backwards while facing forwards for example, and aiming is done via the mouse. This is initially difficult to get used to, and I still feel as though the aiming doesn't feel as accurate as it should be, but eventually you'll get the hang of it. There are also various options to fine tune the control and change how it handles, but I've mostly settled on the default controls. \n\nUnlike Hotline Miami, the action is much more slower. You definitely do feel as though you are controlling a mech, and debris and buildings will impede your movement and firing. There's definitely an expectation of strategic thinking and even stealth to be had, as blindly rushing in guns blazing will oftentimes lead towards a quick death by swarms of multiple enemy mechs. Depending on your loadout, your mech can aim far, and I think it's better to take out enemies from afar than from up close, though if you feel confident enough, you certainly can just try to crush your enemies like they were buildings (There are mechs that specialize in up close assaults) \n\nPositioning also matters a lot. Attacking from behind or from the side does more damage than a full frontal assault, and of course this applies to your mech as well. Of course, there are plenty of nice buildings that can serve as impromptu cover for your mech. Your ammo is also finite, and care should be taken before unloading it all lest you find yourself out of ammo with a group of loyalist mechs hot on your tail, though you can find recharge stations and occasional enemy drops.  All this coupled up makes for a rather neat style of combat that feels like there can be something like on the fly strategic thinking to be had in your assaults. \n\nThe music for this game is all synthwave stuff by Makeup & Vanity Set, someone I haven't heard of prior to this game but just from this game, is someone I should listen to more. \n\nThe music fits the cyberpunk mecha destruction going on pretty well. The soundtrack DLC is definitely something you should pick up if you like synthwave, and it comes with 32 tracks and an audiobook which I have not heard at this time, but is apparently good from what other people are saying, and the fact that they offer an audiobook should tell you something about how the devs care about the story in this game. \n\nI haven't finished this game yet, but I can feel confident in recommending this game for anyone who likes mech combat games with a dark gritty cyberpunk aesthetic coupled with great synth tunes.", "timestamp_created": 1486918862, "timestamp_updated": 1486918862, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29868166": {"recommendationid": "29868166", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020559024", "num_games_owned": 325, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 671, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510001505}, "language": "english", "review": "\"GREAT LEADER HAS FALLEN.\nLIBERATE SOLO NOBRE.

You play a mercenary hired by offworld interests that want to exploit the situation.\n- A freelance mode that lets you play with your own combination of pilot, vehicle, and weapons on the operation of your choosing.\n- Your choice of pilot affects the difficulty level minimum and maximum, and how it scales across the maps, as well as your final payout.\n- A ton of great looking and interesting vehicles. My favorite style are the Corvid vehicles which are repurposed junk war machines like the Killdozer and a giant stack of rolling cars named the Treehouse.\n- A wide variety of weaponry and a handful of special equipment to equip your vehicles with.\n- The writing is so impressive. It's a well-realized world and the write-ups of the pilots, the technology, the locations, and everything is so well-done.\n- The music is really the first thing I was blown away by.

Between the three vehicle types, mechs and tanks make slight sense and the hover vehicles make NO sense (the control direction is ENTIRELY relative to where the mouse is pointing, which is simply hoirrible).  Aiming is terribly inconsistent; you can have the cursor directly over a target and shots won't do anything; conversely, some shots will hit anything in their path, but there's no indication of why.  So it's a shooter where movement sucks and aiming is uncertain, but the enemies have no trouble hitting you.\n\nIn short, it's a recipe for consistent annoyance and frequent misery, given that every map is an enormous mass of obstacles that bring you to a screeching halt if you don't avoid them and the devs decided to give you some of the most tremendously bad controls imaginable.  The challenge of the game is not beating the enemies, it's simply trying to make any sense whatsoever of these wretched controls.\n\nThere is utterly, utterly no reason whatsoever that WASD shouldn't move the player in the logical directions and the mouse aims, other than the devs decided not to bother with thinking up any sort of creative ways to put difficulty in the game.  It's a standard control scheme for a top-down shooter at this point for the simple reason THAT IT WORKS and it doesn't drive players insane.\n\nI would enjoy this game quite a bit if the controls were anything resembling modern, workable controls, but it ends up being a huge fatal flaw that saps all the enjoyment out of the game.  It's in no way a matter of \"learn to play\" difficulty, and 100% an issue of bad design.\n\nUPDATE: Devs responded to my criticisms of the game and politely pointed out the (somewhat buried) option to change the orientation of the controls (there are multiple control types for the different vehicles, you gotta know that \"screen absolute\" is the antigrav option that actually makes some sense and isn't miserable).\n\nImproved my experience enormously, and I would readily recommend the game at this point without any reservation.

Once you wrap your head around the controls, it feels great.  An isoMECHtric camera angle blends the fun of an old school shooter with strategic maneuvers. There's two primary game modes in Brigador, campaign and freelance.  The campaign introduces you to the concepts of the game. Pick a mech/vehicle, slap guns on, and go destroy. Going more in depth there are several different vehicles all with pros and cons. Tank like vehicles and some bipedal mechs use tank controls, it might feel strange at first. There's also free controlling vehicles that give it more of a twin stick vibe. \n\nIn the campaign you choose a mission and one of five pre-selected mechs. The missions themselves don't vary too much. It's more the loudout you pick that has an effect on completing the same objective in a different way. The selected mechs make it less of an undertaking. It's easy to jump in and see what works for you. Completing four missions unlocks four more and so on. It also nets you money that can be spent in the games more customizable mode, freelance.\n\nEvery loadout has a primary, secondary, and special weapon with a cooldown. Your primary and secondary take ammo that can be gathered at support stations or off dead enemies. There are several different types including gaiting guns, lasers, and cannons. Each one with an ammo cap and specific stats rate of fire, power, etc.  The special weapons are reserved for a more tactical approach. Smoke can obscure a group of enemies view allowing you to light them up, or active camo to sneak up on your targets before they raise an alarm. Depending on what kind of vehicle your using you have either a bull rush or stomp to get through any pesy buildings in your way.\n\nFreelance mode is where you'll spend currency from your campaign. Every aspect is customizable in freelance mode. Your pilot determines the min/max amount of difficulty on missions. The base of your vehicle for how you want it to control. And of course primary, secondary, and special weapons. Even the missions cost currency to unlock. Thankfully the campaign is very generous with money, as well as being replayable.  Freelance modes missions work much like the campaigns, but it has a heavy focus on how to approach them that keeps things interesting.\n\nBrigador is not an easy game by any means.  Most of my time was spent with a mouse and keyboard.  It does have game pad support, but I found the precision of a mouse kept me alive a little longer. Another thing that did make things a little easy to understand was game speed. The game speed option in the menu is incredible for just understanding movement patterns. I found a comfort zone around 75 and slowly bumped it up. Just to clarify, everything in the game slows down including you.\n\nThe soundtrack has a heart throbbing 80's synth vibe. It's probably one of my favorite OST's. It's great and making you feel relaxed, but then intense if things start to go bad.

This game involves simply infiltrating a sector and annihilating the living hell out of everything you see. The key with this game is its plethera of play styles. There are close to a hundred vehicles and even more weapons that can be interchanged to match your ideal super action playstyle.\n\nThe main reason I wanted to post this was the main complaint featured in the negative comments about this game: the controls. Many of the mechs in this game feature TANK CONTROLS which is very different than the standard WASD, left moves left, etc. control scheme.

[Trenched, oops I mean Iron Brigade without tower defense] Also I was vaguely reminded of Judge Dredd and Far Cry Blood Dragon\n[/list]\n[h1]Exposition, Concurrence and Summation[/h1]\n\n[b]Brigador[/b] is ostensibly a twin stick shooter, at least in terms of quickly describing it. It starts out with some rather overwhelming tutorials regarding the various types of mechs, tanks and hovercrafts. Each controlled very differently however in the options there are various control schemes. And unless you're adept at quickly acquiring targets whilst using tank controls, meaning forward is relative to the orientation of the mech I highly suggest switching the controls to Screen absolute. Essentially making it behave like a twin stick shooter except for the really small turret ones that can't turn all the way around. \n\nThere is a number of other tweaks such as being able to toggle the forward facing function to follow the mouse or crosshair automatically rather than needing to hold it as you move about. \n\nThere are buildings aside from the objectives such as comm towers and other resource type things that as an example, when destroyed, will have less enemies spawn if the city is alerted. As well as have the guard barriers not erect as soon. But in my experience I never really had a real reason to do so. I basically looked for the tower holding the type of ammo I had and where it was on the map and just kept that in mind. In fact, due to it keeping track of each vehicle for each level, you get to know each map pretty well. You have to be pretty fast and loose especially with smaller mechs whilst being conservative and trying not to dive directly into enemy territory. \n\nIn my honest gut feeling. I think this game may have been better served as a rogue-like. Using the money to upgrade your own customized mech from the get go as you trounce through Sola Nobre rather than save that aspect for the freelance mode which feels a lot like an afterthought. \n\nHowever, in freelance mode. There is still a definite progression. The difficulty and rewards being affected by the pilot and mission choice and each chassis being able to equip a variety of weaponry to your liking. All must be requisitioned by purchasing with money earned from completing other missions or indeed through failure by which far less money is earned. \n\nSomething I really like however is the fact that each weapon has a unique arc. The weapons as well as vehicles both traverse and react with the environment in very interesting ways. For instance, if you're using a weapon like a mortar, not only is your aim affected by the direction of the mech or vehicle but by the inertia of it as well; Reflected in the targeting beam. \n\n[b]THE GIST\nThis game is extremely pleasing and very interesting to look at. It can be very fun especially when used as a what I'd call a \u201cpodcast\u201d game (though it does have a very nice OST) I just feel like something is missing from keeping it from being the glorious game it could be.[/b] \n\n[url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/25764029/][i]Follow my curation for more[/i][/url]", "timestamp_created": 1484359460, "timestamp_updated": 1485644094, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.636276", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29213476": {"recommendationid": "29213476", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992101032", "num_games_owned": 155, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 1808, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491249524}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]Getting really tactical and operator with the robots, and tanks, and hovering robots[/h1]\n\nFully destructible environment, which actually matters. \nLots of different mechs, tanks and weapons to choose from, some causing massive erections and leveling cities - at once. \nTailoring difficulty to your liking, with higher difficulties offering higher payout. \nOnce you get around the basics, like which buildings blow up (very important) and which robots fuck you up the hardest or are able to outright one-shot you (expect many ragequits over this and ninja suicide bombers), the game becomes highly addictive and replayable with custom kinda-randomized missions. \nAiming especially feels so damn good once you master it, just landing those artillery shots, oh boy, or equipping double BRRRT Gatling guns - the gun sounds and sounds in general are also really great. \nGame being tactical focused doesn't mean there aren't situations where you just hold both triggers and pray for your life or desperately try to hide with the cloak ability.

You have a light machine gun mounted to one arm, a light-caliber cannon in the other, a stolen Spacer camo system, and an Opportunity. Nobody knows you're there. Your targets are waiting in a country chalet. Overwhelming firepower guards them. You have made entrance to the district undetected, and you have an overview of the situation, courtesy of your employers. You sneak through the forest, knock down a hedge with your legs, forge your own path. You are still undetected. An enormous tank idles in front of the villa; its hardshields are lowered. They weren't expecting you. You aim between the trees, put an 84mm Carlos round in it, and it comes out the other side. The tank stops idling. Two scout vehicles approach from the other direction, attracted by the noise. You pepper them with 8mm Bonesaw rounds and they stop investigating. Your Carlos's autoloader slams a new shell into the breech and locks. You put your second cannon round of the day through the palatial house, blasting it to smithereens. Heavy tanks approach from the east. You flip the switch on your optic camo system; it buzzes to life, and you disappear into the underbrush. Three more targets to go.\n\nYou are Arturo Nemi, to make it simple; your body came with that name. You are a Brigador piloting an Arlo. Your Auxilliary hardpoint is fitted with a Broiler multi-discharge laser. Your Small hardpoint is fitted with a Black Hand. Something resembling a megaphone on steroids is fitted to the side mount. You like it that way. It's flexible. Your contract is freeform: it requires you to do as much damage as possible to forward the SNC's interests, which happen to align with your own. You cruise *through* the slums of Solo Nobre, using your agrav's hull to smash a tunnel towards your objective.  A running tally of casualties and your payout for same updates in the corner of your vision. You're going for the big money, though. An orbital gun towers in front of you; mechs and agravs surround it. You close in behind a wall, and activate your audiokinetic pulse; you hear a tremendous echoing roar, bouncing off everything around you, and the orbital gun and everything around it start to crumble, followed immediately by an echoing explosion. You hear loud footsteps, approaching rapidly from around a corner, and aim your Black Hand at the wall; you see nothing, but a crackling hiss emits from it as you command it to fire. You watch with detached interest as the civilians running from your machine slump over, twitching and screaming, and the mechanical footsteps become erratic and stop. You pull around the corner and blast the stragglers' hulls to pieces with your Broiler. Three more guns to go.\n\nYou are Johnny Five Aces, legend of the timestream, renowned pilot of every sort of vehicle, legendary shot with a revolver, and renowned dapper gentleman. You are driving a Treehouse, a terrifying agglomeration of cars and tanks, thirty feet tall. You have a Ploughman 132mm chemical munitions launcher, aimed by a pair of steering wheels on your left, and a K\u00f6nig 30mm rotary autocannon (known by another name, long ago), aimed by another pair on your right; you also have a smoke grenade launcher, but hiding is for dishonorable cowards. You grind your way into a necropolis, turning tombstones to powder underneath your treads. A scout spots you, and radios for backup. Dozens of huge walkers and heavy tanks come into view, bringing their guns to bear. You hold down the trigger of your K\u00f6nig and furiously crank the traverse across them, filling them with depleted uranium. You hear a series of deafening cracks, and another, closer one from your hardshields as your generator shorts out; pivoting your vehicle, you see Mantis mechs, Loyalists with Galinha railguns, already far too close, followed by Touros and a few Mongoose pilots in suits. You aim the Ploughman at the Mantises, fire, and advance into the ominous white cloud toward the mechs behind them. A horrible creak emits from below you, as your Treehouse starts to melt; you've made a terrible mistake. The windshield of the station wagon-turned-cockpit pits and flows away, dissolved by the Tubar\u00e3o; you are next, as the vapor drifts into your cockpit. Like a ball pushed off the edge of a cliff, you scream as the Treehouse is transformed back into the raw materials it was built from (scrap metal). You will never see Nina again, nor engage in cosmos-shattering intercourse with her, because you have died.\n\nWelcome, Brigador.\n\nBrigador's controls take a little while to get used to, especially if you haven't played an isometric game in a long time.

The lore is both fascinating and well-written; the pilots have bios, the weapons and vehicles have intel summaries written like a technical manual, and there's plenty of other information to unlock as you earn the money to do so.

Which pilot do you want, as they set the spawn lists? - and there's also the option to turn down the game speed to up to 50% its normal pace, making the breakneck speed of the fights a little slower and giving you more room to think and breathe.\n\nThe game's play modes are wide - lots of options available to you that don't take a long time to complete individually - but there's a ton of depth to the actual raw play experience. As such, whether you want a deep experience you can really dive into, or something to play for twenty minutes before work, the game can do that.\n\nOverall, I can't recommend the game enough. It's fantastic, one of my single most played games ever. There's so much here, in terms of content: dozens of vehicles, dozens of weapons, dozens of levels, and if you don't like one, you can try another, and another. I've basically beaten the game, or near enough, but I still come back again and again to play it some more, even though there's nothing left to unlock.", "timestamp_created": 1483901042, "timestamp_updated": 1483901042, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29110383": {"recommendationid": "29110383", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970797658", "num_games_owned": 382, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2761, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499141622}, "language": "english", "review": "Brigador is a surprisingly deep isometric action game - it appears to be a twin-stick shooter at first but it actually has full three-dimensional aiming and tank controls, which is important because your facing determines how much damage you take from enemy fire.

Lots of different weapons with different characteristics and firing arcs, three types of vehicles that all control very differently, and a stable of special abilities like smoke grenades, active camouflage, and emp grenades all give this game a ton of replayability.

It's been a while since I've played an isometric shooter similar to (and at the same time being as good as) Brigador.  When I first saw this game on my \"games to keep an eye on\" radar, I instantly thought of GT Interactive's [i][b]Bedlam[/b][/i] from waaaaaay back in '96. So, I finally got around to buying it, and it took me a little time to \"settle in\", as it were, but since then I've become addicted! After having played Brigador for a few hours, I must say... YES! FINALLY!\n\nI've always thought isometric shooters/brawlers that are set to this scale are really cool if they stick to and expand upon the genre-defining gameplay mechanics that can make these games so much fun to play. \n\nFirst of which (in my mind) is [b]fully destructable environments(!)[/b]. Acknowledging that every on-screen asset can be smashed, crushed, vaporised or blown into even smaller pixels gives one a great deal of satisfaction! [i]King of the Monsters[/i], the aforementioned [i]Bedlam[/i], a little sprinkling of [i]Mech Commander 2[/i] and the somewhat recent [i]Kaiju-A-GoGo[/i] have all given me a similar feeling gameplay wise. Visually, these games are nowhere near the same level of detail as Brigador (obviously), since most of these titles are quite dated in this day and age. It's just more proof that the current number of games in this somewhat niche genre is sorely lacking, unfortunately. \n\nSecond most important (IMHO); a fully fleshed-out world with unique locales/scenery/whatnot (that you will, again, inevitably destroy along the way... muahahahaha!).\n\nBrigador has all of this, en masse! The campaign is reasonably long and with a decent storyline. There's also endless mayhem to be had playing in freelance mode, earning money from missions that you can then spend on customising your mech, a-grav or tracked vehicle. Choose pilots (each with their own interesting bio), primary and secondary weapons, defensive loadout, mission area(s) and you're good to go! Then there's the soundtrack... I'm a sound designer/engineer by trade, so... someone restrain me before I write another paragraph of text.\n\nCritique? Personally, I have none with Brigador (I may be biased). It has lived up to and gone beyond my expectations for something I purchased during this years winter sale. I cannot deny that I read other reviews and comments about the control scheme being \"unintuitive\" before I bought it. As I mentioned earlier, I freely admit that it took me a few minutes to get used to movement and firing in Brigador, even after having tried every configuration available in the setup menu coupled together with my brains vast mech gaming experience that has been accumulating in my cranium since the early 80's. I ended up going back to using the default control scheme, as I believe one should really try playing a game the way the developer intends it to be played.

I mean, 70 on metacritic, come on !\n\nBrigador remind me a good deal of some games who were pretty good : Future cop LAPD, Crusader no remorse/regret and, of course, Mechwarrior.\nAnd that's a very good thing, because I loved those games !\n\nI heard of Brigador completly by accident by first seeing a .webm on a certain chinese basket weaving imageboard. That little video clip lasted less than 10 secondes but I was blown away by how cool and good looking that game seemed to be, I had to try it and I wasn't disappointed. Oh no !\n\nFirst of all, Brigador is incredibly gorgeous. The designers really made an excellent job on all the vehicules and the maps.\nI can only regret the absence of an in game zoom to bath myself in those gorgeous pixels (I know you can zoom in via the dev console, but it's far less intituitive than just mouse scroll to control the zoom level whenever you want).\n\nSecond of all, The music is really nice. I mean really, REALLY nice. Makeup and Vanity Set not only made an excellent soundtrack but it also fit the game ambiance incredibly well.\n\nAnd finally, the difficulty : the game pretty much let you decide how hard you want it to be. You're not too good ? Choose the biggest vehicle in the campaign or in Freelance, jump into the Lowmill equiped with a K\u00f6ning and a Chieftain + AK pulse and watch everything melt before your eyes in a very satisfying manner.\nWant some unreasonable challenge ? Jump into the Varlet (once unlocked, that can honestly take some time) equipped with a Blackhand and Lockdown to sneak your way between enemy vehicle that will blast you to oblivion with pathetic ease.\n\nGranted, the game takes a little time to adapt to it's peculiar movement and aiming but it's all worth it. Hell, even the tidbits of lore you unlock are great, the universe is interesting and the lore behind the vehicle and weapons is written well enough to make it engaging. On a sidenote, I was quite amused by how ANCAP this universe is, you seriously have to BUY the terms and agreements of YOUR contract. Nevertheless, breaking the NAP has never been more fun.\n\nIf I had a little critic to do it's about the aiming, when it's blasting and exploding everywhere it's not always very easy to clearly see where you're aiming and it's quite a problem with slow shooting weapons. The same problem applies to shooting AGRAV, depending on their orientation it's either very easy to shoot them or very painful.\nOh, well this little trouble is easily forgotten in the face of such an amazing game.", "timestamp_created": 1483492987, "timestamp_updated": 1511647087, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543568", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28991384": {"recommendationid": "28991384", "author": {"steamid": "76561198304831822", "num_games_owned": 25, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4838, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512580658}, "language": "english", "review": "I feel obligated to write a review for this game. I can't really say much that hasn't already been said, however I will say that Brigador is simply incredible. The setting is a unique take on a sort of cyberpunk-corporate-dystopia, which reminds me of films such as Bladerunner, or Alien, among others. The soundtrack has a synth-heavy pulse that matches the mood and visuals of the game perfectly, quite similar to soundtrack work by John Carpenter, or Tangerine Dream, which seems fitting given the dark futuristic world of Brigador. The aesthetics of the game are damned-near perfect to me.\n\nGameplay has a bit of a learning curve, I will admit. I was lumbering around in my starting mech, fairly lost as to how to wrangle in the big bastard... But after a few tweaks of the controller layout in the options I was good to go, and never looked back. Aside from that, combat feels great, annihilating everything in my path with an Otomo laser is just rewarding as hell. Blasting thru affluent neighborhoods with a Zeus railgun never felt more RIGHT, ever. Just the staggering amount of variety in vehicles, weapons, and auxiliary equipment make the game very re-playable. Combine that with the freelance mode, and I'm sure I'll be putting in at least another 28 hours into Brigador, if not countless more.\n\nLastly, I'll touch on 2 things: The graphics, and the lore of the game. The graphics are insanely detailed, and the isometric world incredibly realized. The game devs really nailed the look in this one, it's got character for days. I really can't do it justice in words how beautifully crafted this gritty world truly is. Secondly, the lore is fascinating, I find myself reading every bit of info on each new mech, agrav, weapon, pilot, you name it, simply to immerse myself in, and understand this world even more. It really is well done, to me anyway. The little touches, bits of Intel, and back-story, really give you the sense of care that went into this game.

I expect lots of buildings and tanks and people to tower over, and I expect to stomp them with reckless abandon. Brigador understands this, appreciates this, and serves it up with exactly one caveat: It will not be reckless. You will annihilate columns of tanks, regiments of infantry, and entire city blocks, but only if you are careful and smart about it. In other words, they took the concept of mechs and made what could be the best possible game with them.\n\nBrigador opens with harsh neon, heavy synth, and the words GREAT LEADER IS DEAD - SOLO NOBRE MUST FALL. Indeed, the brutal dictator of a remote colony world is no more, and a certain megacorp is paying big bucks to make sure no one fills the vacuum he left. That's where you come in, taking on lucrative contracts to destroy the city's defenses and infrastructure, wipe out the factions vying for control, and crush every last vestige of Great Leader's reign. It's a big job, and luckily you have a mind-boggling assortment of mechs, tanks, hoverships, and giant-ass guns to get it done.\n\nIf this setup sounds dystopian as fuck to you, you're in the right place. Solo Nobre is the quintessential cyberpunk hellhole and it makes all the difference in the world to the feel of the game. The maps you'll be stomping across are cluttered industrial parks, blocks of neon bars and dives, posh walled communities, muddy slums of lean-tos and row houses, necropolises of towering stone mausoleums and unmarked graves, and bustling, shining spaceports. Every road and building and tree is rendered in incredible, pixel-perfect detail just like they used to do in those halcyon days of SVGA 2D games.\n\nAll of this is here for you to level the absolute shit out of. Every mission is a contract between you and the Solo Nobre Concern (complete with delicious legalese flavor text) to take out important targets such as orbital guns, enemy captains, or statues of Great Dead Leader. You'll start in one corner of the map in your chosen vehicle, and you'll have to make your way through the dense cityscape and dozens of enemy units to take it out. Literally everything is destructable, from the tallest buildings to the tiniest bench.\n\nIt's the perfect setup for mayhem but like I mentioned, you have to be smart about it. Brigador is not the arcadey playground it may appear, because stomping around and blasting mindlessly will get you killed very, very fast. Depending on your chosen mech you may or may not be the toughest thing on the field, but you'll always be outnumbered. Fortunately, Brigador has some of the most well-designed enemy behavior ever seen in a game like this. While you enjoy an isometric birds-eye view, your enemies all rely on lines of sight, audio cues, and a little bit of patrolling logic. Charging into battle head-on will get you blown away but you can actually sneak behind high walls, crouch behind trees and containers, distract enemies with remote explosions, lose them in twisting streets, and even trick them into blowing each other up.\n\nYou have plenty of tools to accomplish all this, but they are limited in use. Your vehicle carries two weapons with limited ammo, a defensive option like smoke shells or optical cloak on a cooldown, and a melee attack like stomping or bull rushing. Every resource must be used to get through missions, to keep enemy groups manageable or to escape a trap or just to not run out of ammo. There are depots around the map to refill the four possible kinds of ammo, and enemies drop pickups as well, but your base pool is usually limited so you need to make every shot count. That can be tricky with the surprisingly technical aiming system that takes into account firing arcs and momentum, but once you get the hang of it every dead-on howitzer shell is going to feel like Christmas.\n\nEven trickier is going to be the movement system, and this is likely where the steepest learning curve is. All of your movement with WASD is relative to your vehicle's facing, not the screen. It's tank controls not seen since the heady days of Crusader: No Remorse and to be fair, it gives you just as fine control here as it does there. But honestly this control scheme died out for a reason, because it's just harder to process than screen-relative or absolute controls. The developers wisely understand this and have added options not only for absolute controls but ALSO for slowing down the game itself to give time to process the moves you want to make. Personally I've been sticking with the original settings and while I'm still warming up to them, I've gotten through a lot of missions with them.\n\nOn the subject of gameplay, you'll be hard-pressed to run out if you dig the mech-mayhem on offer here. There's a lengthy campaign that starts with some decent tutorials that cover JUST the basics and then spirals off into contracts to wipe out commanders and whole districts of enemies. Each mission offers four pre-set loadouts to use of varying challenge levels, but overall the game gets HARD by the halfway point. Brigador does not hold back in any way; I've dealt with a mission where you start with no ammo in a cramped space with one-shot suicide rockets, and a mission where you have to get past an army of huge sentry bots in little more than a motorcycle. They're viciously difficult and took like 20 tries to beat, but honestly I can't say I didn't enjoy every attempt, blowing up and dying in exciting new ways every time.\n\nThe campaign earns you money to unlock new assets in freelance mode, which is honestly where you should be spending most of your time. Freelance mode puts every single mech, tank, a-grav, gun, defense option, and pilot at your disposal to remix into whatever chaotic monstrosity you want to challenge yourself with. With enough money you can build acid-launching chicken walkers, mortar-slinging party vans, microwave-shooting motorbikes, and towering amalgamations of cars topped with train cannons. These can be sent into multi-map contracts where your ammo and damage carry over between maps, and sometimes you can cash out early if things go south. It's a thrilling and almost overwhelming mode because of all the choices you have and new combinations to learn, but it will last you literally forever.\n\nAll of this is wrapped in one of the slickest, most cohesive packages I have ever seen. Brigador deserves accolades for a lot of things but nothing as much as their absolutely spot-on cyberpunk dystopia. Solo Nobre is fully realized as a functional, logical hell of corporate interests and guerilla intrigue, fleshed out with well-written snippets of lore and dialogue for every contract, map, vehicle, and faction in the game. The graphics evoke the best parts of dark, powerful technology crashing against human concerns, and the throbbing synth soundtrack is the ultimate icing on the neon cake. Wherever you're coming from, whether it be Blade Runner or Ghost in the Shell or Shadowrun, you're going to feel at home, and you aren't going to want to leave. Brigador is the perfect intersection of mech combat, dystopian themes, and technical gameplay, forming a title that really should be seen as a landmark in the genre.\n\n\n\nDid you enjoy this review?

They made Brigador even better and I didn't think that was possible. I don't think I'll ever be uninstalling this game.\n\nBrigador is the isometric mech game I never knew I wanted and it delivered on nearly all fronts. I have very few complaints about this game. It knows how to make a person feel like they\u2019re piloting a big, intimidating mech, capable of destroying everything around it, but the other vehicles know how to deliver a great experience too. This game is a well-rounded package that should please many people.\n\nFirst off, the killer soundtrack by Makeup and Vanity Set is amazing. It alone might be worth the price of the OST + Audiobook edition for some people. The tunes immerse you in the 80\u2019s and make the entire experience of tactically or recklessly destroy specific buildings and groups of enemies really pleasant. Prepare to hear synth and electronic instruments that fit the game like a glove. You can expect to own 24 songs across two volumes and another 8 in the EP folder.\n\nBrigador has a 21 mission campaign that has had more missions added to it since the developer loves updating its game. The whole thing should take around 4 hours if you play to beat it without trying to use all the vehicles for each map. Each mission allows you to choose from a pool of four vehicles that offer different playstyles and difficulty. The mechs can brace themselves for punishment and take a beating while the Party Van needs to have a nimble pilot to stay alive. I definitely preferred the heavier vehicles that could take a beating since I couldn\u2019t grasp \u201cmaneuver warfare.\u201d\n\nSome of the vehicles were beyond my skill level on the default settings, but that didn\u2019t bother me. I wanted to keep playing the game at 100% speed and became used to the controls quickly enough since it felt like an isometric Mechwarrior game. Those tank controls are what I found easiest to use to make sure I kept my front towards my enemy since facing plays an important role in staying alive. Letting the faster enemies flank you usually means death or sustaining a huge amount of damage. Feel free to tinker with the options if you have trouble though since the developer made accommodations for other players with different control schemes and the ability to adjust the speed of the game from 60-100%. You can also use a controller with the game.\n\nThe gameplay itself is satisfying and challenging. Stray bullets damage the environment, leaving parts of the map completely demolished depending on the kind of player you are. You have to account for facing, weapon arcs + momentum, positioning, enemy type since the fast ones love to flank, and when to use your defensive ability which can be active camo or a destructive pulse wave. You can even use explosions to lure the enemy to that area while you make your escape or prepare a devastating ambush. The huge weapon variety keeps the game from becoming stale as different vehicles have different loadouts. Vehicles come equipped with two regular weapons, a defensive/special ability, and one or two utility skills depending on the type. For example, Mechs can stomp on the ground or crouch to significantly reduce damage.\n\nAs you can imagine, buildings and enemies don\u2019t stand a chance against all the firepower and the game makes it all look good. I love using artillery that splits into more projectiles that completely wipe out city blocks. It\u2019s quite the sight. Everything can be destroyed except the ground and district walls which usually mark the borders of the huge maps. It\u2019s extremely satisfying and slightly irresponsible to let loose on enemies behind cover with high environmental damage weapons like artillery, chain guns, or other heavy weapons. Just make sure you leave some buildings standing for yourself in case of a tactical retreat. There are plenty of environments to demolish too that go beyond the campaign mode.\n\nFreelance and Acquisitions mode go hand in hand. Every dollar you earn in the campaign or Freelance goes to unlocking things in Acquisitions which means more stuff for experimentation in Freelance unless you\u2019re buying Lore. For your convenience, you can also unlock new items while in the Freelance menu. It\u2019s the mode where you can really modify your experience all the way down to the pilot. Pilots determine the difficulty and reward multiplier that the operation will have which consists of multiple districts (maps). You can then choose your vehicle, primary weapon, secondary weapon, a special ability (smoke grenades, pulse wave, active camo, EMP), and the operation. It\u2019s generally a great time and maybe I\u2019ll be brave enough to use the smaller vehicles, but I\u2019ve been content with trying out the various heavy weapons in the Rat King which is the biggest mech I could find. The only limit in Freelance is your wallet which shouldn\u2019t be a problem. The maps aren\u2019t just recycled from the campaign, but you can run through the whole thing in one go if you buy the operation for it.\n\nThe game doesn\u2019t have a traditional narrative. Instead, each mission will have some text details when selecting one. The game\u2019s creator also states that the game itself focuses more on world building versus telling a story. Every single thing unlocked in the game through Acquisitions has a description which is how you find out more about the world of Brigador and its people. I especially liked the pilot stories and vehicle descriptions. Alternatively, if you dish out the extra money, then the audiobook can fill you in on the events prior and after the Great Leader\u2019s fall from a different perspective. The dozens upon dozens of unlocks should provide more than enough information by themselves though, so don\u2019t feel as if you\u2019re missing out. You\u2019re here to blow things up anyway.\n\nThe audiobook is there though so I\u2019ll talk a little about it. I\u2019m not used to critiquing books or audiobooks, but I have enjoyed what I listened to so far which was about seven chapters. I found the flowery language for warfare fairly pleasing. \u201cTortured metal\u201d \u201cglittering cloud of jagged shrapnel\u201d and \u201cburst bags of blood\u201d are some examples of the combat writing. What I liked most about the audiobook was how it fleshed out the world even more since it covers the events that happen right before the revolution and after. You also gain a much better understanding of the chaos that the Brigador contracts created since those lucrative contracts proved too alluring for even some of the Great Leader\u2019s army. The story mostly follows the carnage-filled tale of a patrol squad as they deal with the unexpected rebellion which takes place at the same time as the game\u2019s campaign. It\u2019s definitely a giant war story.\n\nBrigador is an excellent mech experience and one I plan to revisit every now and then when I have a craving, either for battle or synths. Players that have trouble with the default controls have other options available to them, so give those a go before requesting a refund. It\u2019s an extremely high quality game with an astonishingly low number of owners when I took a peek at SteamSpy numbers, so if you\u2019re interested in gritty vehicular warfare\u2026 Welcome, Brigador.", "timestamp_created": 1483007977, "timestamp_updated": 1497000317, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 34, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.736736", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28779877": {"recommendationid": "28779877", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013784400", "num_games_owned": 2585, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2466, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512704217}, "language": "english", "review": "God this game is good.

Yeah, these dudes rock.\n\nAnyways, I hope you'll give this game a chance.

And even better, a smorgasboard of lore.  The main campaign isn't much of a storyteller and you don't get that much of a conclusion, but even if that's a bit of a cheap move, it is thematic.  Most of the storytelling comes from buying intel from your contractors and they are damn well worth a read.  It's very flavorful, and I praise the devs for going out of their way to include at least a paragraph (usually more) of lore for basically every single unit in the game, every weapon, mech, pilot, etc.  It's awesome and hliarious to read.  \n\nI got this game as a gift from a friend while it was on sale for 10USD, but in my opinion this is well worth the original 20$.\n\nSome highlights;\n\nFirst off the game looks great.  I haven't played too many isometric games, but frankly, this one puts a lot of AAA titles to shame simply because of how impressed I was.  Harsh lighting, explosions, lasers, and some damn pretty mechs and ultratanks that are little more than minivans stacked on top of each other.  And the color and vibrancy in this game is absolutely top notch in some areas.  \n\nSecond, the game is exceedingly satisfying to play.  You have a vast array of weaponry at your disposal, a variety of mechs, all of which do a tremendous amount of damage.  The firing system takes a bit of time to get used to but once you do, it becomes second nature.  Don't try and actually line up a shot unless the enemy doesn't know you're there.  Follow an enemy and use your instincts and more times than not, you'll land a moving long distance shot against a speedy little bastard.  But, the game will get harder as you progress.  You have to think bolder and brazer to get where you need to go.  However, not once do you ever feel like the equipment you have gets arbitrarily weaker.  Your enemies get stronger but the destruction does not change.  You feel just as powerful as you did in the first few missions where you swamp right through most enemies even as they get insanely tough and numerous.  \n\nThird, the difficulty.  I was shocked to see metacritic (which is a pile of shit by the way) score at ~70.  Turns out, some people think this game is too difficult.  Sorry folks, take it like it is, but I'm not anywhere near to what most people would consider an exceptional gamer and I had very little difficulty plowing through most of the missions once I figured out what worked.  Most of the easy missions are just that; easy.  The harder missions are exactly that; hard, but also not arbitrarily so.\n\nFor one, the game doesn't make you do mental gymnastics to defeat an army of enemies.  You have to use your brain, but that doesn't mean you can't rush in like a bat out of hell, because the game does reward aggressive gameplay (shield recharge drops).  On the other hand, you can also sit back and snipe, but those shield drops might dissapate after around 15-25 seconds.  If you haven't killed everything in that area and are too far away, you might not have the shield boosting to tank a swarm of enemies to rush in and get it.  Then again, if you were too far away, you likely will have taken very little damage to warrant the need for a shield boost.  \n\nAll in all, combat is *organic* and it feels amazing.  I haven't said \"holy shit\" out loud in a game in a long time because the weapons you can get are sometimes insanely powerful; the devs weren't afraid of making everything powerful and viable at the same time.  If only games were both fun AND balanced these days.\n\n\nSome things I didn't like.\n\nIn every game that offers you a wide variety of equipment to use...why are the campaign levels solely constrained to a selection of units?  I hate that in games, and it's a serious pet peeve of mine.  I just want to ride in on a heavy mech and go to town.  Not be forced to play a different ship in a different playstyle.  To be fair, you get a decent variety of selections (4) for each campaign level so it is slightly alleviated in that way, but I still don't like it.  \nIT SHOULD BE STATED THERE IS A FREELANCE MODE where you can equip anything you want, any pilot, etc.  You just won't be riding through the campaign.  This alleviates the issues I have with limited equipment selection, but I liked playing the campaign missions more than freelance as they were more directed and unique than just \"murder targets of opportunity.\"\n\nA few of the weapons (that I've used in freelance) seem a little underpowered.  For example, there is the default machinegun on the Touro mech that has 600 rounds and fires rapidly.  On the same equipment slot, there is a slow firing cannon that has 60 rounds, and does...only a little more damage per shot, at like 1/7th the fire rate, and has 1/10th the ammunition.  It doesn't have a large AOE and only on occasion (40-60% of the time) one shot the lighter units in the game.  Meanwhile, it doesn't have nearly the suppressive power of the machine gun in use against large groups.  Each shot is far more punishing and therefore harder to hit.  \n\nMy only \"complaint\" is that I wish I could use more than two weapons at a time.  It's like every modern game has this \"balance\" of two weapons and I find it to be a very lackluster in the longevity of most games.  You can make a wide variety of any two weapons in this game...but most are going to be rather impractical.  I'm not saying the devs should spend the excessive amount of time coding/creating a system/assets where you can now mount THREE weapons on certain mechs, but it's something I want to bear in mind for maybe future endeavors.  Why can't I have TWO machine guns and my artilltery cannon?  \n\nBut really that's about it.  This game is damn near flawless.

It is probably the best, most accurate representation of one man versus an army and the best top-down isometric game I've ever played. TL;DR at bottom ->\n\n  While I loved the difficulty I can see how it could be off putting at first. You can choose your difficulty but not in the traditional way. Picking a pilot with a higher or lower max difficulty, choosing a stronger or weaker vehicle and then a longer or shorter operation (how manyand what levels you want to play) all make the game easier or harder and affect your payout. Even if you choose an easier pilot and powerful vehicle this game demands a LOT of situational awareness and a fair amount of thought before you act. Learning what vehicle and weapon set ups  complement each other is important. Part of it is also the controls. The default controls are relative to your vehicles hull and not to the screen as most top-down isometric games are but If you can get used to this movement I feel it adds to the games depth. If not there is a \"tank\" style control option.\n\n  The sheer number of vehicles and weapons means nearly anyone can find a combination that they will find fun, suits their play style, or fits the challenge they've set for themselves. The vehicles vary wildly from tiny tread bikes to fortress-like tanks. Hovering fighter planes to floating school buses with a battleship gun, and last but not least mechs from basicaly a suit of armor to four story tall doom machines. The guns are just as crazy, machine guns, tank caliber shotguns, and gas cannister launchers to name a few. At the time of this review there are 52 vehicles, 40 weapons and 4 specials and the devs have added more than a few of those after exiting early access including new pilots.\n\n  The style of everything and the music work so well together to set the tone of a retro, somewhat dystopian future and as an added bonus, despite a rather simple premise of \"pick killing machine, destroy all enemies\" there is an unusualy deep lore to Brigador. If you read the descriptions to the numerous pilots, vehicles, weapons and the info and lore available for purchase ingame the world really begins to come to life.\n\n-> It is very hard for me to find any faults with Brigador. The feel, the difficulty, and the variety of it all makes for a very satisfying game. The attention to every detail from difficulty to balance the atmoshphere and lore is amazing. The ONLY thing I feel is missing is multiplayer content or even just co-op but, honestly, it doesn't need it and that would just add a lot of unnecessary work. If you're thinking the price is too much for a simple 2d game, all I can say is its not as simple as it looks and the amount of work that went into and continues to go into this game makes it worth every penny of the $20 price tag. You wont be disappointed.\n\nP.S. This is the first review I've ever written. This game is THAT good.

You can't simply rush in like an idiot stomping and shooting everything. Past the very first babby missions, you must develop situational awareness, tread carefully (e.g., don't back into a gas station while aiming across the map), take facing into account (flanks and rear = more damage), take terrain and map layout into account (and use it against enemies where possible), manage sound because it attracts the attention of enemies (an exploding space cannon makes a great deal of noise; firing a quiet weapon, very little), prioritize targets, conserve your ammo, aim carefully, and use your special equipment wisely.\n\nThere's quite a learning curve at first. Learning to steer and aim simultaneously takes some getting used to, as does figuring out the flow of the game and what does what. One mistake can get you blown up or swarmed and botch an entire mission.\n\nThe maps and terrain are quite varied, from landscaped suburban housing enclaves to open fields to neon-bedecked cities to pipe- and factory-filled industrial zones. The faction and unit composition of the enemy force also differs and makes for markedly differently play, especially during the campaign.\n\nThere are currently 52 vehicles to choose from, more-or-less evenly split between mechs, tanks, and agravs (hover vehicles), and further split between three factions. Their attributes and handling vary widely, and many have special traits; even their profile can have an effect (needle-like vehicles are harder to hit head-on, for example). The smaller, frailer vehicles cost more to unlock and are harder to play but grant reward multipliers at mission end. There are 40 weapons split between five hardpoint categories and 4 pieces of special equipment (smokescreen, EMP grenade, optic camo, and demolition blast). These can be mixed and matched however you see fit, although the type of hardpoints (each vehicle has two) are fixed. These options allow for a great deal of flexibility and variety.\n\nMost of the unlocks after vehicles and equipment are for progressively longer and harder Freelance campaigns, and for pilots. Higher-level pilots increase mission difficulty and payout, and cost progressively more to unlock. There are also a bunch of Intel/Lore items to unlock that offer a lot of backstory for the game.\n\nThe game's almost purely skill-based. Taking a frail vehicle piloted by a high-difficulty pilot through a long, high-difficulty Freelance campaign is possible, but requires a great deal of practice and familiarity with the game.\n\nA mech simulator it ain't, but it is a beautiful, detailed, well-made game that requires a lot more than mindless button-mashing and features hard (potentially EXTREMELY hard), but fair, difficulty.", "timestamp_created": 1481288437, "timestamp_updated": 1481288562, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.569301", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28232739": {"recommendationid": "28232739", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009341087", "num_games_owned": 309, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 1483, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496620894}, "language": "english", "review": "Great little game very reminiscent of that old Battletech game on the Sega Genesis. Just add in beatifully complex and expansive enviornments (which are totally and gleefully destroyable), an awesome soundtrack, tons vehicles to use, and a bunch of fairly unique weapons to play with. Everything from railguns that punch through entire city blocks, autocannons, howitzers, chemical weapons, lasers of all shapes and sizes, and plenty of other stuff that screams \"warcrime.\" In Freelance mode (aka best mode), you're able to pick a vehicle and slap on whatever it's hardpoints can handle. Tons of fun. Ontop of that, the game has a surprising amount of lore to dig into if you so desire (it's totally optional). Many of the weapons have a fair bit of reality behind them. Lorentz force weapons, caseless ammunition, superposed load weapons, all kinds of goodies. There are lore entries on the vehicles and how they fit into the world. It's surprisingly well fleshed out.\n\nA WORD OF WARNING: the controls will likely take you some time to get comfortable with. I've died multiple times to accidentally running into fuel refineries or other \"energetic\" terrain early on. And believe me when I say it's frustrating. It's like an insta-kill landmine for many vehicles. The crux of the problem is basically... pushing up will not make you go up. W is accelerate and S is reverse. A and D turn you. Tank controls, basically. The mechs handle the same way. A-gravs are witchcraft and I cannot pilot them. A-gravs float and will always point to the cursor, with W and S moving towards and away from the cursor respectively. A and D strafe relative to the cursor. So if the cursor is below your agrav, the controls are basically reversed. D would move you left on the screen. It makes my brain hemorrage and my a-grav crash into gas stations. As far as I know there isn't a way to alter this stuff either. So if tank controls aren't your thing, you might wanna reconsider. 'Cause you're gonna have to get pretty good with them. ie: reversing your tank backwards through the wavy maze you carved out of the inner city while you kite some lumbering death machine. Your vehicle's armor is strongest in front, so you'll be doing quite a bit of fancy reverse work.\n\ntl;dr - if you can handle the controls and the initial difficulty, the game is a smorgasbord of tactical mayhem and destruction with a mountain of variety to play with in Freelance mode.

Now that it had been released for a while, I rediscovered it and bought the game +OST and audiobook during a sale... Yeah, shame on me (I only buy games during sales these days).\n\nAt the time of writing this, I have played Brigador for over 26 hours; this should, in my opinion, be enough to give a good estimate of its qualities.\n\nBrigador is, without doubt, a gem. And I'm not talking diamond-in-the-rough here, but a real, polished gem.\n\nThe lore, while not the main selling point, is fantastic. Through well-written pilot and equipment descriptions as well as dedicated lore and intel entries you get a glimpse into a fleshed-out universe that has obviously been crafted with love and care. Add to that the fantastic 80's-synth-inspired soundtrack and beautiful, cyberpunk-esque graphical presentation and you've already got a winner. But the real star here is the gameplay; Brigador is not just an isometric mech shooter, but a surprisingly deep and engaging experience.\n\n\n[u][b]Finally an honest game description[/b][/u]\n\nThe game's description in the store is surprisingly accurate. Here's what it says:\n\n[i]Choose your vehicle, weapons, pilot, and defense.\nAssault the districts of Solo Nobre, then escape or die trying.\nYour choice.[/i]\n\nThis describes the Freelance mode, which is the core of the game, pretty well.\n\nFirst you choose from a wide selection of pilots, most of which you have to unlock with hard-earned in-game currency. These pilots, however, do not differ in skills or stats, but in terms of difficulty. Each pilot has a minimum and maximum difficulty level, a set increase in difficulty per finished district, a mission complete bonus and a minimum and maximum payout multiplier.\n\nThis can mean, for example, that some pilots are better for short missions (i.e. finished only three districts), as they have a fixed difficulty and payout multiplier. Other pilots are better at longer runs, with difficulty and payout multiplier increasing with each finished district.\n\nOnce you have decided on a pilot, you need to select a vehicle, and there are a lot to choose from (with additional vehicles possibly being added with future patches).\nVehicles come in three flavors: Mechs, tanks and so-called agravs (think hovertanks). Each of these classes handles very differently, and they are further divided by weight class and faction.\n\nGenerally speaking, the more powerful, heavier vehicles are cheap to unlock but offer little or no additional payout multiplier, whereas the lighter, often less-heavily armed vehicles are more expensive to unlock (and often harder to play) but offer a higher payout multiplier (usually between 1.5 and 3.0, with one 10.0 vehicle being the exception).\n\nEach vehicle has two weapon hardpoints, which can fall into these categories: Main, heavy, auxiliary, small and turret. Every category has 8 unique and powerful weapons to choose from, a whopping 40 weapons all in all.\n\nAdditionally, you can equip your vehicle with one of four different special weapons, that can have either defensive or offensive purposes - or a mix of both.\n\nFinally you choose a mission - which is a sort of mini-campaign consisting of several maps or 'districts' - and that's it. In order to finish and leave a district you need to complete at least one of these goals:\n1. Destroy all four planetary defense cannons\n2. Eliminate all enemy captains (usually between 4 and 6)\n3. Destroy at least 75% of your opposition\n\nThere are also optional goals which you can (and should) complete for a better payout.\n\n\n[u][b]Make no mistake... or it'll be your last.[/b][/u]\n\nOnce the mission begins, you start at one of several possible entry locations for each map; which one you spawn in is random.\n\nYour goal is to fulfill your mission and, most importantly, stay alive and finally extract via spaceport. If you fail, there is no continue, and around 99% of your accumulated points - your payout - will be withheld in order to cover your 'funeral expenses'. Basically, the game just says \"screw you!\" and gives you the finger when you die. And there are many, many ways to die; most of which start with the player doing something stupid.\n\nIf you don't pay attention to your surroundings and blow up something explosive while standing right next to it, you will die. (Sounds like a noob mistake, but believe me, it happens more often than you think.)\n\nIf you get cocky and rush into a large group of enemies, or trigger an alarm to have basically a whole districts worth of enemies converging on your last known location, you will die (at least if you don't GTFO immediately).\n\nIf you select a combination of vehicle and weaponry you are not (yet) comfortable with and decide to do a high-difficulty run, you will absolutely, positively die in the most horrific way possible.\n\nThis game can be hard, and sometimes unforgiving, but [i]how[/i] hard (or easy) is actually up to you, the player.\n\nIf you like to take it easy or simply get acquainted with the game and its controls, choose a powerful vehicle/weapon combo, an 'easy' pilot and whatever length of mission you feel like doing. As long as you finish it and get paid in the end, you're a winner.\n\nOr, if you want to feel miserable, ride a tuk-tuk equipped with shrapnel-blasting cannons into the depths of hell (which seems to be anything higher than difficulty level ~7).\n\nSpeaking of difficulty, there are levels ranging from 1 to 13 (there's even a certain pilot with a difficulty of 0, actually), and the first few of these are rather mild. Personally speaking I've been able to beat up to level 7 reliably with a reasonably powerful vehicle and weapons, but anything above is pure madness (to me, at least).\n\n\n[u][b]We need guns. Lots of guns.[/b][/u]\n\nOne of the great things about Brigador is its large variety of vehicles and weapons. Pretty much every playstyle is possible.\n\nIf you want to blast your enemies to smithereens from afar with naval cannons mounted to an ultra heavy tank, you can do just that.\n\nIf you love to zoom around in a tiny agrav and murder your enemies in the face with shrapnel cannons that's totally possible.\n\nAnd if you like a heavy mech that stomps things that get too close and shoots lasers and gatling guns at everyone else - be my guest.\n\nThat being said, none of the above works without some sort of tactical modus operandi; simply rushing in, guns blazing will quickly get you killed on anything but the lowest difficulties.\n\nFinding out what works for you (and what doesn't) is important (and fun).\n\n\n[u][b]But wait! There's more.[/b][/u]\n\nThis review focuses mostly on the freelance mode, which is the bread and butter of Brigador. However, there is also a campaign mode that should at least be played for the tutorials as well as the first few levels in order to learn the ropes of the game.\n\nAfter that, it quickly becomes tough as nails (and very, very frustrating, IMHO).\n\n(Not saying that it's bad - I just suck at it.)\n\n\n[u][b]Summary[/b][/u]\n\nSo, is Brigador good? Without a doubt. In fact, it's great. The controls are precise (though learning to aim some weapons correctly takes practice), the overall presentation leaves an impression of a game crafted with love and care, and the gameplay is surprisingly deep - much more than you would expect judging solely from screenshots or videos of this game.\n\nThe soundtrack is fantastic as well and definitely worth getting, IMHO. (I have only started the 7-and-a-half hour long audiobook, but it's good!)\n\nStill wondering if you'll enjoy this game?\nIf you like mechs, lasers, fully destructible environments, and all things sci-fi, shooting things from an isometric perspective, enjoy tight, challenging gameplay and a game that can be tailored to your needs and tastes to some degree, Brigador may just be the thing to cure your itch.", "timestamp_created": 1480420511, "timestamp_updated": 1480422582, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 30, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.706666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28029378": {"recommendationid": "28029378", "author": {"steamid": "76561197964483877", "num_games_owned": 414, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 1465, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 7, "last_played": 1513563639}, "language": "english", "review": "This game came screaming out of the 90s wearing a thick coat of 80s aesthetic.

I was blowing stuff up, and I was dying a lot from getting stuck on things.\n\nNormally I would probably have moved on, but I stuck with it, because the whole game had a strange vibe that had me coming back. The lack of any voices, the menus, the faces, the soundtrack, the unique visuals. And I knew there was a lot I would like already, with its' mostly pragmatic approach to mech and tank designs.\n\n\nAbout 6 hours in, when I discovered the freelance mode, it started to click. Cash was earned from completing contracts, then spent on pilots that act as difficulty modifiers, and vehicles/gear, for you to take your own combination on a contract. As I unlocked them, I started reading the descriptions. It soon became clear this was the type of game I would consider a classic.\n They've nerded out on the lore. Every weird vehicle design is explained, and their history told from the perspective of the crewmen. There's mechs hated by their mechanics for wearing parts out quickly. Weapons feared for their cruelness rather than destructive potential.\nI started using my cash to unlock stuff in the pure lore section of the menus. The world they've built started to come together. Everything made sense, the gameplay, the reason why all the pilots go on destructive rampages before flying off planet.\nThis spices the experience. There was hints of tactics to employ with the different weapons.

They're 100% functional and I've had no issues at all since I figured out all the little quirks. Graphics are good, combat is satisfying, vehicle and weapon diversity is great, and the tone and atmosphere are very well realized. It's by far one of the most well thought through indie games I've ever played. A relativly simple core gameplay system is surrounded by very well realized framework. the maps are richly detailed, featuring farms, monorail systems, neon-lit entertainment districts, train yards, highways choked with abandoned cars, and more. Every vehicle, weapon, and pilot comes with it's own little lore entry, and the nature of the setting gets more and more clear the further you progress through the game. Even if you're not much one for lore, the thought they put into the setting still fills out the gameplay like mortar around bricks, and it all comes together in a simple (but not as simple as it looks) but engaging and well crafted mech shooter.\n\nIn short, I can't recomend it highly enough.

Don't expect otherwise.\n\nOverall: Haven't been this excited about a 'mech game since I was a kid playing MechWarrior 3. Not worth the $20(in my opinion), but definetly go for it if it's on sale.\nRating: 8.75/10\n\nThe game is a pixel 'mech/tank/hovercraft shooter where you can play a 'story' mode or a replayable mission mode where you can make money to acquire new stuff(lore, enemy briefings, vehicles, weapons). The thought put into this game is impressive, the pixel graphics are very well-done, and are easily one of this games many strong points.\n\nThis game's difficulty, at least, in the non-mission mode, scales based on the pilot the player chooses and vehicle they drive. Lighter, less offensively-geared vehicles means more cash, and higher level pilots means more cash, more enemies, and higher quality enemies. Difficulty in mission mode seems to be that smaller vehicles are harder, but that's somewhat a personal preference issue.\n\nLoadouts in this game cannot be customized as highly as MechWarrior. There are two weapon slots per vehicle, and four(I believe) weapon categories. Weapons are furher divided into ballistic, energy, repeating, and something else which is purple(don't know what those are, explosive?). Weapons deal different damage levels to different targets(shields, health, structures). Energy weapons have low penetration(railguns are considered energy weapons in this game, but, realisticially, they're ballistic). Ballistics have high(er) penetration. Machine guns and explosives tend to simply damage cover(though explosives are much more effective).\n\nYou can also affix a special to your vehicle. The options available are EMP, smoke grenades, active camoflage, and Audio-Kinetic pulse(directional sonic death-cone).\n\nThis game is one of the four best purchases I've made on Steam.\n(The others being Stardew Vallley, Cryptark, and Divinity: Dragon Commander)", "timestamp_created": 1477714519, "timestamp_updated": 1502001000, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26280104": {"recommendationid": "26280104", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044725801", "num_games_owned": 540, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 762, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481507111}, "language": "english", "review": "I like the part when you blow stuff up.\nCan be a little tricky to get used to the controls, but once you get into the swing of things it's a super satisfying game to pilot.

Since my purchase, Brigador remains a very enjoyable and cathartic game.  The graphics are very detailed, with entrancing lighting effects, satisfying destructability and complex, but rewarding vehicles with which to to wreak havoc.   The ones I have encountered thus far include tanks, various sized mechs and hover vehicles, with each class having unique movement, stats, weapons, etc.  Admittedly, it takes a while to acquaint yourself with the controls, as most vehicles have separate movement and turret controls, which can be slightly disorienting at first, but these are quickly learned through addictive gameplay that doesn't punish failure.  If you die, just start the level again, maybe with one of the different vehicles permitted for the mission and try a different approach (smoke to hide your movement, or camo to sneak into position).  \n\nAnother point of potential contention is that the game doesn't feature savegames.  The missions aren't typically that long, but are sometimes difficult and losing progress right near the end can be a little frustrating.  This frustration has not stopped me from diving right back in however, and there is a clear sense of satisfaction when completing the level, despite having died multiple times in the session.\n\nI must make specific mention of the excellent soundtrack done by Makeup and Vanity Set.  It gives the action a great feel and I find myself nodding along, as I stomp, crush and smash my way through the levels.  I have since bought the soundtrack, as well as two other albums by MAVS and it is definitely worthwhile checking out.\n\nFor what it's worth, I highly recommend Brigador.", "timestamp_created": 1476822496, "timestamp_updated": 1476822496, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500689", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26008391": {"recommendationid": "26008391", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027472432", "num_games_owned": 247, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 4445, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512971441}, "language": "english", "review": "Brigador is without a doubt one of the best isometric shooters out there, it is a solid start for those who feel curious about the kind of gameplay and an absolute must for dedicated fans of the genre.\n\nDon't get fooled by the deceptively simple gameplay, which is about shooting things, because behind the layer of simplicity lies a set of layers that adds to the complexity of the battle system: damage type, weapon type, vehicle type, noise generated, terrain, positioning, even the factions you're up against only serve to create a cohesive, intuitive and intelligent battle design, so you'll find yourself dying constantly if you think it's about just going turret mode and shooting whatever comes across your weaponry.\n\nThe art style is absolutely gorgeous to look at, nailing that 80s cyberpunk look with a spritework that is just downright beautiful. The levels arent just some mindless details thrown into a box, many sprites dedicated to the different environments serve the purpose of giving life to the setting, and the effort is such that there's even sprites for small road traffic barriers and street lamps. The buildings, the debris, the vehicle models, the farms/countryside, even the small pedestrians running around, everything looks so good, it almost feels like watching a tabletop of very high quality models, and I'm particularly fond of spritework, especially the ones with this level of quality.\n\nThe soundtrack only compounds that 80s feeling with the neo 80s style it has, it's really cool and provides much of the feeling of being a kickass inside a vehicle blowing stuff up with the tension of being swarmed by enemy units and pulling off maneuvers to keep yourself alive and kicking. The main theme that plays when you boot up the game is only the tip of the iceberg regarding the quality of the music here.\n\nNot only do the devs put in the effort of an excelent, buttery smooth gameplay and great audiovisual design, there's also a universe built around the game, a huge amount of lore and story details is put on Solo Nobre, it's factions, the pilots, even the weapons and vehicles are described in terms of the game's fiction, giving even more life to the setting. You can even read the contract's terms that the brigadors sign!\n\nThe game features a campaign (a series of missions played using specific vehicle builds) and freelance mode (missions set in districts in which you can use a vehicle build of your choosing), and while the gameplay is rock solid and responsive that definitely help freelance mode, the campaign is more of a challenge mode rather than a story since there are only small explanations an nothing more aside from the intro given at the end of the first story mission. It's not a bad thing per se, but there is just so much lore giving life to the setting that the lack of a proper story detailing the fall of Solo Nobre doesn't do justice to the existing potential. On the gameplay side, a little balancing could help the utility of the defensive abilities, as the active camo is way above the usefulness of the AK pulse and the EMP grenade.\n\nHowever, those are small concerns I have that don't really detract from the excellent quality at display here, and with the devs showing even further support with the recent inclusion of different control schemes and a level editor down the line, only good things appear to be certain for the future of this game, which is a shame since this game deserves way more love considering the level of effort and execution.\n\nTL;DR - It's a great game that deserves a lot of love, and I thoroughly recommend it to anyone. Well, at least if you're into isometric shooters anyway.

It's the top-down tactical explosion bonanza you've been waiting for!\n\nIn Bridgador, you take command of one of several mercenaries of questionable mental health, tasked with what is essentially the terrorising of the planet Solo Nobre for monetary and political gain. The objectives don't change too much from level to level, and essentially boil down to destory everything while avoiding being destroyed - which can be a rather difficult task depending on the vehicle, loadout and tactics you choose to emply.\n\nThere are two modes of play, a campaign and 'freelance' mode. The campaign is more story heavy, as you might expect (although it's not obnoxiously in-your-face either), but my favourite mode is Freelance, where completing missions provides funds to buy new vehicles, pilots, weapons etc. Bonus money is awarded for taking weaker mechs (or more unstable pilots!). Experimenting with the weapons is a joy. A lot of it is imbalanced in a beautiful way - some weapons are terrible, some punch above their weight class, and it rewards experimentation.\n\nThe gameplay its-self is from an isometric perspective (reminiscent of Mechwarrior 3050 on the SNES for me), and the default controls are like that of a tank (AWSD to rotate and stomp forwards/backwards, mouse to aim). The aiming in particular is quite nuanced, as the mechs are often taller than the things they're shooting at, so you need to aim where you intend the projectile to hit, rather than in the general direction of the enemy. There are many interesting touches and lots of attention to detail.\n\nAll in all, the worst aspect of Brigador is that the missions tend to be a tad samey (especially in Freelance mode, the objectives are the same each time), but the terrain you stomp though and specifics of the fights you'll have to take keep things interesting. It's by no means a perfect game, but if you enjoy mech or future war themes, explosions or tactical shooty gameplay, definitely check out...

I'm sure there are plenty of reviews already that explain the ins and outs of the game, so I'll just list what I like.\n\nBrigador has very good art. You can see the care that went into every single sprite. The thought put into the engineering of these vehicles. There are three different factions in the game, each with their own sort of theme. The Loyalists are pretty standard Battletech/Starcraft Terran style that you'd expect from a game like this, with some creative twists. The Spacers have vehicles that look very high-tech and elegant, but still believable in design. Orange checkerboard patterns, thin lightweight legs, spherical wheels instead of tank treads, lots of moving parts. The Corvids (my favorite) have vehicles that are cobbled together from old truck frames, salvaged legs, and the occasional stripped out muscle car. Each vehicle has character and creativity in its design.\n\nBrigador has a lot of variety. You choose a vehicle, bolt your choice of two weapons onto it, and roll out. There are many different vehicles in the game, each with its own list of statistics such as hull strength, turn speed, forward movement speed, chassis turn speed, etc. Each weapon does something different. The Abbot is a giant cannon that punches through armor through sheer concussive force. The Otomo is a giant, short-ranged sustained laser that can melt through metal like marshmallows over a fire, but takes a few seconds to focus in. The Gutterball is a giant ball of heavy metal launched like a catapult that arcs over obstacles and crashes through buildings like they're made of paper. The Harvester is a massive artillery strike that flies high into the air before splitting into a cluster of explosives and then destroying a city block as it lands. These guns are all unique and satisfying to use.\n\nBrigador has unique and interesting lore.  It's mostly presented through vehicle descriptions and the backstory of the selectable pilot characters. It all paints a bleak picture of an interesting and cohesive world. Also, the developers have approached a professional author to write a book set in the game's universe. It's definitely worth a read.

Between the soundtrack, the tactical gameplay, and the overall feel of the controls, there is a lot to love. However the game also suffers from certain issues that may disuade people.\nPros: \nMusic:Great soundtrack from Makeup and Vanity set that has been added to through recent updates.\n\nDifficulty: The difficulty of the game can fluctuate wildly, although most of the time it feels like smart play and knowing the strengths of your loadout will help you prevail. Overall the best way to improve is through practice, you can't just jump in and expect to win missions or contracts on your first try.\n\nStory: The lore has been expanded upon and is interesting to read, however I feel like locking it behind a credit wall was a bit unnessary, as it would be better served to unlock it by defeating enemies or by completing a certain number of missions in an area. \n\nCons: \nLoadouts: While mentioned as a pro, certain campaign missions feature loadouts that are near impossible to use (at least for me), and as a result it can be very difficult to complete missions.\n\nVisuals: While the visuals give you a great feeling of destruction and power in a mech, it can be difficult at times to find smaller enemies who have the ability to detonate and remove a huge chunk of your shield in all the chaos. This can be especially frustrating when you already have low health and you die from it. \n\nLore acquisition: To give yourself a better understanding of enemies and what you'll be facing, you need to purchase lore with credits. These aren't necessarily expensive, but they can add up quickly for what is essentially flavor text and minor tips. Really this should be changed based on encounters or enemies defeated.\n\nOverall: It's a great game that invokes the feeling of Hotline Miami and similar games at times, although this has to be taken with a grain of salt, as missions are longer than Hotline Miami, and the game is much more punishing for death. Smart play and tactics are necessary to succeed, and the controls do take some getting used to.

Using your weapons platform, which may fly, crawl, or walk, you must defeat your unreasonable opposition by taking advantage of your superior knowledge of the battlefield and reshaping that battlefield through strategic demolition of cover. This is a game of rocket tag - concentrated weapons fire can eradicate all but the sturdiest of vehicles in a handful of seconds, so you must ensure you get the first and last shot by attacking from surprise. It does this excellently.\n\nThe game is not flawless - the control scheme is not intuitive. It is not particularly difficult, but it takes getting used to. Your viewpoint is isometric, but your vehicle is facing in a specific direction and it's up to you to ensure it's pointing the right direction. The game will require you to split your attention between where you're aiming, and where you are, often while both of those are changing very rapidly. If you can master multitasking between your own movement and your own aiming, you'll be a much stronger player.\n\nEdit: Since this review was first published, an additional difficulty customization was added. The speed of time in the game can be slowed as low as 50% of normal speed. This allows you to develop a sense of the game at a more managable pace. It can be adjusted up and down in-mission in the menu.\n\nThe game's writing is excellent. The story of Solo Nobre is communicated through mission briefings, and through optional lore you can purchase from the in-game store you use to buy new pilots, vehicles, and weapons. This lore includes the contract that your Brigador signs with the Solo Nobre Concern which employs you, information on the culture of Solo Nobre, and briefings on the technology of the setting written by other characters who appear in the narrative. It's a small slice of the setting, not an expansive narrative, but it's presented potently.\n\nEdit: Since this review was first published, some additional material was added to the game. Some of it is satirical or jokey, and does not fit with the rest of the narrative, but this material is not subtle about it and it's clear that it's a joke, so it doesn't really undermine the setting so much as sit next to it wearing a funny hat.\n\nSolo Nobre must fall, Brigador.", "timestamp_created": 1474760465, "timestamp_updated": 1482980306, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500105", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25674065": {"recommendationid": "25674065", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970324415", "num_games_owned": 241, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 889, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503247126}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game, fun gameplay, the mechs and environments are really well detailed (and fully destructible) and the soundtrack is amazing!\n\nI'm about 3/4 through the campaign and on that alone I recommend this game, have not even tried the freelance mode.\n\nEach level of the campaign can be played with 4 different mechs, which I guess is like difficulty levels as some mechs are less suited to certain encounters but this is where you need to play to the absolute extent of your mech's strengths.\n\nBought a copy for my brother as this is really an underappreciated gem going by the review count... if you like what you see in the trailers go for it you won't be disappointed!", "timestamp_created": 1474735542, "timestamp_updated": 1474735542, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500105", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25627652": {"recommendationid": "25627652", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990807775", "num_games_owned": 176, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 853, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496560713}, "language": "english", "review": "This was a great game with an awesome soundtrack really I cannot get enough of that awesome music!", "timestamp_created": 1474502172, "timestamp_updated": 1474502172, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500105", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25596799": {"recommendationid": "25596799", "author": {"steamid": "76561197982708568", "num_games_owned": 178, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 736, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506282007}, "language": "english", "review": "You get to play as a merciless gun-for-hire wreaking havoc during a political crisis on Solo Nobre. \n\nCollateral damage?

The control system allows (and requires) a lot more precision than an arcade-style shooter, both in movement and firing - the more you play, the more you appreciate why this is a good thing. The game is also brutally unforgiving for anyone taking a gung-ho approach (unless you know what you're doing) - there is no repair during missions and even the heaviest vehicles can be swiftly wrecked if surrounded in the open - also triggering an alert can make things significantly harder. This can be frustrating to begin with, but is very rewarding once you get a feel for the controls and the tactical aspects of the gameplay.\n\nThough there is a campaign of 20 or so missions, the real attraction and longevity of the game lies in freelance mode, where you can choose your vehicle, weapon loadout and mission locations. You can unlock these assets from a large list using money earned from completing missions. It's a good idea to do the first few campaign missions before embarking on freelance mode, as these serve both as a tutorial and a also a quick way to get a decent cash balance to start unlocking assets for freelance mode (though the starting vehicles and weapons are pretty good, they may not suit your playstyle - personally I unlocked active camo as soon as I could).\n\nThe range of vehicles and weapons available offers a huge variety to suit different playstyles; it's like having a large toybox of futuristic fighting vehicles and weapons. For vehicles you have a variety of mechs, tanks and anti-grav vehicles all with different handling, armour and loadout options. For weapons you have a variety of cannons, mortars, rocket launchers, chain guns and lasers. You can even unlock different pilots who effectively raise the difficulty (and reward) level of missions.\n\nDespite the lo-fi graphics, the game is nicely atmospheric with its neon nightscapes and synth music that evokes 80s sci fi films such as Escape from New York. This has a very similar look and atmosphere to Neon Chrome.\n\nThis game won't be for everyone, but if you can get past the learning curve and appreciate its strengths, then you'll find this offers much more gameplay than a lot of full price games. It's a shame that original gems like this get overlooked in favour of flashier, larger-budget games with less gameplay.\n\nDefinitely worth the asking price for the gameplay it offers.

They are forced into difficult situations, burdened on one hand with Labors unable to find sufficient cover, and on the other hand humans unable to take on the drones on their own. Tactics change as the battle progresses, contingent not only on the abilities of the participants themselves, but their surroundings and positioning. Piloting a large craft becomes both a blessing and a curse in tight quarters.\n\nI'm not much of a strategy or tactics gamer, but Brigador offers a keen reproduction of this sensation in a way that I have not felt in other games. A tank with the power to decimate my armor is stalking a city district block by block on the lookout for my mech. I switch on my cloaking device and sneak past an advancing column of small infantry units, careful not to cause any destruction on my way. As my cloak dissipates, I dodge into an alleyway and let the tank have it from behind with both barrels; it explodes before it can even swivel around and set me in its crosshairs. I stomp its remains out of my way and veer around another corner to put some distance between the now-alerted infantry and me. I gauge my situation and decide I have more than enough ammo: I hunker down, swivel towards the advancing units and aim my fire at the tower block between me and them. As my cannon brings the building down I use my secondary mount to vaporize my targets through the newly-created hole in the scenery.\n\nThe difficult, player-relative controls are a successful part of what makes this game's atmosphere both tense and deliberate; I'm piloting a [i]mobile weapons platform[/i], not playing a game of robotron. Being able to deftly turn a corner is a valuable skill that comes with practice, like lobbing artillery or targeting flying units. That said, the controls are still difficult for me; if I let go of Brigador in the near future it will probably be due to this fact combined with the overall difficulty of mid- and late-game missions, since I certainly didn't breeze through the first few. I know I won't ever unlock everything.\n\nI hope to spend a lot more time with this game in the future.

At the end of a mission you're given money based on the objectives achieved, collateral damage inflicted, and then multiplied based on the vehicle (worse vehicle = higher multiplier) and the pilot (higher level pilot = harder difficulty = higher multiplier) \nHow this plays out is that the level 0 starting pilot plus a badass Mech or Heavy tank will let you just wade in and destroy everything without concern in most cases, especially in the early levels, while using a high level pilot (especially level 6 or more) and a weaker vehicle (like the Party Van) will require very well-executed stick-and-move tactics that focus on attracting just a few enemies at a time and ambushing them around a corner while leaving you a clear escape route. \n\nI've found the best strategy is to bait in just a few at a time in such a corner, and as you destroy them, haul ass to that corner to collect ammo and shield energy as you need it. Especially in later levels it's unlikely that you'll have killed them all when you need more ammo or shield energy, so you have to get good at running right up to them and getting the shield energy and ammo you need while still effectively fighting and not exposing your much more vulnerable rear to a powerful enemy unit. \nDon't be greedy about this, and try to have a second fallback position cleared out so you can lure them back around a second corner instead of charging in if need be. \nUltimately this strategy can get you through most of the game but the crux of it gets down to very accurate fire and learning how to switch from one target to another very quickly. \n\n\nOverall tl;dr style:\nPros\n-Flexible styles of play based on vehicles and weapons loadout\n-Lots of destroyable envirionment, and stuff that explodes\n-Super 1980's technophile steampunky feel both with art and music\n-Very NES levels of simplistic AI and en masse attacks if you get too aggressive. \n-Very challenging at higher levels, very NES-style levels of victory feel when finally beating a tough mission with a tough combination. \n\nCons\n-Very, very easy to die. \n-NES levels of frustration and urge to yell and curse when you do. \n-Envirionments are pretty consistent and similar, but given that it's an isometric game that means that all of those elements need to be made one at a time, so I'd rather have the nicely detailed urban and grassland options vs a half ass version of those and snowy areas, moonscape, etc. The story takes place on one planet so there's that going for consistency as well. \n\n-No way to save your progress on longer freelance campaigns. \nLater Freelance missions will have you taking on 39 different map areas in a row without the ability to skip a map or save your progress in between them. This means if you're going to seriously attempt one of these longer campaigns you better be ready to quit and forfeit all of your progress, or buckle up for hours and hours of play. When using the ambush strategies I described above, and taking it slow to try to bait in just a few enemies at a time, this can take a LONG time. \n\n-If you're in a level too long, the music gets through the track and quits playing. This is lonely and sad when I'm taking my sweet ass time trying to ambush big enemies in a Party Van. \n\n-Loadout customization is very over-simplified, but still vague. Different weapons are given nicknames and come in four basic types (cannon, machine guns, mortars, and lasers) and five different size classes (heavy, main, turret, auxillary, and small) but I end up remembering which weapons do what based on nothing more than their ammo capacity and nothing else. Give me designations, or at least display the actual weapon name in the HUD, please! In a perfect world, having an animation displaying the weapon firing in the weapon description would be really nice. \n\n-Everything you buy (weapons, vehicles, pilots) just has 'redacted' in its description before you buy it. Meaning you have absolutely no idea if the weapon that some enemy just used to mess you up is actually the one you're buying. Nor do you really know anything about it beyond the weapon type. This is frustrating and I ended up just getting a decent combo together with an OK pilot/vehicle multiplier total and grinded an easier freelance mission over and over again until I could buy all the weapons to get it over with. Vehicles are similarly frustrating but you're not QUITE as blind in picking those.\n\n-The main Campaign and the Freelance work always has a mix of who you're fighting and who you're fighting for, but the descriptions of all the equipment and pilots etc are all written from the perspective of one dude in one faction (who you can buy as a pilot) \nIt would be nice if there were a Spacer campaign, a Loyalist campaign, and a Corvid campaign for a nice storyline. \n\n\nOverall I think it's a very fun, challenging isometric shooter that requires forethought and strategy to get through it, and it has a lot of very oldschool steampunk bladerunner-esque feeling world elements as well. Be prepared for a challenge in later levels. \nI really hope they develop more missions and an expanded storyline in the future, and perhaps open up more vehicles to use!

At that time, just for the sake of nostalgia I knew I was going to play Brigador eventually, that time finally arrived.\n\n[b][u]Story:[/u][/b]\n\nBrigador takes place in Solo Nobre, one of the several colonies in the Outer Colonies region. The Great Leader of Solo Nobre had implemented a totalitarian regime and adopted an isolationist stance by building orbital guns that would shoot down any spacecraft that would approach Solo Nobre atmosphere, thus preventing supplies and help from Earth and other colonies to arrive in the planet surface. Now, the Great Leader has been killed and it\u2019s up to the Solo Nobre Concern (SNC) and its hired Brigadors to liberate Solo Nobre from tyranny and its 3 major factions who\u2019re trying to seize control, the loyalists, the corvids and the spacers.\n\nOne thing I really like about Brigador, which I feel like some people won\u2019t, is the fact that all of its lore is delivered via text and most of it you have to purchase with credits that you get by completing contracts. These pieces of intel can be about the design process of certain mechs, locations which you\u2019ll visit, factions, the background of the Solo Nobre colony, among others. These are really engaging and I\u2019ve spent a fair amount of time reading through several entries, I just wish there were more of them. That said, I would\u2019ve liked to have seen a more streamlined campaign mode, perhaps even with dialogue and voice acting.\n\n[b][u]Game Modes:[/u][/b]\n\nThere are 2 different modes in the game, Campaign and Freelance. The Campaign mode isn\u2019t really you standard \u201ccampaign mode\u201d, it\u2019s more a series of challenges that let you get your hands on various types of weaponry and units. There are a total of 21 levels in the campaign and these can take between 5 to 15 minutes to complete depending on how you play and if you want to go after secondary targets. You can play each campaign level with 1 of 4 brigadors, some more easy to play with than the others. Besides that, every single level also has some sort of briefing that tells you what you\u2019re going to do on that mission, what you should expect and why you\u2019re doing it.\n\nOn the other hand ,the Freelance mode is where the real meat of the game is at. You can use your credits, either from the Campaign or this mode, to unlock pilots with different stats, vehicles, primary and secondary weapons as well as different special abilities. After that, you\u2019re able to pick one of several operations. Each operation has various districts you can go through and some allow you to leave the operation earlier in order to save the credits you\u2019ve earned that far, because if you die once you won\u2019t receive any credits.\n\n[b][u]Gameplay:[/u][/b]\n\nIf you boil down Brigador to its bare core what you\u2019ll find is something rather simple, select your Brigador, your pilot, your weapons, go into a specific zone, kill/destroy a certain target and extract. Simple. This is where Brigador excels, it takes a very simple concept and makes it extremely varied and challenging. Weapons range from railguns to cannons, lasers to machine guns, each with their own unique weight and feel that depending on your vehicle size and weight can make it so that it recoils back when firing. The variety of vehicles is what really amazes me, 45 different vehicles each with their own design and little description on how they were created and feeling that probably isn\u2019t similar to any other.\n\nThere is a rather noticeable difficulty curve that might drive some people off but the devs seem to be working on making different control schemes available to players. Learning how to control and get a proper feel of different vehicles takes its time and is part of the experience. Don\u2019t expect to master playing as a Mech and then switch to a agrav (anti-gravity) tank and still retain the same amount of precision and control that you had with the previous type of unit. Learning the controls and how/how long each Brigador takes to respond to your inputs is vital in order to succeed in the completion of your contract. \n\nThe game doesn\u2019t impose any sorts of rules for how you should approach your objective, be it eliminate an enemy unit or destroy a series of buildings. You chose the way you want to play. Follow the roads and sneak around or open a path across a housing block, everything is destructible and this is perfect for setting up ambushes. Fire a loud shot to attract nearby enemy units and lead them to a gas station, then just sit back and enjoy the fireworks or cause a mess and activate your cloak or hide inside smoke grenades and catch the enemy off guard from behind. There is something extremely satisfying about controlling a giant mech obliterating everything and everyone around you just for the sake of a higher paycheck.\n\n[h1][b][u]Final Thoughts:[/u][/b][/h1]\n\nWhat Brigador does it does exceptionally well. It\u2019s an extremely engaging, challenging and rewarding isometric shooter that gives you the freedom of tactical approach. Cloak, flank your enemies and get out of there before they know what hit them, or pick up a giant metal machine of destruction and raze everything to the ground. You are a Brigador and you must fulfill your contract by any means necessary.\n\nPresentation wise, I really like the way the neon lights and the spotlights on the vehicles light up the way ahead of you. The explosions and debris flying everytime something blows up, the lasers, the projectiles, everything looks so vivid and hectic, just what you\u2019d expect from a post-totalitarian scenario! I\u2019ve also been hooked on the soundtrack and I\u2019ve been listening to it even when I\u2019m not playing the game, it is just a plain joy to listen to. You can listen to some of it here: https://soundcloud.com/makeupandvanityset/sets/brigador-ost\n\n[h1]In short, it is a brilliant mindless shooter which could\u2019ve been much more if it offered more depth to the world of Solo Nobre and its characters.

A bit remeniscent of the old Sega Genesis Strike series (Desert Strike and its successors), Brigador puts you as a lone vehicle in a big, hostile world with your choice of main objectives to complete as well as resupply locations and optional side missions that can help limit the enemy's ability to respond to you.\n\n  Simple controls- move, aim, shoot, and a defensive power- belie the underlying complexity brought to the table by noise, line-of-sight, variable armor facings (side + rear == more damage taken), a shield overcharge mechanic, and terrain offers varying degrees of toughness, resistance to being shot through, and hinderance to mobility.\n\n  When you start the game, you'll feel like you're undergunned and under-armored, with no way to do better.  Give it an hour or two, however, and you may find yourself sweeping the entire map and leaving fully shielded and loaded with every optional objective completed, and ready for a harder difficulty.\n\n  Negatives?  One complaint, and one warning.\n\n  The only real complaint I have is that there is exploding terrain that will do massive damage to you, and is relatively hard to see.  Nothing like spending 30 minutes carefully clearing a series of maps only to fail because you didn't see a muted green pipe or muted yellow gas canister against the overwhelmingly dark gray-brown-green background.  Realistic or not, these things need to be more visible.\n\n  It's also worth noting while that you could spend a loooooooong time unlocking all of the vehicles, weapons, pilots (difficulty levels), and maps that the game has to offer, Brigador is fundamentally a fairly compact experience.  The vehicles and weapons do handle significantly differently, but after a few hours of feverently playing the game I find myself feeling like I've gotten most of what I can get out of the game.  I would like to revisit it some more, but I'm a bit burned out.\n\n  Brigador is, however, a game that knows exactly what it wants to be and executes on it very well.

Despite being taking up a small portion of the screen, you feel like a powerhouse firing your cannons, howiters, rockets, and machine guns at the enemy forces, watching them and anything near them melt, crumble, and explode. It's all backed up by a 80's synth soundtrack that just works amazingly well for this hard to label aesthetic. Also, the levels are bladerunner-style gorgeous and you will enjoy purposefully or accidently blowing them up.\n\nGameplay - It's fast and frenetic, but the best part is how varied it is. Each mission lets you pick from 4 different pilots/vehicles, and the vehicles vary by tank, hover (agrav), or mech... and each with it's own set of main, secondary, and defense weapon. Stopping there would be fine, but then there is freelance mode where you use your merc money to buy vehicles, weapons, and pilots to build your own fighting machine and take on some generic missions. Don't let the word \"generic\" fool you, it's still a lot of fun!\n\nStory - It has one, and it is written well. It left me wondering if I was really helping the good guys, which I enjoyed. It is all presented in text format, but I'm not putting tat down at a negative considering the price of the game again.\n\nTHE BAD:\nCertain levels can be a bit frustrating as you immediately get swarmed by enemies after aggro'ing the first group.

If you're looking for really good ones, the field gets even smaller. I hoped Ironcast might scratch that itch, but it was far too random and skinner boxy in design. Then I played Galak-Z, and found the controls too finicky and your character too under-powered to enjoy it for long.Then I saw this game, which looked interesting enough to wishlist. I considered whether to get it this week or not, and eventually decided to take a chance on it. I'm quite glad I did, since it's a game easily worth fifteen dollars and its full price.\n\nBrigador takes place on the colony planet of Solo Nobre, whose Great Leader (who seems to have led exactly the same kind of regime you'd expect from a name like that) has recently died. As you might expect, quite a few factions descend on the planet in order to gain it for themselves. You play as a mercenary, or Brigador, working for one who want to liberate the planet from what's left of his regime and anyone else trying to take over - by any means necessary.\n\nYou accomplish this through a campaign of twenty-one missions, each of which require you to either destroy certain buildings, take out machines piloted by officers, or just kill hostiles until the game's satisfied. Each one gives you a choice of four different vehicles, each with a different pilot, pair of weapons, and a defensive measure such as a smoke launcher or EMP wave. How you control your mech or tank is probably a pain at first, since they all operate on tank controls except for the anti-grav weapons, which automatically point towards your cursor. This is the same way Galak-Z controlled, but here it feels like the game is designed around it more. The setting too, as unlike Gundam or Macross where a genius pilot can take down overwhelming odds, here it's more like the Votoms series, where pilots fight for money, self-preservation, or the thrill of it instead of heroics. Since you're playing as a bastard, you'll have to fight like one too.\n\nThe game gives you plenty of ways to do it. Sneak up behind enemies and blow them apart before they can turn on their shields. Lure them past an exploding bit of the scenery and use it to take out a whole squad in one go. Some mechs have a camouflage system, letting you just walk up and stomp enemies to death if you're so inclined. Every bit of scenery is destructible, allowing you to take whatever shortcuts you want or just blow off steam. Encouraging this are enemies that can raise the alarm, aggroing all the enemies and making them throw up their shields, so anything with that label becomes a priority target.\n\nCompleting missions in the campaign gives you money you can spend on the game's other draw, freelance mode. There you can challenge a series of campaigns you need to complete all in one go, using whatever combination of vehicle, pilot and weapons you like. There's also a randomizer option for a pseudo-roguelike experience.\n\nOverall Brigador's a quality experience, and there's no game on Steam quite like it, which is a rare thing to say. The controls take a little getting used to, but the difficulty curve is pretty smooth, and you feel pretty slick once you get the hang of them. There's an option to slow the game down a bit in the options now, and the developers have mentioned they're going to look into absolute controls (ie, like your average twinstick game), although I don't know how much that would improve the game. They seem like quite a nice, active team, so it's unfortunate they still haven't made back their investment producing the game.

Upon seeing the Steam Videos, I knew I had to buy the game.\n\nWhile not perfect, the game is [i]easily[/i] worth $15, perhaps even $25, and I do not regret my purchase. (In fact, I am going to give the devs more money and buy the OST.)\n\nThere is nothing like it in the market. \n\nThe game is best described as a real time crossover of Jagged Alliance and Mechwarrior. You get to pilot Tanks, Mechs, Hovertanks, of differing sizes and strengths, in various missions encompassing a variety of locations, from agrarian outskirts, to stereotypical surburbs, to dense (and very retro) metropoli.\n\nDid I mention most of the map is fully destructible? Hide behind a skyscraper as an enemy tank column rolls by. At the right moment, trigger your Audio-kinetic pulse, instantly demolishing the entire block. As the hapless crews scramble to battle stations, you take advantage of their thin rear armor and open up with your chaingun. [u]Take no prisoners.[/u]\n\nOutside of the campaign, you can choose your own mix n match set of equipment, weapons, and chassis.\n\nThe custom soundtrack, while only 2 hours long, fits the game incredibly well.\n\nPros:\n-Wide variety of different (and viable) builds catering to different playstyles for each player.\n-Incredible detail. Your hovertank bobs up and down, and it's shadow changes based on the bobbing. Acceleration, speed, and turning are all handled wonderfully. Some terrain has effects on travel over it, just like in real life.\n-Huge variety of weapons; varying from direct fire plasma cannon, machine guns to burning-gas dispensing artillery & laser shotguns.\n-Huge variety of chassis; including tiny 1 tread psuedo-motorcycles, giant mecha the size of an apartment building, the ubiquitous (and awesome) hovertank, to a mobile siege tower (mounting decorations made of junked cars, to boot) the size of a miniature skyscraper.\n-Interesting and detailed lore, obviously the product of feverishly dedicated worldbuilding.\n-Environment works exactly as you'd expect. A tall mech can shoot over a small building, then when the enemy returns fire, crouch to evade (and let the house/apartment act as cover) while your weapon cools down. Baiting an enemy vehicle column through a gas station or ammunition dump is intensely satisfying.\n-Amazing (if short) soundtrack.\n\nCons:\n-Pink Menu UI gives headache. Sorry, I'm not hugely into retro.\n-In Game UI/HUD feels unpolished, crude and insufficiently informative *and* overbearing at the same time.\n-Visibility is awful in many parts of the game. First campaign mission, for example, you don't really see what's going on until the end of the bridge.\n-Game somewhat favors the \"charge in and kill stuff\" style against long range sniper/artillery or even hit and run styles; the reammunitioning system and lack of innate shield regeneration basically require you to get close and personal to make the most of battlefield resupply.\n-Lack of Campaign flexibility. I'd love to go through the campaign with gear and equipment I've purchased for myself, mix and match depending on the mission requirements. Luckily, you can buy \"the Campaign\" in Freelance mode.\n-Pilot System. When I first read the game, I assumed pilots would give bonuses based on specialization. For example, one of the Spacer pilots is clearly noted to \"prefer long range engagements\" and I'd assume she'd give something like +Acc bonus to long range weapons. Instead, pilots are simply a difficulty multiplier.\n\nAlso, while I am aware that this would be near-inpossible due to custom-built engine, the concept behind the game (isometric customizable war machines with a variety of styles/builds) would have been perfect for multiplayer.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend you give this game a try.

It's perfect for those who love mechs and blowing up everything. The pros significantly outweigh the cons (in fact there's only one con, in my opinion), but I'll list them anyway:\n\n[b]PROS[/b]\n[list]\n[*]Gameplay is challenging yet fast paced, so if you fall you can immediately get back up and try again. You are rewarded for victory, and even slightly rewarded for failure, so even the most pathetic attempt at a map will net you some monies to buy the next awesome mech.\n[*]There is a significantly larger variety of vehicles and customization options than I thought there would be. There are three types of vehicles (mechs, tanks and anti-gravs), but each type has several faction variants with unique loadout options. The variety of weapons is nothing to scoff at, either.\n[*]Controls, once mastered, add a layer of complexity to gameplay. Shooting, for example, requires more than just aiming in a given direction - weapons shoot in an arc, so not only must you shoot in the right direction, but you must also aim the end of the arc as close to the enemy as possible to actually hit them. An interesting mechanic for sure.\n[*]The art style is very unique, colorful and smooth. I particularly enjoy the pilots' portraits for some reason.\n[*]The soundtrack is incredible. The 80's gritty synth tracks are very entertaining to listen to, so much so that you might be tempted to up and buy the OST, as I am.\n[/list]\n\n[b]CONS[/b]\n[list]\n[*]I enjoy reading up on the lore of a new game, and this game is chock full of it. However, the lore entries and even in-game text seem a bit scatterbrained. It's hard to explain - it's as if the game's copy were written by someone who is very proficient in English but does not speak it natively. There is some very intersting word choice and sentence structure that makes some codex entries difficult to read. But this is just me being nit-picky, so don't worry about it.\n[/list]\n\nOverall, this is an excellent game.

I just spent all night blowing up city blocks and mechs while playing with a new loadout, which was a ton of fun.\n\nSo, Brigador: the best description I've read about this game is that you're playing as Solid Snake while driving a giant metal death machine. It's a tactical game about carefully destroying squads of enemy tanks and mechs before they overwhelm you, and then spending the rest of your time destroying the beautifully hand-crafted maps.\n\nThere's a huge amount of content, from the large campaign to the unlimited Freelance mode. The campaign offers a set of maps that you tackle in order with preset mechs. There are four per map to choose from, which often translates to figuring out four different ways to solve the map - some mechs can turn invisible and stealth their way through missions, others explode everything around them. Not to mention the different guns/movement-styles/amount of armor they'll have. Not that you're forced to play through each map four times! Clearing it once is enough to unlock more maps.\n\nFreelance mode, on the other hand, strips away any limitations: choose your pilot, mech, their weaponry, special defensive skill, which maps you're fighting through, and go to town. In this mode you focus on clearing one of three objectives in several maps in a row, and if you finish it successfully you get a large payout.\n\nAh, money: that's the plot and your motivation to keep playing. Plot-wise you're a mercenary on a world embroiled in a civil war, working for a corporation that wants the place leveled by any means necessary. There's no quibbling over motives or means: just destroy things and get off-planet with your millions in hard-earned cash. As for the money in-game, you use it to unlock more weapons/mechs for Freelance mode, as well as a neat smattering of lore and intel - descriptive pages about the mechs you're piloting and the locations you're destroying.\n\nSo that's the gameplay. What's left? The graphics are gorgeous, highly detailed little environs that are satisfying to level. The mechs are varied and interesting to look at, and the UI is slick from the color scheme to the menu design.\n\nThe sound is absolutely top-notch with professional musicians providing a synthwave soundtrack that feels perfectly at home in this futuristic war-torn world. I listen to the soundtrack often away from the game just because it's so darned good!\n\nAnd, ah, the controls: in a game with tanks, the tanks control like tanks. This can be awkward at first, and probably off-putting. Please stick with it! I promise you the game will click for you, and soon you'll be driving around like you were born in a mech. The anti-grav tanks control slightly differently as well, as they orient wherever the mouse is pointing, but again - after you master the learning curve they'll work. (Also, the devs have mentioned that they're looking into adding \"absolute\" controls, for those who just can't make the leap.)\n\nWhich leaves...difficulty. The game is hard. It expects you to think and learn on the fly. Fortunately there are two major aids for those of us who aren't good at action games: first, there is no penalty for failing a mission. You'll have to do it over, but you don't lose money or ever make negative progress.\n\nSecond, there's a game speed option. This is the crutch I needed: it slows the entire game down to 50%, is fully customizable, and you can change it on the fly. It's meant for playing the game with a controller, but also acts as a difficulty setting without reducing complexity. It made the game far more tactical in my opinion, and gave me time to process what was happening on screen. (60% is my ideal speed - fast enough that things happen, slow enough that I can think about what I'm doing next, and thus lure enemy mechs into traps.)\n\nSo, that's a whole lot of words about Brigador! It's really, insanely good. There's nothing quite as satisfying as luring a whole pack of mechs into a dark alleyway as you open up on them with dual machineguns.

You can also unlock (or rather buy) new pilots that function as a difficulty setting in the game. A more difficult pilot means more and tougher opposition but also a greater paycheck IF you manage to reach the spaceport and make it off-world in one piece. \n\nAll this corporate killing is represented in stylish retro '90ies graphics and goes along with a great Synthwave soundtrack. The soundtrack is available as DLC to listen to in your own living room and there is even an audiobook with great immersion and lore (which i HIGHLY recommend you listen to - it's awesome!). The audiobook is also available as an e-book. Even though bigger games came out this year, \n\nBrigador is definately my personal GOTY (Game of The Year) title of 2016. I have more then 70 hours put into it and i still find myself coming back to it for just one more run. It is original, stylish, has original gameplay mechanics and (while it might seem a bit difficult at first) i would definately recommend you pick it up!

horrible control design\n- story told through expository passages\n- lack of character interaction\n\nI have spent a long time deciding how to approach this review. As a huge fan of the MechCommander series, and isometric games in general, there is a lot to love about this game: intricate pixel art, newly built mech engine, deep storyline, great soundtrack, lots of replay value, approachable despite its depth. But for all its triumphs, there are some notable setbacks.\n\nI can only imagine the courage it takes for a newly formed indie developer to create a new game engine from the ground up. A five year endeavor by Stellar Jockeys, Brigador has been a long time in the works and that work shows. I can\u2019t recall the number of times I stopped to appreciate the level of detail. From mission structure to game mechanics to the surprisingly great AUDIO BOOK?! (more on this later), so much thought went into this game.\n\nAt its core, Brigador is a mission-based, real time, tactical mech game split into two game modes, Campaign and Freelance. In campaign mode, you begin as a soldier piloting a mech at the exact moment that the \u201cgreat leader\u201d of a planet wide totalitarian dictatorship has perished (not so subtly based on North Korea). The story then plays out in a string of missions depicting your desertion from the regime as you fight your way to becoming a brigador, a mech-piloting mercenary.\n\nIn reality, the campaign exists to get you acquainted with the game world. It\u2019s where you discover whether your preference is sneaking your way through missions as you strike targets with surgical precision, or stomping across the battlefield, dismantling all that would oppose you.\n\nAnd Brigador gives you that freedom. Impressively, the game engine is built as a mech sandbox: enemies perform patrols and exhibit behavioral patterns, mech and weapon choice affect how detectable you are by the enemy, and environments are fully destructible allowing you to forge your own path towards objectives. Once you are comfortable with the game\u2019s foundation, your career continues as a mech-for-hire in freelance mode, arguably the heart of Brigador.\n\nSurprisingly, the campaign acts as a prologue to Freelance mode. Freelance mode is all about the minutiae of mech-piloting. No longer restricted to the predefined load-outs offered during the campaign, the player is free to customize every facet of their mech: pilots based on skill, mech bodies of varying strengths and weaknesses, bi-pedal motion or hovering, weapons based on ammo efficiency and damage type. In short, parting out your ideal mech is where you'll spend the majority of your time.\n\nAs much as there is to say about the game, even more can be said about its atmosphere. The entire game plays out at nighttime, with lighting effects to match: enemy spotlights cause debris to cast shadows, industrial locations are bathed in an orange glow. Sound wise, hauntingly synthesized electronica elevates Brigador\u2019s entire soundscape. Seriously, the soundtrack by Makeup and Vanity Set stupidly good.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, an audio book can be purchased alongside the game, allowing you to delve deeper into the game world\u2019s origins. In a way, Brigador follows a three act structure, with the audio book serving as Act 1, the campaign as Act 2, and freelance mode as Act 3. It\u2019s all kind of meta in a way.\n\nBut the game\u2019s atmosphere doesn\u2019t remain unbroken. It\u2019s clear that certain sacrifices had to be made, limiting Brigador\u2019s engine. For instance, every level is a completely flat surface suspended in a black void. The game (sans audiobook) is almost entirely devoid of personality. There\u2019s a complete lack of character interaction and the only story to speak of is a page of text that immediately precedes each level. But most egregious are the controls; they\u2019re tank controls.\n\nI get the rationale; it\u2019s a make a mech game with a control scheme to match. But tank controls died for a reason and should stay dead. Simply put, they\u2019re fucking horrible. Movement in relation to the character, not the camera, was a necessity at the time, but a mistake today. To make matters worse, it doesn\u2019t have just one set of tank controls, but two. Depending on the type of mech you\u2019re using, you either turn left/right or strafe left/right. Even after playing through the entire campaign, I still felt like I had no control over my mech.\n\nDespite all it has going for it, Brigador ultimately feels like a game out of time. What would\u2019ve been a great game ten years ago, feels like a good game today. Oddly enough, while the controls stop me from playing the game, they don\u2019t stop me from enjoying the soundtrack and audio book. It\u2019s strange to say, but I think they both turned out better than the game.\n\nhttps://voxludicus.com/2016/08/08/review-brigador/", "timestamp_created": 1470696980, "timestamp_updated": 1470697332, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.563154", "comment_count": "10", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24783659": {"recommendationid": "24783659", "author": {"steamid": "76561198166620870", "num_games_owned": 298, "num_reviews": 102, "playtime_forever": 561, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501456832}, "language": "english", "review": "One of my favorite single-player indies this year.

With more lights and more destruction and way less story. I'd like to have more story, but as a culmination of my ever-lingering hope for a game in which I can go around and level a city-block in neon lights and in which the map tells a story of a location which turns into a war-zone.\n\nIf you love the visuals of the trailer and destruction of buildings I would hope, that you like Brigador.

Handy firing arcs are shown for both the primary and secondary weapons. The AI isn\u2019t smart as much as it is numerous. Adept use of the controls, along with intelligent use of special abilities and weapons, is key to success.

As flamed as I was by the community for suggesting improvements, it seems the devs took note (of mine or others criticisms), and added much value to this game. As a result it no longer feels \"rushed out of EA\", and is well worth your time. I will leave the old review as it still has some relevence.\n---------------\nRushed out of EA and not sure why. A few more months, a little more feedback and I think this could have been a real gem.\n\nThe game has a cool story trapped behind a cold game menu through which it is told. This is made more frustrating after they went to the trouble of having someone write and voice an audio-book but didn't include a single sound bite in the game.\n\nThere are a couple dozen unique drivers each with their own stories and \"traits\" that effect your final score. But those stories are so coldly told through the games menu that the driver becomes nothing more than a score multiplier.\n\nA few cut scenes similar to what you might find in cryptark or invisible inc. Simple text and pixel portraits could have really gone a long way in connecting the player with the avatar.\n\nThe unlock system feels a little blind at times, you'll often spend a mill on some lore and a few mill on a driver only to feel like you just stuck your hand in a lucky dip or played pin the tale on the donkey, with the only consolation being that all the prizes were pretty crap so what difference does it make what you get.\n\nNow if the lore had been audio logs, or part of the audio book along side the menu text, it would have been worth a mill.. and that driver, if it came with 3 or 4 personalised text boxes expressing their motives for risking their lives, placed next to their portraits at the start of the first 3 or 4 Freelance missions I took 'em on, maybe I'd care about them and be inclined to learn about another.\n\nSome of the stories told through the menus are emotive but feel like a chore to connect with. It's a real shame.\n\nThe game looks great imo, music is perfect, it's that new retro wave.\nControls are perfect imo also, some people complain about them, but if you give them a chance and think about the logistics they work well and make sense.\n\nIt's in the variety of vehicles and weapons that this game really shines, while missions can feel similar (due to having little to no investment in any of the characters or the story), it's the loadout that makes a run unique. Vehicles have their own feel and can't all support the same mounts, so with weapons ranging from explosives with arch like firing arcs to machine gun lazers, there is absolutely an incentive and desire to experiment. \n\n+ Beautiful game, lovely lighting\n+ Lots of unlockables\n+ Great ost and sfx\n+ Lots of lore (though poorly implemented)\n+ Fun guns\n+ Strong level design\n+ Interesting vehicles\n+ Fair amount of content\n+ Multiple ways to finish your mission\n\n- Feels rushed\n- Some bugs (known about since EA)\n- No ability to zoom in on the lovely pixelated mechs and weps, not even through the Acquisitions menu\n- Poor use of wonderfully crafted lore\n- Missions can feel the same, with little to no investment in any of the characters or the story\n- No Auto forward key (trust me it needs one)\n- No level editor\n\n7.5/10 Pretty good, could have been so much better.

It's difficult in that the levels present challenges that force you to think about your approach; you can zoom in and lay waste, but you better be prepared for the backlash.  Or take it slow and pick off groups.  Best to get good at both though, as the campaign mode will demand it.  Freelance mode gives you a chance to customize your loadout and play with exactly what you want, but also to experiment and try new combinations.\n\nAnd it shines with the combinations.  There are 4 vehicle types, many vehicles per type, and multiple weapon classes to load up with.  All weapons, not to mentuion the vehicles, have their pros and cons, although I'm fond of the war-crime-in-a-can that is the Ploughman.\n\nThe atmosphere is the big standout for me.  It's set on an isolationist totalitarian planet where the leader has just died, and a mercenary group has decided to take advantage and destroy not only loyalist targets, but competitors as well.  The visuals, details, and especially the music stress the amorality of your mission and your actions, and the game is richer for it.  \n\nJust so this doesn't seem overly fawning, the controls do take a little getting used to.  It does use tank controls, yes, but you are driving futuristic tanks, so I can't really fault them there.  The enemies do have a tendency to swarm after the first few shots, but the devs seem to be working on that, and honestly, it makes sense that firing heavy artillery draws attention.  Really, it's difficult to call them faults so much as an acquired taste.\n\nSo all in all, I recommend Brigador to anyone who likes a challenge, and especially anyone who likes the cyberpunk aesthetic.", "timestamp_created": 1467490693, "timestamp_updated": 1467490885, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.995006", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24001345": {"recommendationid": "24001345", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023503614", "num_games_owned": 236, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 531, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496718334}, "language": "english", "review": "Gimmie that badge", "timestamp_created": 1467420086, "timestamp_updated": 1480015907, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532651", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23980501": {"recommendationid": "23980501", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018009591", "num_games_owned": 343, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 85, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467826383}, "language": "english", "review": "This game right here is why i prefer to search the \"Early Access genre\"\n\nSet in a Neon Futuristic destructable world\ni <3 that it has Mechs!\nThe music is perfect for this game\n\ncontrols maybe take a couple whiles to get used to but nothing that time, practice and effort won't cure\n\ni have to credit my friend for getting me this\nnow i have to remember to get the OST and Audiobook\nthats next on my todo list", "timestamp_created": 1467368175, "timestamp_updated": 1467368175, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502262", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23979660": {"recommendationid": "23979660", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992757219", "num_games_owned": 629, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 38, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467286150}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this!

IMO it really adds to the feel of the game, you're piloting gigantic steel mechs and tanks and it should feel like it. Not enough media these days treat giant robots with the weight they deserve.\n\nThe graphics are amazing. Brigador shot for a retro feel in many ways, and while they certainly nailed it on all fronts, both the art direction and the technical bits are something to behold. Loading up the game and playing it, I don't feel like I'm playing a game from 2016. I feel like I'm playing a source port or a patched version of a late-90s game. The isometric view calls to mind games like Syndicate and X-Com (and strangely enough for me, Roller Coaster Tycoon), while the per-pixel lighting effects remind me of the mid-to-late 90s brief flirtation with voxels as seen in Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri and Outcast.\n\nThe atmosphere is all-consuming, the lore and writing is compelling, and I can't help but get lost in the world of Solo Nobre and its struggle.

Before that, I used to obsessively play Desert Strike on the Mega Drive. Now, I can play Brigador! Except not obsessively, because adulthood sucks. :(\n\nBrigador is an isometric, vehicle-based action game with light stealth elements and destructible terrain. If either of the two names above ring a bell, you'll have a rough idea what you're in for (although it doesn't play entirely on super narrow corridor maps like Future Cop). If not: you control one vehicle (a mech, tank, or jetbike/antigrav) armed with two out of ~40 guns (split into different mount sizes, with each vehicle having two predetermined mount types) and have to make it through a series of maps with escalating difficulty. The maps are all ridiculously beautiful, hand-crafted, neon-soaked, sci-fi urban/rural landscapes. The fights are fun and fast, and fairly tactical (especially on higher difficulties) since you have to make sure you don't get overwhelmed and that spotter units don't sound the alarm, which would make all enemies activate their shields and beeline to your last known location.\n\nThere are no RPG elements or anything, but completing an \"operation\" (a fixed playlist of anywhere from three maps with the option to quit and cash out early, to \"run through all 20 maps twice over with ever-escalating difficulty and no way out until you beat the entire run\") or the campaign missions will reward you with Solo Nobre Dollars you can spend on unlocking new guns (of the 40, only 6 are available from the start), vehicles (there's 45 or so total, and the starting mech is one of the best vehicles in the game), operations (so you can play to earn money to unlock harder operations to earn more money) or pilots (the game's difficulty selection mechanic - each pilot has stats that dictate the difficulty of the first map in an operation, the difficulty increase per subsequent map, and a payout multiplier at the end of the run, so you can control difficulty in a farely fine-grained way).\n\nIn short, it's a fantastic game with great visuals, a ton of replayability and that is just generally really fun to play. The tank controls for all vehicles (except for antigravs, which can strafe, but with A/D always read relative to the vehicle orientation instead of the camera) take a little bit of getting used to, but once you've mastered them, you'll feel like a complete badass, stomping around town in your 200-ton superheavy mech with two artillery cannons strapped to its back and optical camo.", "timestamp_created": 1467188997, "timestamp_updated": 1467188997, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.529264", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23918260": {"recommendationid": "23918260", "author": {"steamid": "76561197982003581", "num_games_owned": 434, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 509, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500204387}, "language": "english", "review": "it's good. i got my key from a dude dressed as a soldier at pax. i have now shot both tanks and floating tanks.", "timestamp_created": 1467188450, "timestamp_updated": 1467188450, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23913858": {"recommendationid": "23913858", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999482693", "num_games_owned": 263, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5485, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4, "last_played": 1514338804}, "language": "english", "review": "Five hours in, and I love this damn game, no matter how much I suck at it.", "timestamp_created": 1467172199, "timestamp_updated": 1467172199, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23913634": {"recommendationid": "23913634", "author": {"steamid": "76561197969569833", "num_games_owned": 357, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 224, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496545518}, "language": "english", "review": "Ran out of ammo so I rammed an orbital gun only to find out they explode.

It demands a steady hand, cool nerves, and balls of steel and is uncompromising in its pursuit of delivering a tough but unique and stylish action game. There are still some rough edges, but I know that the creators are still hard at work adding the finishing touches to an already impressive title.\n\nSome words of wisdom for fans of games like Binding of Isaac and Enter the Gungeon: at a first glance this game might seem to have strange controls and a deceptive aim assist. Keep in mind that there are tangible benefits to having direct control on the direction your vehicle faces: you are vulnerable in your rear and sides but protected at the front, and the same goes for the enemy. Additionally, manual control of where your shots go is key to ambush and stealth tactics but also means you must \"think in 3d\" and adjust your shots to hit flying or small targets.\n\nUpdate: mainly doing this for the nomination stuff, but the recent content updates have been very enjoyable!", "timestamp_created": 1467167491, "timestamp_updated": 1480265671, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23911563": {"recommendationid": "23911563", "author": {"steamid": "76561197985659428", "num_games_owned": 236, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 6098, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505787366}, "language": "english", "review": "At first the game looks like a run n' gun top down shooter. It's certainly possible to play it that way, but you probably won't achieve great success. It's a little slower than that, a bit of a light sim. To truely shine you need scheme and ambush. Pop through trees onto unsuspecting baddies, dash around corners to stomp sentries to death before they can call for help, toss long bomb artillary from several city blocks away on top of a tank group, drop smoke and turn main street into a killing field, that sort of stuff. It becomes increasingly satisfying as these little thing become second nature, and you find yourself rending armies into heaps of burning wreckage without a scratch.\n\nThere's a lot to do and unlock in this game. There's the standard campaign mode where on most missions you'll choose from one of four vehicles as a sort of difficulty selector, and then the freelance mode with a seemingly endless combination of vehicles and weapons and dozens of maps. Enough to keep you busy for awhile. They did a good job on the varity of vehicles and weaponry as well. While some certainly feel similar to others they never feel copy pasted.\n\nI really like this game. It's great to hop into for 30 minutes and have a quick bit of fun, and it's also got that \"well just one more time\" hook that has you looking up and realizing you've been playing for 6 hours. It may seem a bit fiddly at first, but give it some time, get the feel for it, and remember that you're piloting a vehicle not hoofing it around. Be sure to try out all the different vehicle classes since they all control differently, and you maybe all thumbs with a mech, but a natural in a-grav. I'd personally recommend starting off with the tank type since I think it will feel more familiar to most people. Also the distance you aim controls the altitude of the shot, so if you want to nail that a-grav in your face you need to aim far past them.", "timestamp_created": 1467164503, "timestamp_updated": 1467164503, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23910800": {"recommendationid": "23910800", "author": {"steamid": "76561198102018512", "num_games_owned": 14, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 521, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489867517}, "language": "english", "review": "Look.

Brigador \u00e8 il loro primo videogioco \u201ccommerciale\u201d, rilasciato lo scorso 2 giugno; una versione alfa del gioco era disponibile gi\u00e0 dal 16 ottobre 2015.\n\n\n[h1]CONTRACTOR[/h1]\nBrigador ci mette nei panni di un Pilota detto \u201cContractor\u201d; firmato un contratto chiamato \u201cBrigador Action Agreement\u201d offriremo i nostri servigi alla Solo Nobre Concern (S.N.C.).\nLa S.N.C. paga profumatamente i suoi Contractor, i quali dovranno distruggere gli obbiettivi designati. La storia \u00e8 una mera scusa per far saltare in aria qualsiasi cosa ci capiti a tiro e il titolo di Stellar Jockeys fa ben poco per nascondere questa verit\u00e0.\n\nIl gioco si divide in una campagna principale ed una modalit\u00e0 Freelance.\nLa Campagna \u00e8 composta da 21 Missioni, dove si avranno a disposizione vari veicoli tra cui Mech, Carri Corazzati e Agrav (ibridi tra un carro corazzato e un velivolo). Ognuna di queste macro-categorie contiene veicoli diversi tra loro, ma simili nelle propriet\u00e0 principali, per esempio i Carri hanno maggiore resistenza e potenza di fuoco, gli Agrav sono pi\u00f9 agili e veloci, i Mech sono una via di mezzo con una notevole potenza di fuoco in alcuni casi, o maggiore mobilit\u00e0 in altri.\n\nIn entrambe le modalit\u00e0 di cui sopra, per ogni missione (o contratto per essere precisi) compiuta guadagneremo crediti (completare obbiettivi secondari, o semplicemente distruggere strutture, nemici, etc., aumenter\u00e0 notevolmente il numero di crediti guadagnati) che potranno essere spesi per sbloccare nuovi piloti, veicoli, equipaggiamenti, missioni per la modalit\u00e0 freelance, informazioni addizionali e lore.\n\nLa modalit\u00e0 Freelance, a differenza della campagna, offre la possibilit\u00e0 di modificare a piacimento i veicoli a disposizione, oltre alla possibilit\u00e0 di scegliere il pilota che pi\u00f9 ci aggrada, ognuno dei quali ha delle sue caratteristiche uniche. Di fatti \u00e8 proprio in questa modalit\u00e0 che il gioco d\u00e0 il meglio di s\u00e9, poich\u00e9 avremo la possibilit\u00e0 di creare la nostra macchina da guerra definitiva.\n\n\n[h1]NON \u00c8 TUTTO METALLO CI\u00d2 CHE SI ACCARTOCCIA[/h1]\nPurtroppo per\u00f2 manovrare i veicoli di questo gioco basato sul twin stick control risulta spesso macchinoso e/o ostico, quindi sopratutto con veicoli pi\u00f9 lenti si rischia di essere spesso intrappolati dai nemici senza via di scampo.\nSicuramente con la pratica, e anche grazie alla personalizzazione dei veicoli, questo problema pu\u00f2 essere risolto, ma considerando che morendo si perderanno tutti i progressi svolti in una certa mappa, alcune missioni possono risultare  alquanto frustranti, soprattutto per quei giocatori che non intendono affrontare un alto e impegnativo grado di sfida cimentandosi in un gioco simile.\n\n\n[h1]LA GRAFICA NON \u00c8 TUTTO, ANZI\u2026[/h1]\nDal punto di vista grafico Brigador non riesce a (o forse semplicemente non vuole) competere con altri titoli isometrici anche pi\u00f9 datati. Stellar Jockeys ha puntato pi\u00f9 sul comparto audio con tracce originali stile neo-anni 80 (per rendere l\u2019idea: lo stile di Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon) davvero avvincenti ed appropriate oltre ad ambientazioni fantastiche, le quali possono essere completamente rase al suolo. Ricordiamo che in passato altri titoli hanno trovato fortuna proprio grazie a questi due elementi (e non per la grafica) come ad esempio Hot Line Miami.\n\nInsieme al gioco \u00e8 possibile acquistare il DLC che comprende tutti i brani del gioco e un audiolibro che spiega parte della storia del gioco ampliando ulteriormente la lore dello stesso.\nInoltre le tracce del gioco sono anche disponibili in formato Vinile, a quanto pare solo per un periodo limitato di tempo.\n\n\n[h1]CONCLUSIONI[/h1]\nBrigador \u00e8 un buon scrolling shooter, divertente e teso. Il costo potrebbe sembrare effettivamente un po\u2019 elevato, considerando che non vi \u00e8 una modalit\u00e0 multiplayer, ma la variet\u00e0 di veicoli, e la possibilit\u00e0 di modificarli a proprio piacimento aumentano notevolmente la rigiocabilit\u00e0 del titolo (i completisti avranno un bel po\u2019 da fare per sbloccare tutto quello che il gioco offre).", "timestamp_created": 1467134614, "timestamp_updated": 1467135042, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504456", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23897774": {"recommendationid": "23897774", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960425808", "num_games_owned": 797, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1085, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3, "last_played": 1513915261}, "language": "english", "review": "A shining example of a true labor of love.\n\nReduce whole neighborhoods to no-man's-land in this grim dystopian sandbox.

I've got five hours into the game as of the time of writing this, and I've barely been able to scratch the surface of the content available. \n\nI have two very minor points of constructive criticism, but neither one is likely to affect your enjoyment of the game. The first is that currently missions pay a pretty small percentage of their total value if you're unable to complete it or die. Normally not a problem, but due to the way missions unlock in Freelance mode it wouldn't be a terrible thing if even just the first few missions had a higher rate on your return for failed missions. \n\nThe second minor quibble and the one I do care more about is that while the mechs sound fine, there wasn't much impression of weight. This is probably a really difficult balance to reach, as I can honestly only think of one game where characters/vehicles that were supposed to be incredibly heavy actually sounded it (Warhammer 40k: Space Marine). Given that, I wouldn't be heartbroken if that change went unimplemented, but adding some weight to the mech sounds would really put the sound design over the top.\n\nLike I said though, both of those were minor issues.

As a person who reviews games for a living, I don't ever review them seriously on Steam. I'm changing that because this game is great, and deserves more hype behind it.\n\nHere's the deal. Brigador is a wonderful, plucky game. It mixes and matches genres, grabs you by the face, and slams you back into the 1980s view of what 2100 should be.

Makeup and Vanity Set released music that I think is on-par with the soundtrack of Hotline Miami 2, which is one of my favorite albums ever. Not just \"video game music\" album, but music in general. That's what this soundtrack is like. \n \nDo I have some critiques? Yeah, sometimes I find that the game is a little heavy on keyboard controls, feels like a roguelike minus the turn-by-turn playing.

It's reminiscent of a number of games I played on the Playstation 1 in my youth, being straightforward at least on the surface, with a dystopic aesthetic and lots of explosions.  Brigador hits all those points, and even adds some to the overall formula.  There's a huge range of vehicles and weapons to choose from, catering to a wide variety of playstyles, and the freelance mode includes random maps and enemy positions.\n\nGameplay is surprisingly sophisticated, despite looking initialy very simple.  Controls are pretty straight forward: aside from moving and shooting with wasd and mouse respectively, there are two weapon buttons, a special equipment button, and then a melee/charge.  And that's pretty much it.  Mechs have a crouch button that lets you reduce incoming damage, but I forget about it half the time and have no trouble.\nWhere the sophistocation comes in, is in destruction and in game sound.  Weapons make noise, which can alert enemies.    This is in part a hazard, shoot your guns to recklessly and everyone on the map will charge you in seconds, but it can be used to your benefit as well.  You can use the sound your weapon generates to draw enemies into killzones or away from objectives, and holding fire is a valid tactic to avoid detection.  It's not quite possible to actually complete a level using just stealth, but with a little patience and observation you can completely control the pace of combat.  Terrain is also almost completely destructible.  As well as adding some fun visuals to the combat, as the districts will inevitably lose buildigns snf parts thereof as the battle moves around, this allows new angles of approach, such as shooting through terrain to attack from cover if your weapon has the penetration, or making a new entry way into a fortified area or a corridor to hid in or lure enemies down.  Add to this varying weapon trajectories, ammunition amounts and flight speeds, the end result, simply put, a lot of options.\n\nThe game is not perfect.  While I like the world building they've done, the campaign is really just a series of challenges and there is no story to speak of.  It works well as an excuse for the destruction, and the writing in the descriptions is ranges from mediocre to good, but people looking for an epic tale will need to go elsewhere.\nGameplay can get a bit cluttered as well.  It can be easy to lose track of which way your legs or treads are facing in the middle of combat, causing you to run toward rather than away from the city sized tank bearing down on you; and many times I've tried to shoot around a corner only to have my cannon clip the side of a building I'm using as cover, which at best wastes some ammo and at worse catches me in the blast of the shot.  Some of the premade vehicle builds in the campaign can be pretty frustrating to use, especially for some of the levels in which they're available, but that's just a nitpick, as there's no stage that needs you to play all vehicles, and at least on in each level is straightforward to play.\n\nOverall this is a game I heartily recommend if you're looking for some no-context destructive fun.  Simple to get into but with a lot of nuance and aspects to learn, I would say it's well worth the price.", "timestamp_created": 1465682932, "timestamp_updated": 1465682932, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.613432", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23492764": {"recommendationid": "23492764", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005278852", "num_games_owned": 224, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 3731, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510406246}, "language": "english", "review": "Brigador is a niche game, aimed at ceratin types of player. If you're not the target audience then you won't get much out of the game, but if you are then you're in for a treat. If I had to describe Brigador's game dynamic in one sentence it would be this: It's a game that allows you to revel in mindless destruction but rewards you for deeper tactical thinking.\n\nOn the surface the game is pretty straight forward: a twin stick shooter where you pilot a warmachine in a city full of hostiles with the goal of fucking shit up. However the core mechanics go deeper than the label \"twin stick shooter\"implies. For one thing there are three controllable vehicle types: mechs, tanks and hover-tanks (agravs) each with different control schemes and inherent abilities. Tanks work the way you'd expect, mechs can crouch down to lower their profile as well as perform a melee stomp action while agravs can fly over low obstacles and side strafe but have no independently tracking turret. Height is an important factor as well; if you're using a big mech or a tower tank your weapons fire from on high and can draw line of sight over shorter pieces of cover, on the flip side it becomes harder to target small units as they get closer to you.\n\nThe use of terrain is important too. Almost all the maps are a variation on a congested future cityscape. The terrain is dense but also destructible. All vehicles have the ability to destroy terrain just by driving into it so navigating the various walled off sections of the map is not a problem. Wrecking the terrain is also a satisfying activity, however certain terrain pieces will explode when destroyed, killing you in one hit if you're next to them, or wiping out your shield and reducing you to a sliver of health if you're lucky. Learning which terrain pieces are explosive has to be done by trial and error.\n\nBut the terrain is more than just something there for you to destroy. Smart use of terrain can provide cover against powerful enemies or be used to funnel swarms of enemies into a choke point. On harder difficulties taking advantage of terrain is essential to survivial.\n\nThe game comes with two modes: Campaign and Freelance. The campaign can be seen as an assortment of tutorial and challenge missions that familiarise you with the gameplay and sometimes offers an interesting challenge. With the exception of the first few tutorial missions each campign mission lets you choose from a preset group of four pilots and their vehicles. This can be roughly interpretted as a difficulty level. You see not all the pilots or vehicles are equal. You want an easier time then choose the one with the heaviest vehicle and the biggest guns. If you want something harder then try the same mission using the guy with the dinky little treadbike. Completionists will want to finish each level using all four characters but for the rest of us completing the mission with only one is sufficient to advance the campaign. \n\nFreelance mode is where you'll sink countless hours in. Here you can pick a pilot and vehicle with a customisable loadout to undertake an operation. An operation is series of missions across different sectors in the game's fictional city of Solo Nobre. Each mission follows the same format: There are three primary objectives: Destroy all the anti-orbital cannons, kill all the leader units or wipe out the majority of the local enemy forces. You need only complete one to advance to the next mission but if you complete them all the rewards will be higher. Complete every mission in the operation without dying and you will be rewarded with money that you can use to purchase more vehicles, weapons, pilots and more challenging operations. However if you die at any point (even right at the end) you will only get a tiny reward.\n\nFreelance mode really lets you tailor the experience to your liking. I was surprised to find that all the lighter units in the game cost more to unlock than the heavier ones. Then I realised it was not because they were better, it was because they were more challenging to play.  Pilots determine how difficult the enemies get. Some pilots fix the enemies at a ceratain level while others start the difficulty low and cause it to ramp up as the operation progresses. This really goes a long way to tailoring the play experience. If you want an easy game choose a low level pilot, a big heavy vehicle and a short operation, but if you want a serious challenge, take on a long operation with a tiny powersuit. The hardest operation is something called the \"Closed Casket Special\"; It's 39 missions long and with no possibility for an early exit. I have no idea how the devs expect anyone to do that thing in a mongoose or troubadour.\n\nMy favourite part of the setting is the world setting and lore. Now the game tells you very little up front. You are a corporate mercenary on the backwater colony of Solo Novo tasked with carrying out missions the completion of which will aid the corporation in securing control of the colony. If you just want to play the game it will not trouble you with anything more than that, but if you look into the lore documents and pilot bios you will uncover the story of desperate people trapped on a shit hole of a planet between an evil mega corporation and a tyranical dictatorship. The three factions have a lot of personality and it shows in their vehicle designs. The Loyalists are the remnents of the local military and their units are tough and functional, the Corvids are a bunch of scrappy freedom fighters that ride into battle on improvised vehicles with oversized weapon mounts, The Spacers are arrogant offworlders that have the best technology and as a result their units have more powerful shields. The art style does a good job of conveying all of this while still looking \"\u00f6ld school\". On a side note if you enjoy the backstory and want more I recommend getting the audio book. The writing is decent and it makes for an entertaining (if somewhat formulaic) war story. The book ends on a cliff hanger and is apparently only part one. I hope the rest comes out soon and not as paid DLC.\n\nNow for the thing everybody critisises the game about: the controls and interface. The game goes to admirable lengths to make sure all the information you need is displayed in as elegant a way as possible however it's still hard to gauge exactly where a shot will land from the isometric perspective. This is esspecially annoyng since the game asks you to take height into account.  You learn to compensate for the perspective but sometimes I still have trobule using precision weapons in dense terrain.\n\nThe controls are hard to get your head around, or rather your muscle memory around since they are \"tank\"controls rather than \"cardinal\" controls. Pressing forward makes your vehicle move in the direction it's facing instead of up. This means you need to think about steering your vehicle and I just can't focus on tracking targets AND manoevering at the same time. Many times I've been shooting at an enemy and evading only to find that I crashed into a wall and got focussed down by mooks while I was focussed on shooting the big guys. This gets even more wonky when you're strafing with an agrav since pressing left will make it strafe to it's left not your left, effectively inverting the controls if you're facing down. As it stands I don't bother with agravs on higher difficulty levels. I mainly have to rely more on tactical positioning rather than raw twitch skill to win a fight. This is not game breaking per say, Brigador doesn't quite have bullet hell levels of incoming fire but if you get caught in a swarm of enemies the controls make weaving between them awkaward. One could argue that Brigador is meant to be a more tactical and methodical experience rather than a twich based one but I'd say your mileage may vary.\n\ntl/dr: Fun game, cool setting, great difficulty customisation, but controls are a bit wonky", "timestamp_created": 1465601934, "timestamp_updated": 1465601934, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23492724": {"recommendationid": "23492724", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987323362", "num_games_owned": 742, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 54, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1465746800}, "language": "english", "review": "Were you one of the blessed few to play Bedlam?\n\nWELCOME\n\nTO BEDLAM 3: THE BEDLAMINING\n\nPLAY THIS RIGHT NOW", "timestamp_created": 1465601741, "timestamp_updated": 1465601741, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23491384": {"recommendationid": "23491384", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010929879", "num_games_owned": 1023, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 698, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499884819}, "language": "english", "review": "Brigador is a love letter to an 80's mechanized neon future.\n\nOther reviews will better say what I could not so I just wanted to leave this here as a strong recommendation.", "timestamp_created": 1465595003, "timestamp_updated": 1465646718, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499915", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23489966": {"recommendationid": "23489966", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971499663", "num_games_owned": 453, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1246, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513018233}, "language": "english", "review": "Cyberpunk Desert Strike with a spanking synthwave soundtrack and a touch of nihilism!

This game is for you.\n\nPros:\n-It plays a little bit like a twinstick shooter, but with more complex aiming (the aiming is 3D).\n-There is a ton of customisation - you can choose your vehicle, weapons and a pilot in freelance mode. In campaign, you can choose between preset loadouts (different for each mission).\n-Your loadout can heavily influence your playstyle. You can be a stealthy hit and run bastard. You can speed around in a flying tank and avoid hits like crazy. Or you can pick some superheavy monstrosity and methodicaly annihilate any oposition with hard hitting doomsday weapons. The choice is yours.\n-Even though there is no difficulty setting, you can influence the difficulty by your loadout. In freelance mode, your pilot choice functions as a difficulty modifier.\n-The campaign is decently long and if you plan to finish every mission with every preset loadout, it will keep you entertained for some time.\n-Mission descriptions and encyclopedia entries are hillarious.\n-The music is great.\n-The audibook (DLC) reminds me of those old Battletech inspired books. Unrelenting torrent of action, mayhem, and cheese. Its a delicious junkfood for your brain.\n-It's visual style is great and it manages to strike perfect ballance between retro feel and responsive gameplay. Vehicles are sprites with very retro \"choppy\" animations, but the game itself runs at high framerate with all that responsiveness we want from our modern games.\n-Devs are active on the forum and they are eager to help with technical problems and bugs. And they are still working on the game.\n\nCons:\n-The game can be really punishing, before you get used to the aiming mechanics.\n-My cats hate the soundtrack.", "timestamp_created": 1465575842, "timestamp_updated": 1480099999, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23483373": {"recommendationid": "23483373", "author": {"steamid": "76561197966531791", "num_games_owned": 169, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 335, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508630072}, "language": "english", "review": "Cracking little retro game, gives me flashbacks to my old Amiga days its like a Mashup of Bullfrogs Syndicate and Sensible Softwares Cannon Fodder, if you enjoyed those titles back in the early 90's your going to love this!", "timestamp_created": 1465560744, "timestamp_updated": 1465560744, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494224", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23477868": {"recommendationid": "23477868", "author": {"steamid": "76561198258925379", "num_games_owned": 6, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 94, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1465696154}, "language": "english", "review": "very fun game.

Between me and a ticket off this rock is an up market walled off residential are where Great Leader housed a lot of the top brass\u2019 families. Now it\u2019s inhabited by a detachment of angry Corvid fighters sporting homemade mechs and tanks and a myriad of things in-between. Beyond that, a commercial district which also services the spaceport behind. Therein lies the goal.\n\nI cycle the Rounder\u2019s cloaking field and shimmy forward a few hundred yards. Before the field disengages I\u2019ve got the Zeus Railgun and the Crambo machine gun aimed at a squad of Corvids oblivious to my position.  The rail slug pierces through machinery and flesh alike, half the hostiles gone in a blink. I send the Rounder back and reengage the cloak as the remainder of the squad races towards my last known position. Instead of launching another precious slug I aim the Crambo at the fuel station that runs adjacent to the street. Second half of the Corvid squad evaporates in the explosion, except for some little mech that manages to get a signal out before I shred it.\n\nSirens.\n\nEngines.\n\nBig mechanical footsteps.\n\nSounds that are fine in moderation but as the saying goes, you can have too much of a good thing. I shunt everything into the engine and pull a hard right, plough straight through a concrete wall and burn towards the spaceport. Every street I pass by is chock full of armour, far more than the contract suggested. The outside of the tank flares blue as tracer fire is deflected away from the hull of the tank. Rockets streak overhead cratering the path I\u2019d taken. Buildings collapse and explode and then sixty seconds later I find myself in sight of the tug that\u2019s going to take me to orbit, along with mech nearly as tall as an orbital cannon. A mech that has two Zeus railguns like mine.  Aimed at me. They flash.\n\nInstinct kicks in. The barrier between my flesh and my Rounder tank disappears. The first slug blows the shields out while the second blows at hole somewhere in the hull that lets light from outside leak into the cockpit. Sparks shower my bare shoulders, the smell of burning metal fills my nose. Somehow the cloak still works and I disappear. The mech\u2019s torso swivels, trying to recapture a lock. Instead of turning tail I tear straight for it. My face slams into the control panel as the tanks hull impacts the mech\u2019s leg, it stumbles. I fire my final rail slug point blank into its ankle.\n\nAnd that\u2019s what a couple minutes in Brigador is like.\n\n10/10\n", "timestamp_created": 1465409408, "timestamp_updated": 1465409408, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500772", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23445086": {"recommendationid": "23445086", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088822603", "num_games_owned": 491, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 3765, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510019368}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun times mech game with a great aesthetic and awesome soundtrack.", "timestamp_created": 1465350331, "timestamp_updated": 1465350331, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500717", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23436258": {"recommendationid": "23436258", "author": {"steamid": "76561197975879307", "num_games_owned": 344, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1246, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510403531}, "language": "english", "review": "surprisingly deep and complex gameplay systems make this game a delight, albeit with a steep learning curve. the controls for the huge variety of vehicles and weapons are rather unique for a game viewed from an isometric perspective but, when mastered, prove to be immensely satisfying.\na detection system involving sight and sound (vehicle and weapon noise) and its huge importance for successful runs is fun to figure out and use to your advantage.\n\nthe game contains a challenging campaign featuring preset vehicle loadouts and a freeplay mode with tons of lovingly designed maps and unlockable pilots (difficulty modifiers), vehicles and weapons. additionally, the developers promise to add additional campaigns and a map maker once the release version has been polished.\n\nincredible sense of atmosphere and a fantastic soundtrack.", "timestamp_created": 1465311743, "timestamp_updated": 1465329195, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23425866": {"recommendationid": "23425866", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993661434", "num_games_owned": 4088, "num_reviews": 102, "playtime_forever": 1143, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496436158}, "language": "english", "review": "[i]Review updated! The Developers listened, if not to me, but to people generally, I want to thank them, marry them, do many romantic things to them. THANK YOU[/i]\n\n[H1]Cyberpunk mech drama in a town that wants you out of the way.[/H1]\n\nFirst and foremost, this isn't the mech game that Mechwarrior purists are looking for. It has [i]elements[/i] of the things that a Mechwarrior type gamer would be looking for, and it may appeal to those kinds of players, but it's not an actual Mechwarrior game. This is still very much a twinstick shooter of sorts, but with a more deliberate, thoughtful take, where the choice of mech, pilot, and loadout does factor into the difficulty of the run through the city. You'll be managing your ammo and making sure your shots count, you'll be prioritising your targets, and the mechs, tanks and antigravs all look and -feel- very different from one another, but this is [i]not an actual Mechwarrior[/i] game.\n\nFor that, you'll want the game that Harebrained Schemes are brewing. That, is going to be the game that the Mechwarrior mech-heads are all looking for, I've backed it to the Valhalla tier and it's looking mighty fine. But enough of that, Brigador is a different and very unique beast. It's definitely interesting, but is it good?\n\nThe answer? -mostly-\n\n[H1]It's got all the fundamentals of a twinstick, but...[/H1]\n\nFirstly you'll have to make some fundamental adjustments, you do not have \"cardinal\" controls, you can't just use WSAD to direct the mech in the eight directions as you wish, instead the game uses \"tank\" controls, with A and D rotating your vehicle, and W and S making it travel forward and backward along the plane it now faces, there's a spotlight which helps keep you orientated but make no mistake, this does take time to get used to. For people used to traditional twinsticks where your controls are a 1:1 analog of what's going on, this is a shift you'll have to adapt to. \n\nUntil the most recent patch, this was your sole option, and it was a bit of a mixed bag but now? CARDINAL DIRECTIONS ARE IN BABY, and what's more you can have \"True upward\" for WSAD or \"Isometric upward left/right\" for if you're more used to that line of thinking, which is perfect. More options for various players is JUST what the doctor ordered. Suddenly this game has gone from niche to being accessible to everyone. If you like and feel tank controls are atmospheric, go nuts, they're still there, but for people like me who just can't handle them that well, I have an option that removes that issue, and being able to know that W means \"up\" on the screen makes life so, so much easier. Gone is the hitching on the interface, now I can really cut loose!\n\nAlongside this there's an angle to compensate for when aiming weapons, as denoted by the red and blue \"aiming\" angle markers, which help you adjust for aiming at things which are shorter than your vehicle or antigravs which might be at a horizontal level and thus need you to adjust accordingly. It's a learning curve, for controller inputs, I'd almost certainly want a \"Vertical auto-helper\" of some kind (and it does seem that there is now with the controller patch, but it's not a HUGE one, you'll have to do a lot of the work). It'd work on a steam controller, but not on an Xbox 360 controller. On the mouse? It's easy and intuitive, and you get used to it fast.\n\nOnce you've set your controls up you'll be piloting the mech in good order, and working through a neon saturated Blade Runner take on a city that frankly would rather you were not in the area. Your initial options are designed to ease you into the whole \"murder everything that's not you\" process, with good loadouts, plenty of armour and shield, and a healthy dollop of firepower available. As you generate funds and unlock more options, you'll be able to load your vehicles with laser weapons, gauss rifles, mortars, chainguns, and all kinds of good stuff, and you'll be able to go for lighter, more maneuverable frames, at the cost of armour.\n\nIn effect, you get to dictate how tough your run is, by choosing the mix of pilot, vehicle and weapons. This part is inspired, and I commend the developers for giving the players a really diverse and flexible toolset for deciding just how much stress they want to be under in a given run. Want to relax? Pick a heavy mech and a low difficulty pilot, get some big guns and blow the whole city up. Want to test your mad skillz? Pick a powered suit and see just how far you get.\n\n[H1]Stellar sound and visual presentation combine to make for a gritty atmosphere[/H1]\n\nThe graphics are, for what is basically iso-pixel art, stunning. This is genuinely high presentation all the way through, and is reminiscent of titles like Crusader : No Remorse, and Syndicate, when 2D graphics enjoyed a rennaisance and people were creative with the resources they had available to them. The music is also a synth drenched call back to films like Blade Runner and genuinely adds to the atmosphere to the game, meaning the whole package is cohesive and the entire game from end to end has a real depth to it that really works.\n\n[H1]The Developers *listened to their customers*[/H1]\n\nCardinal controls MAKE the game accessible to everyone regardless of skill level, suddenly this game has gone from being a game I could like but couldn't love due to the fact I was fighting on two fronts, because the controls would fail me due to my brain telling my hands to do something and not getting the right result, and fighting the enemies in the game itself. Now? Now there's nothing in my way except the enemies and it is *glorious*. I am immersed in this world and it feels -alive-, I don't think about what I have to press to get my mech into a certain place, I just do it. With the controls update, this game just went up in my esteem from a game I might play once a week to a game I'll play nightly. Now it's much easier to get your teeth into, I REALLY suggest you do as well.\n\nVerdict : [b]Essential[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1465251664, "timestamp_updated": 1472305210, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.591602", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23418245": {"recommendationid": "23418245", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993630200", "num_games_owned": 206, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 3657, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 40, "last_played": 1513178639}, "language": "english", "review": "Very well-made game.

I'm not really sure why my modest-but-modern laptop was behaving this way with an isometric game, but hey-ho. The fantastic weapon sound effects and feedback feeds into this; it's hard to describe the gameplay in anything other than vague floaty terms like \"crisp\".\n\nOn the other hand, the 'campaign' (Which felt a bit like an extended tutorial to be honest) gives you a small selection of fixed loadouts and a mission to accomplish. I found it to be a bit short, although any longer and it'd probably overstay it's welcome. Only a couple of missions felt really distinct, like the one which starts you with no ammo, and you have to race to the end to pick some up. The rest of the missions sadly felt a bit samey, Futhermore, the challenge in these missions zig-zags drastically; I never really got stuck, but some of the earlier missions were rather tough, but the very last one was a cake walk. The factions you face in these missions clearly have subtle differences, but I never felt like the gameplay was telling me \"This is Faction X, this is Their Hat.\" On the other hand, you could argue that this means the various enemy factions aren't gimmicky.\n\nFreelancer mode is the real meat of the game. The only issue is that you have to accrue and spend limited winnings on equipment which has no description before you purchase it, so you either have to randomly buy bits and pieces and hope for something interesting, or hope you've used it the in campaign and know what it does. Most annoyingly, this post-release game (as of time of writing) still hasn't got all the weapon and vehicle descriptions in it yet.\n\nSo in summary, the gameplay is really good. The campaign is decent, but leaves you wanting more. That more can probably be found in Freelancer mode, but it doesn't tell you all you need to know in some cases, and is a bit grindy. It's good enough for me to comfortably recommend it, but I can't say \"BUY THIS NOW!\" until the weapon descriptions are finished, and maybe they add some DLC content, built to the high standard of the base game.", "timestamp_created": 1465174715, "timestamp_updated": 1465174715, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.615852", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23406931": {"recommendationid": "23406931", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992961153", "num_games_owned": 263, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 540, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1465210433}, "language": "english", "review": "Very enjoyable game to play with a mixture of stealth and action.

Mother. Of. Christ!\n\nThis game somehow manages to be visceral while also making you play in a methodical, tactical manner. It's understated and yet bombastic at the same time.\n\nSimply put: play pre-made campaign maps to acquire money, use that money to purchase pilots, vehicles (mech/tanks), weapons and semi-procedural missions then mix and match for huge replay value in the freelance mode. It's a super simple career-esque formula that feels like an arcade version of MechWarrior Mercenaries and I love it!\n(NOTE: I say \"career mode\", but it really isn't that deep, don't expect a management game here).\n\nCombat is satisfying and varied due to the wild loadout combinations you can create; fast, light mechs with heavy weapons, giant, slow walkers with enough \"dakka\" to put the greenskins to shame and any variation in between. I personally recommend the 'Fork' mech with dual 'disco' turrets (example [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycpGvL_hRQY] here[/url]).\n\nThe game is not easy, but at no point does it feel unfair. It can be difficult to get the hang of aiming at first, but all the projectile arc information really is right there in front of you, so it doesn't take long to figure out. As long as you don't rush in and try to take on swarms of enemies all at once you should be good. Just like MechWarrior Online, this is a form of cover shooter; sneak behind buildings and only engage when you've got the advantage. And speaking of buildings, everything is destructible... and I mean everything.\n\nIn conclusion, it's a simple isometric mech/tank action game with some light customisation, fully destructible environments and a great synthwave soundtrack.

En effet, si on se fait trop rep\u00e9rer, on d\u00e9clenche une alarme g\u00e9n\u00e9rale qui va nous envoyer tous les ennemis du niveau d'un coup!\n\nLa r\u00e9alisation de Brigador est excellente avec un c\u00f4t\u00e9 r\u00e9tro assum\u00e9 et une ambiance au top gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 la bande son parfaite pour ce genre de jeu. La maniabilit\u00e9 est tr\u00e8s bonne m\u00eame si il faudra pas mal de temps pour s'habituer aux d\u00e9placements. En effet, on contr\u00f4le son v\u00e9hicule au clavier et \u00e0 la souris avec des touches configurables. La souris nous permet de contr\u00f4ler la partie haute du v\u00e9hicule, les tirs et la comp\u00e9tence alors que le clavier nous permet de d\u00e9placer la partie basse de notre robot. Si tout ceci peut paraitre facile, il faut comprendre que l'on ne peut avancer le v\u00e9hicule qu'en pressant la touche Z, les touches Q et D font pivoter l'axe du v\u00e9hicule. Il faudra donc toujours avoir l'\u0153il sur la partie basse de son v\u00e9hicule pour voir dans quel sens on se dirige. La barre Espace permet de d\u00e9truire le d\u00e9cor ce qui est pratique pour se frayer un chemin. Certains v\u00e9hicules sont d'ailleurs plus difficiles \u00e0 contr\u00f4ler mais on s'y habitue assez rapidement mine de rien.\n\nPlus on r\u00e9ussi de missions et plus on gagne de cr\u00e9dits, cet argent nous permettra de d\u00e9bloquer des missions, des pilotes, de l'\u00e9quipement mais aussi des m\u00e9chas. Ils pourront ainsi \u00eatre utilis\u00e9 dans le mode Freelance. Rien qu'avec ce mode de jeu, il y a des heures de fun et d'amusement \u00e0 pr\u00e9voir. Un gros m\u00e9cha \u00e9quip\u00e9 de 2 tourelles laser? Pas de probl\u00e8me! Brigador est un excellent divertissement mais il nous oblige aussi \u00e0 bien r\u00e9fl\u00e9chir sur son armement et sur la bonne fa\u00e7on d'appr\u00e9hender les combats. Les munitions ne sont pas illimit\u00e9es et on ne peut recharger qu'\u00e0 certains moments et endroits. Certains ennemis sont plus difficiles que d'autres \u00e0 d\u00e9truire et il faudra bien utiliser les munitions optimales. Le camouflage sera votre meilleur ami afin d'\u00e9viter certains secteurs trop difficiles, il s'active avec le bouton du milieu de la souris et ne dure que quelques instants. La difficult\u00e9 est tr\u00e8s \u00e9lev\u00e9e mais elle reste raisonnable une fois que l'on arrive \u00e0 bien comprendre les d\u00e9placements et \u00e0 ne pas rentrer dans le tas.\n\nBrigador est vraiment un tr\u00e8s beau jeu dot\u00e9 d'un moteur custom et d'une possibilit\u00e9 de destruction infinie! Autre gros point fort du jeu, la musique! Que dire de cette bande son si ce n'est qu'elle m\u00e9rite \u00e0 elle seule l'achat et qu'elle apporte vraiment un \u00e9norme plus \u00e0 l'ambiance et \u00e0 la coh\u00e9sion de l'univers. Dans peu de temps, on devrait voir d\u00e9barquer un outil de cr\u00e9ation de carte qui promet l\u00e0 aussi des grands moments de solitude et de difficult\u00e9. Il n'y a pas grand chose \u00e0 jeter dans Brigador!\n\nBrigador est une excellente surprise pour moi! J'avais beaucoup aim\u00e9 la version Early Access mais la version finale est d'un tout autre acabit. Le jeu est \u00e0 la fois impitoyable mais aussi juste ce qui \u00e9vite au maximum la frustration et qui nous pousse \u00e0 toujours jouer plus et \u00e0 essayer de nouvelles combinaisons de M\u00e9chas et d'\u00e9quipement.

I'm assuming you've watched the trailers and are familiar w/ the basics of the arcade-style shooter genre.\n\nGamplay: \n\nUPDATE: With the release of the full game, the quantity of vehicles and weapons available to the player in campaign and freeplay mode have increased greatly.  Whereas the EA was working w/ about a dozen vehicles and weapons, there are now 4 or 5 times as many.  This obviously makes for a much more replayable game; figuring out optimal builds for each vehicle and which vehicles suit your playstyle has become a much richer experience b/c of the increased variety. You can choose to play either through the game's 20-mission campaign which follows the story of liberating Solo Nobre as a mercenary, or play one-off missions in the game's freeplay mode.  Any currency gained from either mode carries over to the other and allows the player to purchase intel, vehicles, weapons, lore, and different pilots for use in freeplay. I think this mechanic works well as it doesn't lock the player in to playing strictly the campaign, everything in the game is accessible at all times, provided you've racked up enough currency from completing missions.    \nEARLY ACCESS:I've been having a ton of fun w/ Brigador; it's relatively simple in gameplay, but w/ depth of difficulty and strategy that emerges the longer you play.  I was up and running w/in a few minutes of booting this game up for the first time, but even after 20 hours or so, I'm still learning about the nuances of each vehicle and weapon available in the game, as well as enemy behavior and countering tactics.  \n\nAudio: \n\nUPDATE: Following the full release of the game, music and sound effects have been more fully integrated into the game. Updates include a greater quanitity of vehicle and weapons sounds, as well as the integration of the full OST into campaign maps.  I can't overstress how much the original music adds to the experience of this game; if you're into synthpop, this game is just a joy to run around in.  \nEARLY ACCESS:The in-game audio pushes Brigador from something that I'd probably otherwise enjoy to a great gaming experience.  The music is a stand-out as contributing a great deal to the atmosphere and enjoyability of playing, but it's not alone.  The weapon and vehicle sound effects, automatic weapons in particular, are rich and obviously got a lot of love from the devs.  \n\nGraphics/Misc:\n\n\nUPDATE: Nothing much to add here over EA; I'll note that I haven't experienced any bugs or crashes.\nEARLY ACCESS: I've seen a few pre-release builds since purchasing and all of them show a great deal of attention to detail from level design to animation to UX: I've gotten a great deal of satisfaction out of how smooth the game's animations are.  I get the feeling that the devs took a great deal of time in getting vehicle movement and weapon usage right; I've seen other games that use mechs and tanks end up w/ much clunkier vehicle movement, which can kill the fun quickly. Every vehicle in this game has a realistic sense of movement and presence in the game world, as do environmental destruction and weapon effects.  Graphics options are limited to resolution, V-Sync, and a few other options, but I found that these options are sufficient.\n \nDevs:\n\nLastly, I always consider it a good sign when the developers of a game have a presence in the Steam forums and these guys are on top of that.  I've asked several questions and have always received quick answers from devs or knowledgable community members.  I always enjoy knowing that I can run to the forums w/ questions or comments and receive something other than a \"get gud\" response from the community.", "timestamp_created": 1464670799, "timestamp_updated": 1465921709, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.468318", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23222012": {"recommendationid": "23222012", "author": {"steamid": "76561197962289455", "num_games_owned": 594, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 2317, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509994492}, "language": "english", "review": "Have you ever had the inexplicable urge to spit upon your hands, hoist the black flag, and commit REASONABLY-SIZED ROBOT WARCRIMES?\nNow you can!\nPick from a bunch of pilots who range from \"literally the insane guy who built a killdozer\" to \"a sociopathic space corporate stooge\" to \"GLASSES GRANDPA, BEST PILOT EVER\"!\nPick from a moderately large pool of vehicles for causing DEATH AND DESTRUCTION on an unprecedented scale!

There's a lot more depth and immersion to it than I'd expected from an isometric shooter\u2014you can interact with any and every object in the map, which generally involves either smashing it or blowing it sky high. Some structures are relatively benign, others will explode and take a big whack of your shields out with them. So you'll want to start thinking at street level even as you take advantage of the top-down perspective to locate enemies and engage them on your own terms.\n\nBrigador is tough. Very tough. Like, approaching roguelike levels of hardness. There's no quicksave\u2014you either complete your run by escaping via the spaceport or you die in the process. This engenders a more methodical pace than you'd expect to see in your typical shooter\u2014cover becomes critical, and all your weapons make noise which serves to attract more enemies. As much fun as it is to Gatling Gun that MiniMart into rubble, letting everyone know where you are will get you swarmed by more enemies than it's humanly possible to fight off, losing you the game in a matter of seconds. So destroy responsibly.\n\nControls feel unworkably clunky at first\u2014using WASD and mouse for Resident Evil-style tank controls (to be fair, you *are* actually controlling a tank) takes some serious getting used to. Don't expect to feel very fluid with it for the first hour or so. After that you kind of grow into it. No controller support currently, but with the way aiming works I can't see how they'd ever be able to implement it anyway.\n\nI don't regret dropping $20 on Brigador despite it being unfinished at this stage\u2014though if you're on the fence you can wait until it's out of Early Access and judge the complete game then.

But thankfully this game is extremely easy to mod. I don't know anything about code, and I never modded any game before, yet in Brigador I was able to make an instagib mod, change all the weapons' attributes and make my own weapons, make enemies tougher, completely revamp the lighting, modify the movement behavior of all player vehicles and change the enemy spawnlists (and thus even get access to unimplemented content that was present in the gamefiles) - and most of those things can be done on-the-fly while in the game. On top of that there's a map editor as well. You could even make your own units, though for that you need experience in either 3D modelling or at least basic spritework - unless you're fine with recombining the existing leg and chassis parts which you can do pretty easily.\n\nIn short, pretty much every aspect of the game can be modified either in-game via a really handy and easy to use dev-console, or by basic text file editing in the gamefolder.

Turret is very rapid look and slightly delayed aim based on turret speed.  Since this is early release here are my comments:\n\n~ would like options on how ground/direction indicator is displayed; maybe bigger/color/brightness\n~ light enemy AI should have a higher priority on individual survival; seem eager to sacrifice self to do damage to player\n~ variable speed option; i think it would be fun to be able to play at 70% normal speed to accomodate how frantic you want the experience to be\n~ maybe auto-reload at depot and only require active when scavenging\n\nLooking forward to playing this as it progresses.\n\nUpdate:  Also hoding down 'e' will essentially make your feet follow your mouse view.", "timestamp_created": 1453903766, "timestamp_updated": 1453909422, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.614822", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "20615747": {"recommendationid": "20615747", "author": {"steamid": "76561197973755794", "num_games_owned": 332, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 406, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505101958}, "language": "english", "review": "\nI'll start by saying I have very little negative things to say about Brigador. The visual aesthetic; a  beautiful mash-up between classic 90's PC mech/strategy games, and the 80's neon retro-wave which has been coming back in a big way. Playing this has made me wonder why this pairing hasn't been before, as when combined with the amazing retro-wave soundtrack it makes an incredible overall look, sound, and feel. The HUD also feels pulled straight out of those old games, presented in a minimalistic fashion that fits perfectly. \n\nNow the gameplay is what makes Brigador truly stand out. The isometric view coupled with WASD + mouse will likely be slightly disorienting at first to those first picking it up. An hour or two into the game, there are moments where was still tripping up. Keeping evasive while also keeping on target is very challenging-- at first. Always keeping yourself properly oriented is a challenge-- at first. \n\nOh, and let's not forget about aiming and shooting. THAT was very hard to get the hang of. I'm still getting better at it, too, which is satisfying in the way that good, challenging games are. However, I DO believe that the \"aiming system\" can be improved. After the number of hours spent playing-- essentially the amount of time it took me to beat 'The Tears of the Ancestors' mission-- I'm still only 90% sure I'm going to hit a guy AFTER I take my time getting oriented and ranged in. The isomentric view makes some angles very awkward for aiming. \n\nThe only suggestion I can think of is to make the path of the projectile more clear by showing the point of impact. I will often overshoot or undershoot distant targets (with things like a basic tank-style cannon) because while I know my direction is correct, the \"height\" is harder to guage. \n\nAlso, that mission was damn hard. DAMN hard. My vast majority of my 4-5 hours played were trying to beat that mission. However, after finally beating it, I felt two things: a disappointment that I didn't get another story mission to beat myself over the head with, and an overwhelming sense of satisfaction that I managed to beat the stage by incorporating all aspects of the game's depth. \n\nI used stealth and evasion, shooting through objects such as trees and buildings to hit enemies that couldn't see me, to take on the overwhelming amount of enemies. It was incredibly satisfying to overcome the mission by playing smart. \n\nThat being said, I was still a little bummed out to have not gotten another story mission, but this game is in Early Access for a reason, so I'm not knocking the game or devs for it. Of course more missions/content and balancing will be coming.\n\n\nHere's a TL;DR to wrap it up. \n\n-The visuals and music are fucking incredible. \n-Gameplay is complicated and must be learned through practice.

The developers are actively following a development roadmap that sees them churning out maps and vehicles as they continue to build the game around the existing skeleton you can play here. Yes, the current experience is rough if you are expecting a paid beta experience: the menus are barebones, most of the sound effects are missing, there's a lot of functionality on the cards such as an unlock system and selectable pilots that we won't see for a while. That's okay, because it means the majority of work has gone into fine-tuning the game's systems to create an enjoyable and frentic experience best likened to a curious mix of [i]Syndicate Wars[/i], [i]Desert Strike[/i], [i]Future Cop: LAPD[/i] and the [i]Mechwarrior[/i] titles on the Super Famicom which featured similarly isometric views and wanton destruction.\n\nBrigador's difficulty is, once you're familiar with the simple controls and the flow of the game, somewhat self-imposed. You can identify pretty quickly which of the game's vehicles (tanks, mechs and antigravs) gels with your playstyle the most and then which weapons you find the most useful on top of that. Whether you go with the same pair of big, kick-ass cannons in every run or try to mix it up a little is up to you, and the vehicle mounts available. The longer you stick around, and the more maps you complete, the more difficult the enemies you'll find coming at you. If you're low on shields and ammo and aren't feeling like you can weather another big fight, the option is always there to hit up the spaceport as your next map and fight your way to an escape.\n\nThe soundtrack, by New Retro Wave artist Makeup and Vanity Set, is pretty damn good. It's not just playing at the 80's throwback fad half-heartedly, it's lurid and drenched in neon with big, dramatic synth. The only downside is the song selection is another aspect under development: the game just picks from a playlist right now and runs through it. What's there is great, though, and helps make up for the lack of sound effects currently implemented.\n\nThe game is by no means perfect, but it's short and sweet and to the point. For something so heavily under development, what's playable is incredibly crisp and very enjoyable. Whenever you die, it usually feels like it was something you did wrong rather than getting caught out by imbalanced mechanics or shitty bugs. The onus is on Stellar Jockeys to keep the pace of development up, because the quicker this game's skeleton is built on, the quicker the attention is going to snap to it. If you're scared off by the very minimal trappings of a game under construction then you probably don't want to buy Brigador just yet. On the other hand, if you like the idea of tossing some change to a handful of guys making a very earnest and solid shooter with a bumping soundtrack, go for it.

Brigador is an isometric vehicular shooter with fantastic production values and excellent look and feel.  The devs have focused early resources on the core gameplay, which is really quite good.  Even with the small subset of weapons and vehicles now available, the game manages to pull me back every so often just so I can experience that kick-ass, blow shit up feeling one more time.\n\nThat gameplay features a modest number of player vehicles which fall into three categories: Mechs, Tanks and Anti-gravs.  Mechs have high acceleration and modest speed, but have a powerful stomp attack that is devastating to grounded enemies and the environment.  Tanks can boost for short periods to plow through the same at high speed (although the 'Dragon' actually slows down, it pretty much obliterates anything it touches).  Anti-gravs are unique in that they turn their entire chassis to aim, but they can move in any direction and can float over short obstacles.  They also slam the ground, but typically deal substantially less damage than the mech or tank equivelant.\n\nThe weapons available have varying statistics of shield damage, hull damage, environment damage, penetration and rate of fire.  At this point, ammo doesn't appear to be used to balance weapons, but is simply commensurate with the rate of fire.  Each vehicle can mount two weapons.  Usually these are weapons of different size categories, but some vehicles have two of the same mount.  The weapon balance is currently spotty, due to the fact that the unlock system has not yet been implemented and we're likely several balance passes away from 1.0 as it is.  Some weapons are fantastically effective, like the tank cannon (can't remember its actual name), while others are less than spectacular (the 8mm burst-fire, for example).\n\nBrigador features a host of mechanics that really bring the visceral combat to life.  The AI is excellent in that it relies on line of sight, as well as the sound of weapon fire to locate the player.  The enemies start off basically flat-footed, many with their shields unpowered.  If you get the drop on them, you can take down quite a few hit-and-run style.  The moment you join battle though, nearby enemies will start closing in to investigate.  If you hide at this point, it's quite doable to avoid contact or better yet, lead your enemies into a killzone of your choosing.  Attacking enemies from behind is literally twice as effective as shooting their fronts, so it's often better to hit them on your terms than to simply charge into the middle of them.  You can use the environment to your advantage by setting off devastating chain reactions from explosive structures or by attacking the enemy through the very obstacles blocking them from returning fire.  Even the height of individual units is important, with the 'tower-like' enemies being able to spot and return fire over low-obstacles, whilst the tanks and infantry are stuck moving to get a shot.\n\nAs other reviewers have said, the price point is high for the content the game currently has, but let's be frank; This is Steam.  The dev needs to set their price point high if the game is going to display value to potential backers, and so that it can still be an equitable return when the inevitable Steam sales roll through.  It also means that they can get additional resources early on and not live in squalor hoping their game will make it big when it leaves early access, which we all know is /far/ from a guarantee; It's a fool's gamble.  For what it's worth, the game in its current state easily convinces me that the dev can fulfill their remaining content goals within the six months they've given themselves.\n\nEDIT: Oh, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the excellent original score.  It's a high-tempo, arcade-style throw-back to 80's action movies that suits the aesthetic and general tone impeccably.", "timestamp_created": 1446136869, "timestamp_updated": 1446137614, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "18722585": {"recommendationid": "18722585", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032049873", "num_games_owned": 670, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 1472, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504494698}, "language": "english", "review": "Finally finished a run.  ironicly it was with the loyalist light mech.  25mm autocannon.  76mm cannon, canister rounds.   it looks like a modded to hell and back tiberian sun.   i rrrrrrrrrrrreeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaly  like this game.  it just oozes awsome.  i'd really like to see a mulitiplayer version.....just no mircotransatcions plllease.  \n\n\n15/10  go buy it right now if you like mech games but have a patato as a cpu,   \n\ndamn fine game.   hope to see more soon.", "timestamp_created": 1446012450, "timestamp_updated": 1446012450, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "18720374": {"recommendationid": "18720374", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064987215", "num_games_owned": 23, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 57, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475327126}, "language": "english", "review": "Has the potential to be good, but not with those controls, put the option to have the classic WASD controls as optional and this game becomes good.

You can play brigador sneaky deaky like and cloak or if your the Arnold type rush in guns blazing.\n\nCurrently there are 9 vehicles to pilot ranging from hover tanks, to mechs, to something that looks straight out of a red necks fantasy... yep an el camino with a giant monster cannon.\n\nYour goal in one of these vehicles is to either sneak or shoot your way into various locations and destroy the glorious leaders cannons, generals, or just massacre a percentage of his army.\n\nThe controls are a bit difficult at first to get used to as you must handle your turret, your legs/tank (which rotate separately) while maintaining aim with your guns and their ranges. Meaning 3 things at once which I am rather poor at.\n\nIf this hectic gameplay isnt your style there are hover tanks you can use that have locked turrets. Keep in mind the developers have promised 40+ new vehicles coming before Brigador leaves steam early access.\n\nThat being said after a few hours with the game the controls get simpler. I found the sniping / sneaking gameplay to be my forte as it let me move slowly and set things up as opposed to the large hectic fights where I ended up slamming into the walls screaming at my keyboard.\n\nOverall I think Brigador is a solid game for being at the early stages of development. I do think the price point is a bit high but once the game is finished it will definitely be worth that cost.\n\nMy only real complaint with the game was the controls and thats more my fault at being an old man than the fault of the game.\n\nMy full video review is linked below\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJehhe4PT1U", "timestamp_created": 1445964216, "timestamp_updated": 1445964216, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 25, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.670494", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "18691054": {"recommendationid": "18691054", "author": {"steamid": "76561197965580729", "num_games_owned": 224, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 970, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494108733}, "language": "english", "review": "Good rogue like with an 80s scifi playground.

If you liked classic westwood C&C games environments, attention to detail and music, Brigador will likely give you nostalgia. If you simply like quick and easy to play action games like nuclear throne or spelunky, Brigador is going to appeal to the same style of fun.\n\nIn a way the game is incredibly simple, you can just run in and shoot things until you get to the end, but it's so well made that the simplicity only really helps the game. You pick a vehicle, two guns and a special weapon (I recommend smoke grenades with the tauro mech) and need to complete one of three objectives per area, all of which involve blowing things up. Enemy AI allows for you to either stealth your way in or out, maneuver your way around at high speeds dodging shots, or simply bust your way through walls crushing anything in your way. \n\nDespite all this, the game is tough: you cannot regain health at all except by killing enemies to regain your shields, so avoiding damage by killing fast or playing smart is essential if you want to get to the end and off of the planet. Ammo management is also an issue, as you need to either harvest it from your enemies without blowing it up first or regain it from depots that correspond to your ammo type, which are often surrounded by enemies. Keep in mind that if you don't need the ammo type, you can just use the depot as an explosive to still save you some shots. An added layer of difficulty comes from optionally playing as lighter, more agile mechs that definitely require finesse to control compared to other options such a pillar of scrap on treads. You can expect any vehicle to reward you if you use it right however.\n\nAs a game Brigador is definitely fun, as a mech game Brigador plain rules. The perspective, graphics, explosions, destructible environment and hordes of enemies you take down really make it feel like you're a piece of heavy weaponry and not just a reskinned human.

At the time of this review, the game is still incomplete but shows a lot of promise in it's well designed gameplay.\n\nBrigador is a challenging game to say the least. A player's first inclination is to shoot everything in sight, but you'll quickly learn that strategy will get you killed pretty fast. Your ammo is limited, your HP don't regenerate, and the game features a perma-death system. With out careful planning and strategic thinking, you'll become scrap metal in an instant. The game has a high learning curve, and an equally high skill ceiling. The game makes no concession to casual players.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Hf5arkwBc8&ab_channel=aldershot8008\nThe goal of the game is to enter an enemy territory, shoot out 3 of their cannons, and then get the hell out of there. It sounds simpler than it actually is. In any given map, there will be tons of enemies swarming to blow you up if you're not careful, as well as environmental hazards. Gas pipes, oil stations, and other things can easily blow up in your face ending your run. Then there are mud, tracks, and sand that will slow you down. Though there are hazards, the environment is completely destructible, allowing you to make your own path to the goals, avoiding the dangerous main roads. \n\nBefore even starting your mission, you'll be able to pick your vehicle, weapons, and special abilities. there are 6 different vehicles that are variations of 3 different types, tank, mech, and hover. Tanks have good Armour and speed, while mechs can use a powerful stomp, and hovers can strife and are the quickest, but they're balanced with low armour and HP. They all have their own unique characteristics and stats, and the same can be said about the weapons and specials as well. The game offers a fair degree of customization and experimentation, allowing the player to tailor their ship to their play style.\n\nBrigador also features detailed but visually clear sprites in an isometric environment. The aesthetics have a classic PC look to it, and it's one of my favorite elements of the game. The art is interesting, full of nuance, and does a good job at communicating it's overall theme and atmosphere of a dystopian future. The sound design is also quite pleasing, with an appropriately futuristic OST and sound effects that has impact. However, since the game is in early access, some sound effects aren't implemented and is distracting from what is an otherwise polished presentation.\n\nThere's a lot of stuff to like about the game, it's presentation, it's skill oriented gameplay, and the destructible environments, however in it's current state, the game does feel incomplete. Currently, there is only one mode to play, endless mode, nothing to unlock, no stat tracking, and no story mode. So basically, the game is bare bones feeling very very beta. Of course it's in early access and these things are to be expected, but it is something worth mentioning for any one expecting a complete game. Bragador does not feel complete. There is a lot of room to grow and I am excited to see where it goes. One feature I really would like to see added is some kind of multiplayer. But until the game is further updated / released, it doesn't give much incentive for the player to keep playing, other than it's core gameplay, and maybe experimenting with different combinations of weapons and ships. \n\nOverall, Brigador is a very promising game, that in my opinion, has the potential to be a cult favorite. All the game need to do now is to fill itself out a little. Give the player a reason to come back regularly. We'll see how it'll turn out once it's a full release, but so far, so good.\n\nPros:\n- Great classical looking visuals\n- Challenging and rewarding gameplay\n- Destructible environments\n- customization\n\nCons:\n- Missing sound assests\n- limited game modes\n- Feels incomplete\n\nBrigador hours played: 3\nCompletion Status on Brigador: N/A\nThis copy of The Brigador was given by the developer", "timestamp_created": 1445631341, "timestamp_updated": 1445631341, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504491", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "18642933": {"recommendationid": "18642933", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960875031", "num_games_owned": 944, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 530, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500669925}, "language": "english", "review": "good game, gauss is cool guy", "timestamp_created": 1445622277, "timestamp_updated": 1445622277, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497812", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "18630736": {"recommendationid": "18630736", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047722376", "num_games_owned": 643, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 213, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472420594}, "language": "english", "review": "Early Access Review:\nOne of the greatest looking isometric arcade-like games I've played in a while.

(like Locking enemy function, just for pc, as my memory :( )\n\nso like I say before, u dont satisfied with negative review, and u don't satisfied to make any change either. I dont think its so simple question about my refund (im not asking and i didnt ask for refund), if the designer is really thinking about the market things, really dislike the negative followed by the negative reviews, I think it's the time to take care of this problem seriously. i hope next time, when we talking in a not bad Atmosphere, the helpless things like \"I can't spend any more time to talk with u\" \"I dont believe u\" \"u just spend 48 mins on this game, I spend 3 years\",these things seems not need to appear anymore.\n\nso, in a simple way to say: I like this game, not worth $19, bad experience for control. hope to see more improvement", "timestamp_created": 1445448337, "timestamp_updated": 1480482780, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.442629", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18595333": {"recommendationid": "18595333", "author": {"steamid": "76561197964671373", "num_games_owned": 361, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1796, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499913707}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a very well made game even in the current early access state.

What it started from, the assets they hand crafted themselves (didn't borrow or steal), the fact they got a great musician that actually fit their game to work with the sound track and so forth sell me a game. I think of it as investing in someone's idea and dream as much as buying a product. They always chatted me up and answered my questions, so I  pre-ordered this long before Steam was even a reality. I'd probably give them a positive review even if the game were a steaming heap.... which it's NOT.\n\n[b]Controls:[/b]\n\nWhile this game can be a frantic iso-mecha-tric shooter, the controls are very much akin to tanks and mecha. Which means A and D will swivel the torso, W and S and will move front to back,  while mouse actually moves the aim. This takes quite a bit of getting used to, but tip is to look at the spotlights that the vehicle shines on the ground. One will be for the body/movement and one will be for aiming. The problem as it stands now is they can be harder to distinguish, become blocked by terrain/obsticles and generally get disorienting. I wouldn't have the game control any other way, however. It's true to the idea behind the vehicles and its something a bit fresher feeling over the generic point/click/move. There is a skill curve that makes sense and it's not just throwing square wheels on a car to make it harder to drive. This game will be something you will get better at playing as you play it. If you want a game you can sit down and be great at and win immediatly, then consider something else.\n\nTip: I'd recommend starting with the tank as the graphic serves a much better indication as to how to control it.\n\n[b]Tactics:[/b]\n\nThe control set actually lends itself to a slightly slower gameplay that requries a bit of tactical movement on the players behalf. This isn't a game where you will endlessly kill mindless enemies. Your ammo is quite limited, though can sometimes be refilled by random towers or rare drops. Position matters where you shoot the enemy. Charging things without considering that you are just wasting ammo by shooting them from the front is bad form. You do more damage from the side or the back, so dodging and timing shots can be much more benefical over going pure John Rambo. There are also \"Special\" weapons. Smoke bombs which obstruct enemy view so it can help escape and positioning. Camo for the sneaky type and EMP grenades that I just rarely use.\n\nTip: To save ammo, use your melee attack on smaller enemies like footmen and in desperation against light craft. Stealth can combine with this for fun results.\n\n[b] World Design [/b]\n\nIsometric was just a perfect choice. It's very reminiscent of the 16/32 bit era of \"Strike\" games which pleases me greatly. Everything can be destroyed and you can carve a path through the level with your machine. Each weapon can affect the enviroment differently and of course there's explosive structures that can be used tactically. \n\nTip: Blow everything up. It's cathartic.\n\n[b]Soundtrack:[/b]\n\nAs a huge fan of synthwave/cyberpunk music, I was already a fan of Makeup and Vanity Set. His soundtrack for this game just helps a great deal setting the atmosphere. It's always nice to see a game seek someone that works better than just getting someone to fill in because their cousin can make beats. The soundtrack is very much part of the game. It's not just an afterthought asset at the bottom of the budget. Devs take note!\n\n[b]Content:[/b]\n\nAs far as content, there is much much more to be added. I'll update this review accordingly to reflect this. Right now you can do basic runs and it's generally a sandbox with everything unlocked. You have complete mission freedom. You can kill a set number of enemies, find the commanders and kill them all or take out a few of the orbital cannons and advance to the next. In the future there will be unlocks and money as well as many more missions and tilesets. Also coming will be controller support, which may be a better alternative for the controls for some.\n\n[b]Verdict:[/b]\n\nA very thought-out design from top to bottom. The dev/brother team knew what they wanted to make and executed in a masterclass fashion. They have built an amazingly solid housing for their game. Now, the rest is just moving some more content into it and making the price tag more tempting.  The price doesn't bother me in the least. In a world of cheap sales, that only bring disposable titles or F2P games that are more timetraps than video games, I'd always pay premium for something like this. 20$ is hardly \"premium\" pricing though. I would have paid half that for the soundtrack alone.  This is a game I can revisit because after all it's actually a video game. Not storybook on rails or a grindfest because grinding because modern video games.

I really respect the devs for choosing to not color every explosive element red, although I cursed their names the first time i discovered this fact.\n\nThe graphics are excellent. I don't know what voodoo magic allows such accurate-looking lighting effects in a 2d game, but it is strong, and arcane. You really have to see it in motion to appreciate it. The overall visual density is high, and honestly pretty busy, but it gets much easier to read the action after a few games.\n\nThe game presents a stiff challenge, but not an unfair one.

Smoke is your friend!\n\nThere are six vehicles to choose from in the current build (there have been more in pre-release builds and certainly will be again) and many different weapons, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. This level of choice is one of the game's greatest strengths, but may also be the biggest stumbling block for new players, since it's easy to choose a loadout that doesn't have good synergy, and get completely owned.\n\nPro tip: try the loyalist mech \"Touro\" with the cannon \"Abbot\", machine gun \"Mae Dois\", and smoke launcher. It's a very powerful combo. But definitely don't stick to it!

I did a little bit of research and discovered the upcoming game, being developed a group of four guys under the name \u2018Stellar Jockeys\u2018, striven to be a isometric hybrid of \u2018Syndicate\u2018 and \u2018Mechwarrior\u2018. After reading that I was determined to jump into Brigador without any further knowledge of the game and see how much fun I had, and let me tell you; I had a ton of fun.\n\nDamn is Brigador a beautiful game. The game is set in the bright and bustling isometric cityscape of Solo Nobre. At launch there are nine very detailed levels/districts to Solo Nobre, each with their own unique but similar layout. At the beginning of each mission (dubbed contract\u2019s in the game), you choose from one of three categories: tanks, mechs, and anti-gravity vehicles. The tanks are typically defensive, the mechs primarily offensive, and the anti-gravity vehicles are fast. Each mech has it\u2019s own weapons and play style as well as toughness when taking damage.\n\nFrom here you\u2019re thrown into the contract you selected and begin dishing out massive destruction to anything and everything in the district. The entire map is fully destructible, including attacking enemy vehicles, all of the buildings and enemy defenses, and even the civilians attempting to flee the city from your carnage. There are quite a few unique weapons in Brigador, all of which take some getting used to. You move using the W-A-S-D and a mouse, but it\u2019s not as simple as it sounds. The movement is similar to Resident Evil in that you use the A and D keys to rotate your vehicle in places, W to move forward, and S to move backwards. You have a red and a blue line that project from your vehicle in different arcs and help show you where your weapons will be fired. Using this system you can aim high, low, and even around buildings to take out aerial or ground enemies at command.\n\nBrigador is tough. On top of the intricate(but fair)movement system, the enemies themselves are quite challenging. By design, there is no saving or restarting, so you must play through the district\u2019s clearing out enemies and completing the objectives of your contract to move forward. While keeping track of your ammunition is certainly important, there are ammo stations scattered across each map, and defeating some enemies will result in them dropping ammo packs to replenish your ammo. That being said, successfully completing a level carries over your current ammunition counts and health, meaning to \u2018beat\u2019 the game you would have to complete each district in one sitting and straight playthrough.\n\nIf you\u2019re a fan of isometric \u2018top down\u2019 shooter type games, Brigador is definitely for you. As I mentioned before, it\u2019s an extremely beautiful game, and a ton of fun. Destroying the city of Solo Nobre while wiping out your enemies and completing your contracts does require a bit of strategic shooting, but is enjoyable the whole way. While the game itself was a bit too difficult for me to successfully clear all districts in one sitting, I feel as though that\u2019s necessary with a game like Brigador. The only thing I\u2019d ask for is perhaps more of a story or campaign rather than just \u201cComplete Objectives in all Districts\u2019, but after playing through all of them there is definitely the feeling of some repetition.\n\nBrigador enters early access on October 20th at the price of $20 on Steam and Humble and plans to add more content throughout the early access stage.\n\nThis review score is based on its Early Access launch.

The visuals are good. The mechanics are good. The map design is good.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dl0O9iohLRw\n\nBrigador's a good mech game, which seems to be a rare commodity these days. It's an isometric shooter with systems bigger and more complex than 'put your mouse on the bad guy robot and press the button,' the biggest of which is the aiming system, since it's three-dimensional. You can overshoot or fall short of targets, and the camera works in conjunction with this. Unlike another recent top-down shooter with a banging synth soundtrack, the shifting camera won't give you motion sickness, and you won't get oneshot from offscreen. Differing armor values for front, sides, and rear (for enemies AND for players) means that flanking isn't just viable, it's vital, and different acceleration, handling, and speed while traveling in different directions in different vehicles means that even two vehicles of the same class feel and play differently. \n\nYour tower tank can plow through enemy and environment alike while absorbing blow after blow; your mech can peek and retreat around corners, fire over low walls or crouch to hide behind them, and stomp anything that dares get close; your main battle tank is fast and maneuverable with a low profile and a speed boost for hit-and-run attacks; and your antigrav can weave in and out of buildings, strafe targets without exposing vulnerable side armor, or belly flop on enemies who make the mistake of letting you get close. \n\nI've been playtesting the game since early alpha builds and the progress it's made is astounding. The game is gorgeous and never stops being fun to play. 60 hours later I still constantly get the itch to boot it up and throw together a new build to see how far I can get with it. There's really no game on the market that plays quite like it.

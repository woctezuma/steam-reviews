What is Chronicon? It's a top-down action RPG which borrows from many other popular games in the genre (primarily Diablo II & III), while offering a very laid-back experience which you can enjoy at your own pace.\n\nThe game currently offers 4 classes, and 5 difficulty settings. The primary archetypes are covered, don't worry.\n\nThe difficulty settings aren't just for fluff, they increase drop-rate bonuses at the risk of harder enemies as well as reduced player resistances. As an added perk, the best gear can only be obtained from the highest difficulty setting. (Also, the best items cannot be gambled)\n\nWhile the game does borrow from others in its genre, it manages to bring those elements into a very playable and addictive package.\n\nSo, you might be asking yourself, SELF! I've already played the 'greats' of the genre, is this game still worth it? \n\nYes, absolutely. The game is a steal at its price.\n\nIn conclusion, the title builds upon a very solid foundation of Quality-of-Life elements aRPG fans expect, while adding in some new surprises as well.\n\nI'd highly recommend this to anyone, fans of the genre or not.", "timestamp_created": 1514346374, "timestamp_updated": 1514346572, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38707244": {"recommendationid": "38707244", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995610689", "num_games_owned": 184, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 6323, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 176, "last_played": 1514316396}, "language": "english", "review": "I am really enjoying this game.

If the answer is yes then you've struck pixelated gold.  Chronicon was certainly inspired by some of these titles, most definitely Diablo 2.  Considering it's in early access right now, it really does not get much more polished than this. I have encountered perhaps one or two minor bugs.  The developer frequently communicates with players on the forums, listens to feedback and is incredibly receptive to it good and bad, no matter how critical.  He responds to you, questions your feedback and whether it would be included in the game, and works on reported bugs almost immediately.  You don't see this kind of interaction and dedication often anymore.  This guy is passionate about making his game into something spectacular.  This alone is a reason to buy the game; it feels good to support dedicated and hard working developers.  \n\nBack to the point though,  I've put in about 30 hours of play time and I've only made 1 character.  In fact, it took me about this much time to reach 100, the max level at the moment.  There are 3 other classes to experiment with, so the replayability is there in that regard.\n\nHowever, Chronicon suffers from a few issues that did not take long to realize.  The only big one seriously worth mentioning that may or may not ruin the experience for some  is the loot.  The worst part about the loot is that it becomes VERY redundant VERY quickly.  What does this mean? Well, you can come across the exact same unique type item 5 or more times in a two hour session.   You will hear a loud THUD in game notifying you that a unique or legendary item has dropped, then when you pick it up and find out it's basically the same thing from before... it's kind of disappointing and makes looking or grinding for loot meaningless and just not something you look forward to at all.  \n\nWhen you do happen to find a moderately good item it will be MARGINALLY better than your currently equipped one, even if your old item is 20-30 levels lower than your new item, the new item will hardly be an upgrade.  To make the new item worth equipping you will need to enchant it, modify the kind of sockets it has, reroll the attributes, and essentially fine tune the item at a vendor to your exact liking... this is a great feature but it's time consuming and feels like a cheap attempt at simply avoiding designing BETTER gear.  Also, there is no way to take gems out of equipment.  You can only destroy the gems and keep the item.  Why? This seems so backwards to me.  The polished variety of gems (the third tier and best gems you can acquire) must be crafted using lower tier gems and can be really costly/time consuming, because you have to farm for lower tier gems  before you can upgrade them.   \n\nI don't mean to sound overly critical here at all but this glaring issue with loot is noticeable fairly early on and gets progressively worse the closer you are to max level.  You would think different and considerably better loot is obtainable the higher level you are but in the grand scheme of things, it feels like the opposite. \n\nOne more small issue I have is the minimap.  You can shift between different sizes and where the minimap is placed in game.  The problem is when you want it to take up most of your screen, it is difficult to see particularly in certain environments while you're playing.  It could use a little enhancement I suppose because I've had to really focus on the minimap at points just to figure out where I'm going.  I realize it's not meant to be very bold or anything because it would get in the way of the game, however, there should be a balance between not being a distraction and visibility.\n\nDespite some of its flaws, which I'm sure will be worked on prior to official launch day, Chronicon is a lot of fun and can scratch that itch you've been feeling for a solid hack n slash experience. It's definitely a good time, easy to learn, has 5 difficulties and isn't complex or intricate like Path of Exile which to some may be a plus or a negative depending on what you're after.

It's a diablo style dungeon crawler with pretty much everything you would expect. Loot, Gems, Entchanting, Skill trees etc.  It's pretty impressive what the dev have done here, this game feels like diablo 2 and in some aspects even better.\n\nChronicon has 4 classes, all of them have a different source of energy for their abilities.\nThe appearance of the class depends on the number of skill points used in a specific skill tree.\nEvery class has class specific Items and Item sets. \n\nBerserker (your typical high dps melee brawler guy)\nWarden (a Hunter/ Ranger with some magic skills as well)\nTempler (your typical Tank/Dps/Heal hybrid)\nWarlock (Mage - the caster dude, any game needs one tho)\n\nItems in Chronicon have 6 different tiers: Ordinary, Common, Enchanted, Rare, Unique and Legendary. There is also a tier called True Legendary, which are items that can only drop when you have a character level of 100 and are playing on Legendary difficulty. \n\n\nYou will be extremely surprised how good this game is (if you like the artstyle of course !) \nIt is filled with content and I would pay 20 $ for this EA. (hell mabey even more..)\n\n\nSubworld is a one-man independent game studio based in Gothenburg, Sweden.\nIt has been run since its founding day in summer 2015 by Daniel \"Squarebit\" Stigsj\u00f6\u00f6. \n\nWith over 50 updates the dev is a working maniac and always lurking in the Forum, building the game WITH the players.\nHe is a prime example how early access is done right.

Smooth level progression with a completely bonkers amount of customization, abilities, talent trees, mastery trees, and an absolutely insane amount of useful treasure!  Treasure and item drops scale with player level, keeping legendary drops fresh at any level.\n\nThe menus and ui layout are a bit cumbersome at first, but with more customization options than any other game of this type, I was able to quickly setup a layout that was comfortable and familiar.\n\nI like the art design for certain things, but wish there was more animations, and also wish gear showed up when equipped.  As is, levels and monsters feel very static and lifeless, but it's still fun to try to run through slaughtering everything and gaining bigger killstreaks.\n\nThe sound is probably one of the weakest elements of the game, mostly feeling like placeholder, but hey, it works for now.

Here are issues I have with it when writing this review:\n\n- The start of the game gets easy fast, however suddenly the game ramps up and you'll die quite allot.\n  But if you keep going you'll get good loot and it becomes easy again. I am playing on the second highest difficulty and the only thing stopping me from playing max difficulty is that bosses take FOREVER to kill. The game needs a bit more balancing.\n- The font can be wonky sometimes because of the filtering. The bigger text has a strange font that seems a bit out of place, to me it doesn't really matter.\n- You can filter out equipment depending on rarity, but potions, scrolls and chest keys will always be highlighted. I wish health potions, mana potions, keys and scrolls of return where automatically picked up. That would make looting a bit less tedious. \n- There are no dedicated slots for items you always carry like health and mana potions.\n- Story text scrolls down far too slowly, making me skip all dialogs because my patience runs out.\n- The minimap shows too little and I end up having the big map overlay on at all times. It kinda gets in the way. A zoom slider and size for the map would really help.\n- The thick pixelated effects can really clutter up your screen, I wouldn't mind if they where the only thing not pixelated.\n- All other stat-changing potions have to be used manually. I'd rather have them used automatically.\n\nThere are things it does really well too:\n\n- Variety in color schemes of enemies depending on their elements.\n- Thick hordes of many, many enemies.\n- Lots of elements.\n- Three types of gems of ALL elements you can fit in 3 different types of socket. All gems also have 3 levels. Finally, you can put sockets on items whenever you want, irregardless of level.\n- You can make complex synergies with your attacks and set bonusses on your equipment.\n- You can upgrade, reroll and reroll the numbers of all secondary stats without being locked to 1 afterwards.\n- Endgame levels that get progressively more difficult. When you get stuck, you can lower the level of those levels with a scroll.\n- I love the music, the forest has my favorite soundtrack of the game.\n- Cool sound effects.\n- You get a satisfying explosion when you get a killstreak, it would be cool if there were more tiers though.\n- NO MOVEMENT SPEED CAP!

And this one is really fun and satisfying.\n\nYou pick between four classes: Berserker (melee fist-fighter), Warden (an archer, basically), Templar, and Warlock (combination of a mage and necromancer).  Each class has multiple talent trees you can invest points in that result in different active and passive skills and damage types.  I'd recommend trying them all; I typically dont like melee classes but I'm loving my Templar.\n\nYou start off in a building called the Chronicon, with a merchant and several other NPCs that offer services you can unlock as you progress.  You grab the first couple quests, and off to the dungeons you go.\n\nDungeons are filled with enemies (duh), loot from said enemies and chests (double-duh), traps, and mini-dungeon rooms.  Enemies can have different buffs applied to them or be a rarer quality which makes them give better loot or have different fighting mechanics; for example, one buff might make the monster explode after you kill it.\n\nLoot is broken down into tiers: Ordinary (white), Enchanted (blue), Rare (Purple), Unique (Pink), and Legendary (Red).  As with any other game, higher tier loot offers better stats and sometimes interesting passives, such as a pet, or a floating orb that does damage to targets near you.  Loot also consists of Crystals (currency), multiple tiers of multiple colors of gems, and some other weird crystal currencies I haven't found a use for yet.\n\nThe game offers 5 (I think?) difficulties, and I've been played on the third/fourth highest right from the start and the game feels balanced enough.  Rare monsters and boss fights will have you chugging hp/mana pots like no other, so make sure you buy lots from the merchant NPC.  Boss fights actually start to have mechanics once you get past the first one, so be aware of their abilities, how the combo them, when they're going to use them, etc.\n\nLocal multiplayer is REALLY fun if you have a friend to speed-run through the dungeons with and build up monster-gibbing exp combos.\n\nOverall this game is really fun, the pixel art is nice, and there are LOADS of puns and humor to appreciate (for example, a miniboss that's a Bat named Outahel.  Get it?  Or a treasure-hoarding goblin that drops a Unique ring, named Mollug (LOTR fans, anyone?).  The game is really charming, the music is relaxing and catchy, and the combat gets really fun.\n\nThat being said, here are my suggestions/cons:\n\n-Early game combat is REALLY dull.  The first 10 levels or so on a Berserker and Templar are especially boring.  You do very little damage, the only attack skill you have sucks, and drains mana like no other.  They really need to do something about the early-game.  The game should be fun right from the beginning, not 10 levels in; and some of the people in the reviews have mentioned this as well.  However as soon as you get your 2nd/3rd skills, fights get really fun.\n\n-The loot filter could use some work, and its buggy when you play local multiplayer.  When I use a keyboard and my gf uses a controller, after you defeat the first boss in the secondary zones I cant click the names of the loot to pick them up like 60-70% of the time like I usually can.\n\n-More classes would be nice.  Even if you had to split the Warlock into a Wizard and Necromancer and give them each different skill trees, or add some kind of spear-wielding mid-range class, or maybe some kind of assassin.\n\n-I'm not sure if it happens later on, but more loot that gives pets or active skills would be cool.\n\n\nI really love what you guys have done with this game so far.  Excellent work!\n\nOVERALL RATING: 9/10", "timestamp_created": 1504589533, "timestamp_updated": 1504616399, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510149", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34729970": {"recommendationid": "34729970", "author": {"steamid": "76561198331768432", "num_games_owned": 9, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 8069, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512262928}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u73a9\u4e86\u72c2\u6218\u58eb\u548c\u5723\u9a91\u58eb 2\u4e2a\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u76ee\u524d\u5df2\u7ecf\u5230600\u591a\u5c42\u3002\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u53ef\u73a9\u6027\u8fd8\u662f\u6bd4\u8f83\u5f3a\u7684\uff0c\u6280\u80fd\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u975e\u5e38\u591a\u5143\u5316\u3002\u7f8e\u4e2d\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u662f\u7f3a\u5c11\u591a\u4eba\u8054\u673a\u6a21\u5f0f\u548cBOSS\u8fc7\u4e8e\u5355\u8c03\u3002\u5e0c\u671b\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u7248\u672c\u66f4\u65b0\u6765\u70b9\u65b0\u9c9c\u82b1\u6837\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1504512830, "timestamp_updated": 1504512830, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34722440": {"recommendationid": "34722440", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028580519", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1913, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 16, "last_played": 1514289324}, "language": "english", "review": "Honestly I picked this up 3 days ago and already put 20 hours into it.\n\nIt's great.

I've put hundreds of hours into Diablo III, I've played TorchLight 2 through two times and I've dabbled around in Path of Exile.\n\nThis game is honestly my favorite of them all. I held off on it for the longest time due to how \"janky\" it looked in the trailers and it's true, even diving in and playing, the visuals are nothing amazing. \n\nBut the gameplay soon swept me up. It was slow in the beginning but I told myself, all ARPGs are slow in the start, because they are. Once my character got solidly rolling along, I was having alot of fun with it and I still am. I'm gonna be putting many, many, many hours into this game for absolute sure. I'll go ahead and wager 100+ at the minimum. \n\nThe high point of this game to me is the loot. Loot rains from the sky in this game, you find tons of items everywhere, and while leveling I was always finding not just *better* items but items that felt exciting and like major upgrades. This guy gets it. The CORE of this genre is finding exciting loot and atleast in my opinion, this game answers that call beautifully.\n\nI kept finding items that I'd stop and go:  \"Oh wow, look at this one.\"\n\nThat is what makes this game shine. \n\nThe controls are good. Again, the visuals are not that great, this includes many of the abilities but there is no doubt the abilities respond and fulfill their functions as expected. Over all, this game is in a very solid state, atleast in my experience.\n\nThe dev is also all over the forums, he's been engaging with this community, honest, forthcoming and responsive to his playerbase's concerns, questions and problems. He is clearly invested in working hard on this game. He is one of those devs that is demonstrating how you handle this gig. He is doing a brilliant job.\n\nThe only thing that may be a turn off for some people is the dev has done alot of thinking about it and confirmed there will be *NO* Multiplayer. He did not plan for it in the start and that it is beyond his skills at the moment and beyond his time table to go back and try to accomplish it now. He has said if there is a Chronicon 2 to follow, it will come with online multiplayer right from the start but that  this one will not have it. \n\nBeyond that, this is an absolutely great game once you look past it's graphics. You can't judge a book by it's cover, as they say, and this game is yet another reason you should never judge a game on it's initial looks.

Der Entwickler hat genau verstanden, worauf es bei einem Hack & Slay ankommt: Es muss krachen, die Gegner m\u00fcssen reihenweise fallen und dem Spieler fliegt Loot um die Ohren, bis es keinen Spa\u00df mehr macht. \n\nChronicon schafft es, dass ich mich recht schnell ziemlich m\u00e4chtig f\u00fchle und wenn ich dann aus den Latschen gehauen werde, weil ich nicht aufgepasst habe, dann ist das nicht die Schuld des Spiels, sondern meine eigene. Nun gut, an dieser Stelle w\u00fcrde ich mir w\u00fcnschen, dass es ein deutlicheres Feedback geben w\u00fcrde, wenn meine Gesundheit niedrig ist, denn der leicht flackernde Balken in der Ecke kann ganz schnell mal in Vergessenheit geraten, wenn der gesamte Bildschirm wackelt, Zahlen wie ein Heuschreckenschwarm durch die Gegend sausen und die Soundkulisse ein riesiges Trara veranstaltet, weil irgendwo auf der Map ein Epic gedroppt ist. (Ein Detail, das ich sehr sch\u00f6n finde.) Was nicht ist, kann ja noch werden, schlie\u00dflich ist das Spiel im Early Access.\n\nWer Handlung sucht, sollte besser an anderer Stelle weiter suchen, denn Chronicon wird f\u00fcr das bisschen Geschichte keine Preise gewinnen. Es ist im Akt-System ala Diablo aufgebaut und klaut sich Teile der Handlung aus anderen Spielen zusammen, aber who the hell cares? Als ob es bei H&S-Spielen um die Story gehen w\u00fcrde. Wenn ich ne gute Geschichte suche, spiele ich Baldurs Gate - hier braucht es nur einen Vorwand, um einige Zombies mit extremen Facelifting zu bearbeiten.\n\nDaf\u00fcr gef\u00e4llt mir der Sound ziemlich gut. Musik h\u00f6re ich bei all dem Gekrache und Geplatze nicht gro\u00dfartig, die ist zwar irgendwo, aber h\u00e4lt sich eher bedeckt. Ansonsten sind die Soundeffekte gro\u00dfartig gew\u00e4hlt und tragen bei der Entfaltung der Suchtwirkung ordentlich bei. Kristalle klimpern, Leder-/Ketten-/Platten-/Stoffr\u00fcstungen erzeugen beim Aufheben zufriedenstellende Ger\u00e4usche, Heiltr\u00e4nke blubbern, wie man es gewohnt ist ... da kann man sich recht schnell drin verlieren.\n\nZur Charakterentwicklung habe ich noch nichts gesagt, aber die ist auch nicht besonders komplex: Man steigt zweierlei Stufen auf: Charakter und Mastery. Mit jeder Stufe bekommt man einen Punkt f\u00fcr die jeweils zust\u00e4ndigen Skilltrees und fertig ist der Laden. Die Skilltrees erinnern mich ein wenig an World of Warcraft anno dazumal, es sind viele Prozentsachen, die den Schaden passiv erh\u00f6hen - Skills bekommt man gelegentlich, 5 oder 6 an der Zahl, bei denen man aus zwei oder drei Alternativen ausw\u00e4hlen kann. Komplexer wird die ganze Angelegenheit bei der Ausr\u00fcstung, denn da kann man Steine reinzimmern, Verzauberungen aufwerten oder sie \u00e4ndern, maximieren, optimieren, bis man das Item zur vollsten Zufriedenheit entwickelt hat, um es zwei Stufen sp\u00e4ter gegen ein anderes auszutauschen. \n\nInsgesamt muss ich sagen, dass mir Chronicon sehr, sehr gut gef\u00e4llt. Im ganzen Sud von Schrott, der hier auf Steam herumwabert, schwimmt diese kleine Perle an der Spitze und ich hoffe, dass noch viel mehr Leute dieses Spiel f\u00fcr sich entdecken, um dem Entwickler unter die Arme zu greifen.", "timestamp_created": 1499626904, "timestamp_updated": 1499626904, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33411136": {"recommendationid": "33411136", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069925659", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2736, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508154829}, "language": "german", "review": "Also das Spiel erfindet definitiv nicht das Rad neu aber absolut genial gemacht.

This game is everything and MORE that I wanted in it.  The music is beautiful and atmospheric, the loot has several tiers such as ordinary (white), Rare (Purple), Unique (Light Purple), Legendary (Red), and True Legendary (<Orange>).  The game is set up so that there are 4 classes - The Warden, Templar, Warlock, and Berserker.  Each of these classes has 4 different talent trees.  The max level is level 100, so that means 100 Talent points to spend any way you wish.  You can also respec at any time by buying a potion at the shop.  You also have Mastery Talents that level up as you level up.  Here is where it gets fun.  Mastery talents can go infinitely high.  This means that if you love to farm and grind that your character can power up infinitely.  Kind of like Diablo 3 they have included \"Anomolies\"  which are essentially Greater Rifts that level up each time you beat it.  This is not time based so you can go at your leisure.

I have high hopes for Chronicon however it's still very early in development. Given the current state of the game there is a lot of potential here, gameplay is solid however not enough content to keep me replaying the same areas again and again. \n\nI will be refunding and putting this back on my wishlist for further updates. It's still not quite up to par with other games I could be playing for the same price range. I'll be waiting till the next Summer sale. I've played enough to know that I'm not as entertained as I could be with this game. I would like to say it gives me nostalgia for mmorpgs such as ragnarok online and tibia, or a combination of the two, there is a tactical element to this game which I find appealing. Trying the game out first on veteran mode made me proceed carefully and not rush into trouble and I found trying out skills to be essential to the experience however the skill menu doesn't clearly indicate how the skills feel until you try them. Enemy ai and pathfinding could use a little work and making enemies more unique from each other. \n\nThis game is quickly falling behind newer games, some changes need to be made to keep it current.

I'll update this review after seeing progress into the development and putting some hours into it.\n\nPros:\n\n- Dialogue is actually well written which surprised me quite a bit. (made me want to read more story)\n- Skill options are varied, picking a class doesn't tunnel you into a specific build.\n- Skills scale based on points invested, always nice.\n\nCons:\n\n- UI is very unpolished, too small and not very intuitive.\n- Walls of text instead of text boxes instead of clickable text boxes.\n- Skills aren't very well explained, there should be an example of the skill animation.\n- No visual portraits or lack of, leaving too much to the imagination.\n- All character and enemy sprites could be improved.\n- Lack of online co-op to play with friends.", "timestamp_created": 1498366990, "timestamp_updated": 1498366990, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.319904", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "32755680": {"recommendationid": "32755680", "author": {"steamid": "76561198153193954", "num_games_owned": 644, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2170, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499305061}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u80fd\u52a0\u5165steam\u8054\u673a\u5c31\u597d\u4e86 Chinese plz", "timestamp_created": 1498365575, "timestamp_updated": 1498365575, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "32748857": {"recommendationid": "32748857", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065666250", "num_games_owned": 187, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2590, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500315916}, "language": "english", "review": "Addictive AF.", "timestamp_created": 1498349485, "timestamp_updated": 1498349485, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "32675241": {"recommendationid": "32675241", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079813611", "num_games_owned": 60, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1797, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500018753}, "language": "english", "review": "satisfying hack and slash indie game, definitely worth it", "timestamp_created": 1498214735, "timestamp_updated": 1498216176, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "32673665": {"recommendationid": "32673665", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058369550", "num_games_owned": 132, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 679, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500466266}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6539\u4e3a1080p\uff0c\u5f00\u542f\u5168\u5c4f\u540e\uff0c\u6e38\u620f\u9ed1\u5c4f\uff0c\u636e\u670b\u53cb\u544a\u77e5\uff0c\u6309alt+enter\u53ef\u7834\u3002ps:\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u5168\u5c4f\uff0c\u6539\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5373\u53ef\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1498211765, "timestamp_updated": 1498219256, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "32672493": {"recommendationid": "32672493", "author": {"steamid": "76561198208704116", "num_games_owned": 160, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1511, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502764021}, "language": "schinese", "review": "I need to finish Chinese", "timestamp_created": 1498209511, "timestamp_updated": 1498209511, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "32641418": {"recommendationid": "32641418", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077668717", "num_games_owned": 152, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3221, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510895762}, "language": "english", "review": "Very addicting action RPG.

The only thing you might dislike is the pixel graphics, but I recommend you give it a try anyway. This is the most fun I've had in an ARPG in a long long time.\n\nThe skill trees are dense, so even if there are 4 classes, they can all spec in 4 different ways, and skill resets are basically free (not sure if this will change later). Lots of customization options here.\n\nThe gameplay isn't super grindy, and loot is satisfyingly great. Lots of zones as well so you can farm a whole bunch of areas in one go. \n\nYou can also re-roll stats and upgrade/maximize stats on your drops, so you're not grinding hours and hours for the same drop to get perfect rolls. Enchanter is really a godsend. \n\nAnd of course, there are items that will tailor to your gameplay and spec (mostly based around what element and skill type you want to focus on), which gives you a reason to grind mobs end-game.\n\nOverall, this is a really fantastic game. Even though it's EA, it definitely feels polished and ready to launch.", "timestamp_created": 1498049782, "timestamp_updated": 1498049820, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.743370", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "32572387": {"recommendationid": "32572387", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025345269", "num_games_owned": 649, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 4187, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 26, "last_played": 1514127574}, "language": "english", "review": "For someone who habitually gets bored fast, Chronicon just doesnt ever get boring to me.

It feels like \"Grim dawn\" or \"Titan Quest\"'s  skill progression system. Yet with some extreme differences. Such as selecting which skill the pasives in its line buff. Such as the first skill slot gave me three choices for skills to put in that slot. Then that is buffed by a passive that is connected to it. Putting points into any skill in that pane increases that panes ?proficiency? skill. That gives passive buffs to the character, and also unlocka later skills in the pane.\n\nThe entire system is rather complex. The gameplay itself is rather basic. A 8 way isometric action rpg. Every enemy feels like a damage sponge. Anything above normal makes this much worse. As the enemies hp increases exponentially with the difficulty increase. The damage they do does as well, That is actually fun. If it didn't fell like it took  a hour to defeat any given enemy (exagerating, it liely on took a minute on the regular enemies and five on the champions on the highest difficulty. Still way to long).\n\nThe game is worth playing. It is different enough from anything else I have played to make it a interesting experience. I notice this is a early acess game. I will change my review to reflect what it is.

"num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1807, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490368905}, "language": "english", "review": "Chronicon is a pleasant surprise. For a long time, I have been searching for an ARPG to play, but none of those I tried succeeded at entertaining me. Until I found Chronicon. This game is DEFINITELY worth your attention.\n\nTLDR: ARPG done the right way, 9/10 (highly recommended)\n\nI finished all three available acts in approximately 18 hours. During this time I haven't been bored or annoyed for a single moment. The leveling is reasonably fast, but it will definitely get slowed down a bit when the game is finished. Within 20 hours, I got to level 85 (the cap is 100), while playing on Veteran difficulty. That made me really happy, because I detest having to farm the entire evening and getting like 3 levels out of it.\n\nThe fighting system can be described as a pure carnage. After I got over the slow start, got my set of skills and better gear, the bloodbath started. I played frost-fire warlock that specialized in corpse shattering and burning. Most of the time I would just run around, turning enemies into chain-exploding nuclear bombs. The challenge of getting rewarding high kill-streaks makes you play as stylishly and brutal as possible, ensuring a lot of fun in the process.\n\nThe skill system is remarkable. There are 4 skill trees for every class that you can combine as you please. Some skills are of course slightly imbalanced, but given the fact that the game is still in the early access, I expect them to be tweaked. You can also easily reset your skills and masteries with a cheap potion, so you can experiment with your builds. Neat!\n\nThe difficulty itself could use a bit of balancing as well. Most of the time I would just run around and blow everything up. Sometimes I even instantly blew up bosses. But there were a few bosses who would just instakill me a few times, even though I was doing my best at dodging and kiting. \n\nItems in this game are just great. There are tons of loot dropping constantly, so I would suggest smartly setting up your item filter for the Alt-key. This feature is handy and makes looting and sorting through stuff comfortable. Items of high rarity DO drop very often and moreover, all the legendary items (and maybe even unique, I don't remember) you find are available for your class. Amazing, isn't it?\n\nOn the other hand, I didn't find many uses for consumable items. As for the keys, I didn't have enough of them at the beginning, but now I have so much of them that it doesn't matter for me if the chests are locked anymore. Town portal scrolls are present basically just from the nostalgic obligation, as you easily gather more of them than you can use. I don't know what to think about these features, maybe they are a bit unnecessary. As for the buff potions, I didn't feel any need to use them, so I eventually stopped picking them up to save inventory space. I personaly think that consumable items could use a bit of developer's attention.\n\nThere is nothing much to tell about the story. I would say it's decent and it fits nicely with the game atmosphere. I don't care about the story in this type of game anyway, and usually skip story passages in additional playthroughs.\n\nMusic is nice and the \"voice acting\" made me giggle a few times. As for the art - I like the game visuals. It requires a bit of polishing here and there, but overall it's quite decent. I don't even mind the fact that the gear doesn't change the appearance of the character. What I would like to see though, is something that would make bosses look unique. Most of the bosses look like larger versions of regular mobs, which doesn't look that great. But then again, we are at the early access, so it may as well change in the future.\n\nTo sum up, the current state of the game offers a lot of entertainment. The developer is a nice person who updates fans with news regularly and swiftly comes to offer help to anyone in trouble. If he keeps up the good work, this game might become something very big. I wish him only the best and offer a big thumbs up, because he succeeded in something that even big companies regularly fail at - making a damn enjoyable game!\n\nFinal verdict: 9/10 (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED)\nDepending on the future state of full release, I may as well change the rating to 10/10 - yep, it's that good.", "timestamp_created": 1489773696, "timestamp_updated": 1489946284, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500083", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30563811": {"recommendationid": "30563811", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074718981", "num_games_owned": 51, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2013, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495710948}, "language": "english", "review": "Hi, Im loving this game but at the moment ever since i reformatted my harddrive it seems to have backdated my save file of almost 20 hours.

At around 30 hours I am spent and probably won't be playing much more of it. It's rare to find an ARPG I feel satisfied quitting, but this is one of them.

You can also respec at basically any time with an inexpensive potion.  \nI just finished Act 2 of 3 on Veteran difficulty and I haven't had to grind at all yet. That's a plus for me because it feels nicely balanced. I think in games like this, if you are putting a little thought into your levelling progression, you shouldn't need to grind until you get to the endgame stage.\n\nOverall the game feels really nice to play with a few minor hangups...\n\nI don't care for the art that much...I still play Diablo 2 and other pixel games so I'm not some big graphics snob; but I think the character models would be better served with smaller pixels and more detail. Right now things are kind of ugly. \n\nI also don't like that most of the bosses I've seen so far are just larger versions of normal mobs. This is especially unsettling because of the pixel problem I described above.\n\nI would also like to see some improvements to the mini map. I play Path of Exile and Diablo 2 with the minimap on almost all the time without problems but it just doesn't work as well in this game. It would be better if the map was smaller or relegated to a corner of the screen with a larger more detailed map being accessible through the menu or a hotkey. \n\nAll in all, this is a surprisingly good arpg, especially since it was made by ONE PERSON. That alone should get your money.

I will also add that playing the three classes of four there doesn't seem to be a healing class. If this game becomes super successful I can imagine a DLC or something to feel more immercive and team based. I believe the reason for the healer class being absent is that that's a hard job to do with leveling, as of course the game needs to function just as well in Single Player as well as Multiplayer.\n\nEvery class has 4-5 skill trees for maximum variety, mostly elemental variations of damage but the elements themselves are distinct from one another (cold tree is defensive and slows, fire tree burns stuff, etc.)\n\nWarlock is my most experienced character. Your warlock is every mage, ever. He can dedicate himself to one strong element/tree, or spread out for more variety - for example a hellfire glass cannon, or a Necromancer gathering minions from all the trees.\n\nThe added variation is from the second experience bar - separately you gain levels in Masteries, which are pure passives and they augment your play even more. The masteries are quite varied and  I daresay they are yet another skill tree with many considerations.\n\nThe Skills are fantastic, I think a healing class or more co-operative skills would have made this game perfect, but it's a small loss and considering that would be hard to do with a controller skills are a solid 9/10\n\nFinally there are the items - from common to unique you get your special things, even uniques roll random stats and you continue to find them at later levels - so your gear and drops are always around your level, but on the bright side it helps you better plan for the future. \n\nSome items are also sets, bonus possibilities are even greater there, but still nothing unexpected.\n\nThere's also enchantments but I haven't played that far into the game yet.\n\nLEGENDARY/Super Legendary(Lvl100+) Items - OOOOK here's the good stuff, these items start offering even weirder suffixes which apply directly to skills. You thought that passive looked cool, but the AoE explosion was too small? Well here comes a massive buff from these boots! Now it's a skill you can base your entire build around. Stuff like that.\n\nOverall the itemisation could have gone even more interestingly, but as of Early Access, I consider it a 8/10\n\n\nRandom facts: \n\nThere's no hardcore mode.\nThe game keeps you mashing buttons and it's entertaining but if that's not fun enough you have to hold out until you get several skills to really feel like your character is being fleshed out.\nMusic is 6/10 - decent but nothing special.\nArtwork 7/10\nGraphics, well it's only the first area and this is E.Access but it looks a little dull.

[/h1]\n\nI want to start by saying the BEST thing I have to say about this game for sure is the developer is extremely active in the community and very responsive, I was actually shocked to return to my suggestion post a day or two later and found the developer replied in roughly two hours!  Serious respect for the work this person is putting in!\n\nI got this game thinking, \"For $10 why not?  I could use a few hours of a new hack and slash action game.\"  But what I got was something so much more.  This game has a retro look and in some good ways a retro feel but it also has a lot of quality of life improvements that games like this have seen since the old Diablo 1 days and it also has some original and fun ideas too!\n\nI've only played a few of the classes so far and this is what I can say from what little I've played:\n\n[list][*]Templar is super easy mode for a while due to the massive life on hit you can get from the holy mastery, she just doesn't die.\n[*]Warden is a bit slow to get going but once you get a few companions rolling and work out some gear it's pretty awesome and fun.\n[*]Warlock I've barely played but it seemed to be pretty rough as you would expect from a \"mage\" class.\n[*]Berserker I haven't touched.[/list]\n\nThe biggest down side I can say about this game so far is no online multiplayer.  So if you want to play multi player expect to have someone sitting next to you and using a game pad.\n\nIn greater detail here's some features in the game I like:\n[list] [*]A good gambling system.\n[*]A [i]phenominal[/i] enchanting system for amazing customizability of items you obtain. \n[*]There are random portals that will open up to a \"dimentional pocket\" where all the enemies have a random enchantment added on them for extra fun/challenge. \n[*]There are \"Challenge scrolls\" that drop and once used open a portal to a challenge arena with strong monsters and a boss to finish it, very cool!\n[*]A great \"endless dungeon\" type feature after the story is cleared!\n[*]Multiple choice skills!  For example you can pick a lightning arrow or lightning magic orb for a basic attack early on. (warden class) And that's just one of the four skill trees!  Sometimes you can pick between three different abilities for one spot in the skill tree.  Another example would be in the lightning skill tree for the warden you can pick between (esentially) a group of melee, group of caster or single healer pet for the companion in that tree.  Awesome stuff![/list]\n\nThere's just so many things right here and very few things I personally consider to be coming up short and it's still in development so there's a lot of time to see improvements and good changes made and even without them it's a fantastic game as is!

I really wanted to hate it, I get a disturbing amount of joy out of disliking the indie craze that every dumb fan boy is jumping all over, but I can't.  This game really is killer for entertainment value.  I'll write a longer review when I get some time.\n\nSuffice it to say, I'm a pretty fickle person when it comes to graphics.  When i first started looking at this game, I was disgusted with the graphical style, but it grew on me.  It actually has a bit of charm.\n\nBalance seems to be a bit all over the place.  Both in terms of mobs and skills, but that's part of what makes the game fun.  I'm playing a lightning warden and this \"Nimbus\" Skill (a cloud that zooms around the map) is fantastic.  Cruises around, procs all my on attack effects, destroys the entire map.\n\nWhat surprised me the most is the pace and responsiveness of combat.  It's excellent.  I'm playing with WASD and my mouse and I've been extremely pleased with the control of my character.  I'll probably crack out the gamepad tomorrow just to see how it compares, but it absolutely can be played with M+KB.\n\nThere isn't a ton in the way of a story, but in an action RPG about the loot hunt and explosively awesome build combinations, that doesn't bother me.  It's there if you want it to be, but isn't particularly intrusive.  I think the single developer has plans to rewrite some the dialogue to improve the overall lore.  \n\nThe map overlay is a bit inconsistent as well.  In some areas, it's too dark (makes seeing your character/what's beneath the overlay difficult) and in others it is far too light.  This is pretty minor, but you might occassionally find yourself annoyed by it.  Note, there is a setting to change the opacity, but given the fast/frenetic gameplay it seems a bit obtuse to have to.  \n\nThe class system/build system is excellent.  Kind of similar to Grim Dawn/Titan Quest, though not exactly, and leaves you with a lot of options.  \n\nBoss encounters are designed pretty well; I enjoyed them, just wish there were more.\n\nDifficulty scaling could probably be tweaked.  I started in the middle, jumped to the second difficult around level 20, and by 50 I was playing on legendary after I had gotten some good gear.  I'm now level 100 and around ~60 anomaly and haven't had too many issues.  Occassionally run into a mob that has an absurd combination of affixes and wrecks me, but for the most part it is smoothe sailing.\n\nReally looking forward to the next couple of acts.

Amazing game.\n\nLet me start off by saying that me purchasing this game was sheer luck. I caught a streamer that I used to watch playing it and it immediately caught my attention and so I bought it... and boy am I glad that I did! My history with games alike? Well I play this genre quite 'religiously' you can say. I have played them since Diablo 2 first got me hooked to this genre. I have been through the Tochlight's, Grim Dawn, POE, D2-3, Titan Quest, Van Helsings and Victor Vran ect... you name it! And now we can add this gem to the list.\n\nWithout any sort of spoilers, I just wanted to create a little list instead of writing heaps of paragraphs.\n\nPRO'S:\n\n-This game pretty much has all that is good in arpg's alike and adds to that list, while leaving out the tedious/bad things. \n-The skill tree's are super CUSTOMIZABLE, have ultimate abilities and masterys! Oh, and respeccs aren't gated nor a pain in the butt like with some other games. \n-The combat is smooth as butter, something I was not expecting from game like this. \n-The loot and itemization is fun and engaging, and you are always excited to find that next upgrade. Furthermore, you will constantly find pieces that cater to other specific build types, so get ready to set pieces aside end game and tinker with them.\n-The content is still being updated obviously, but I can tell you that not ONCE was I bored or annoyed by the feel of and act. Other games tend to always have an act or 2 that are just dreadful, well not here!\n-The game offers  a lot of Ui customization. So that the user can play how he/she prefers.\n-The mobs are pretty engaging, all do different things and the areas are dense.\n-Endgame offers 'anomolies' aka endless dungeons, where they progressively get more difficult.\nalso... music is great, atmosphere is well done and the game has crafting.\n\nCons:\n-UGHH?... oh I guess no MP, but who can complain? It is a costly thing to implement.\n\nThere is so much more that I can say, but many others have covered quite a bit of this. I just wanted to further back those comments and this game in particular, because it is truly something special and I cannot wait to see what the future awaits. It is just a shame that only Inidie developers seem to have an ack in knowing how to make games great these days, in this case a super well done hack n slash arpg. This is probably why I have mostly given up on AAA titles.\n\n9/10 Highly Recommend.", "timestamp_created": 1483335899, "timestamp_updated": 1483335899, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.599468", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "28927506": {"recommendationid": "28927506", "author": {"steamid": "76561197962253568", "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2171, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488255747}, "language": "english", "review": "This game earns its price tag.

Like many other reviews, the comparison to oldschool Diablo is spot-on. Since its early days, a lot's been done to make the combat feel fluid and pleasant, and to add a little bit of variety to the game. On the upside, the game will shower you with loot and you'll never feel like you've been playing forever without changing some of your gear around, and there's never really a dull a moment in the game.\nOn the downside though, the animations are honestly servicable at best; they aren't /bad/ by any stretch, mind you, but they lack a little bit of fluidity. The game (as of the time of writing) does suffer from a little bit of jerkyness too; picking up currency often creates a really awkward stutter that's kind of hard to look past. Still, all of these things are minor gripes at best, and honestly very easy to look past.\nThe one thing that really brings the game down for me though, is just how completely overcrowded some of the earlier dungeons feel. Before level 10, you're reusing the same skill or two repeatedly to slowly cleave your way through enemies that are so cramped together, you barely get any time to go through your inventory to look at the loot you picked up.

There aren't many ARPG's like this with xinput support. Sure Grim Dawn has some \"meh\" controller support, but it never felt right, and made menu navigation feel tedious. Then I saw Chronicon.\n\nI had my doubts. I'm no graphics snob--it wasn't about the pixely style of the game. I'll take gameplay over visuals any day. It was mostly about this being such a little-known indie number. Loot/Grind/LevelUp/Repeat games are simple and addictive to play, but it's a beast to create a well balanced drip-feed of powerful items and rare enemies. Doing it right takes talent. There's no way this dinky little game was going to keep me interested for more than five minutes.\n\nI was wrong.\n\nFirst off, I've played waaaay more than the steam play record suggests. I've put considerable time in, basically since my GPD Win was first delivered. Chronicon has done more than surpass my expectations. It's one of those few examples of an early access game doing all the right things.\n\n-It's what was promised. It's playable, fun, and scratches the \"loot itch.\"\n-Great, clear communication from the developer on what he's working on, and what to expect next.\n-I actually find myself feeling excited for new content, rather than vaguely interested.\n-Much deeper than it seems. Those first few hours, I was convinced I'd seen the gist of what Chronicon had to offer. There are small puzzles leading to decent gear, procedurally generated \"events\" and other stuff to shake up the game a little and distract you in between grinding and inventory management. \"Yeah, okay, this IS a fun little game, but I don't know if I can play this forev--- OH, DEAR LORD, WHAT IS THAT?!

Y, para mi gusto, es el mejor de los de este tipo que he probado hasta el momento. De hecho, lo prefiero con mucho a los Diablos o a los otros clones (PoE, Grim Dawn, etc.) \nEstas son algunas de sus caracter\u00edsticas:\n\n-NO EXISTE MODO ONLINE. No es un juego multijugador masivo -aunque tiene un modo cooperativo para hasta 4 jugadores en el mismo ordenador. Esto, que parece un defecto, seguramente es lo que lo hace tan interesante para m\u00ed. Ahora veremos por qu\u00e9. \n-HAPPY FARMING! Al ser un juego offline, el juego permite farmear objetos con mucha m\u00e1s facilidad. Esto es l\u00f3gico porque al no existir la posibilidad de comerciar con otros jugadores -la parte para m\u00ed m\u00e1s odiosa de estos juegos- tu propio farmeo es el \u00fanico medio que vas a tener para obtener legendarios, sets. etc. As\u00ed que al final es todo menos aburrido: continuamente aparecen objetos interesantes. El tiempo que dedicas en otros juegos a trapichear con cacharros aqu\u00ed lo inviertes en matar bichos y probar c\u00f3mo funcionan tus nuevos objetos.\n-QUALITY OF LIFE. Otra parte desagradable de los MMORPGs es su aspecto terriblemente competitivo y el af\u00e1n que tienen los dise\u00f1adores por tenerte conectado a sus servidores meses y meses realizando tareas tediosas. Algunos ejemplos:\n -MORIR NO ES TAN GRAVE. En Chronicon, morir apenas causa penalizaci\u00f3n: pierdes un poco de experiencia y solo pierdes dinero si deseas hacer respawn donde has muerto. Esto \u00faltimo puede solucionarse como en Diablo 2, tomando la precauci\u00f3n de crear portales a la ciudad cuando preveas enfrentamientos peligrosos. As\u00ed que no tengas miedo, prueba estrategias nuevas, combinaciones distintas de objetos, zonas aparentemente por encima de tu nivel, etc. Lo peor que puede pasar es que te maten y en Chronicon eso es poca cosa.\n -JUEGA CON LOS SKILLS SIN MIEDO. \u00bfCu\u00e1ntas veces has empezado una build y tras 50 horas dedicadas a ella descubres que no es viable porque has derrochado 5 puntos en una habilidad que no serv\u00eda para nada? En juegos como PoE esto es especialmente grave: intentar crear tu propia build en PoE equivale a ser vapuleado tras los primeros 20 \u00f3 30 niveles: no hay m\u00e1s remedio que consultar gu\u00edas. Por contra, en Chronicon, basta con comprar una poci\u00f3n muy barata para poder volver a recolocar los puntos como te d\u00e9 la gana las veces que quieras. Ya no es necesario empezar un nuevo personaje 5 veves para encontrar la build que te gusta. Y no solo puedes ir probando hasta encontrar tu preferida: puedes usar builds espec\u00edficas para enemigos o zonas espec\u00edficas, o para objetos o sets de objetos espec\u00edficos. P. ej: si obtienes un set que duplica el da\u00f1o de fuego, puedes rentabilizar tu hallazgo elegiendo una build basada en el da\u00f1o de fuego. \n -HAPPY FARMING + RESPEC = ENJOY! \u00c9ste \u00faltimo es el otro gran motivo por el que farmear en Chronicon no es una tarea est\u00fapida y compulsiva: apretar un bot\u00f3n cien mil veces hasta que salga justo el cacharro que necesitas. Cuando aparece un legendario fant\u00e1stico pero que no se adapta a tu build ya no tienes que desperdiciarlo vendi\u00e9ndolo: lo puedes probar y disfrutar cambiando totalmente la rutina de tu estilo de juego.\n-SE ACEPTAN SUGERENCIAS. En efecto: otra cosa que me resulta odiosa de los MMORPGs es cuando aparecen los diosecillos anunciando que van a nerfear no s\u00e9 qu\u00e9 habilidad de los nigromantes o meten un parche que se carga algo que a los jugadores les encantaba y entonces un mill\u00f3n de frikis se disgustan un mont\u00f3n y queman los foros y se l\u00edan a tortas con los fanboys hasta que los dioses, a trav\u00e9s de un plasma que, al contrario que sus servidores no tiene lag, declaran que la plebe no entiende nada de sus geniales ideas. Chronicon lo ha programado un solo tipo y \u00e9l mismo pregunta a sus jugadores qu\u00e9 creen que se podr\u00eda a\u00f1adir o quitar. Se dir\u00e1 que eso del buen rollito pasa con todos los juegos indie. Bueno, no con todos \u00bfeh? Mirad \"No man\u00b4s sky...\" \n-LIGERO Y BONITO. Cada d\u00eda aborrezco m\u00e1s los juegos que ocupan ochocientos mil gigas y que petan el ordenador de gr\u00e1ficos ultra HD hechos en serie y sin el menor talento art\u00edstico. No necesito esa enorme y pesad\u00edsima mierda de dinaosaurio en mi disco duro. Chronicon emplea solo 200 mb en divertirme diez veces m\u00e1s de lo que lo hacen PoE o Diablo 3 con 10 gigas.  \n-Y ESTO NO ES TODO AMIGOS. Porque cuando escribo esto el juego est\u00e1 en Early Access y con muchas cosas que a\u00f1adir: nuevos actos y un prometedor sistema en el que ser\u00e1 posible adjudicar un n\u00famero de puntos ilimitado a determinados skills. \u00bfOs imagin\u00e1is? \"S\u00ed, tengo un warlock de nivel 235.560.442...\" \n\nNo he hablado de cosas elementales del juego como que de momento tiene 4 clases jugables, cada una de ellas con cuatro \u00e1rboles de habilidades, 200 habilidades en total, m\u00e1s de 500 objetos y que t\u00e9cnicamente es muy s\u00f3lido: jam\u00e1s he tenido un cuelgue o el m\u00e1s m\u00ednimo problema (y repito que es una Early Access.)\n\nEn resumen si te gusta jugar a juegos como Diablo pero sin los inconvenientes (y para algunos ventajas) del turbio, hipercompetitivo y aburrido mundo online masivo, tienes que comprar Chronicon. \nSon 10 euros...", "timestamp_created": 1472313774, "timestamp_updated": 1472314362, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8,

Plenty of content to keep you busy, this game is in beta, so its only going to get better.\n\nThanks", "timestamp_created": 1471892084, "timestamp_updated": 1471892084, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495146", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "24989802": {"recommendationid": "24989802", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051305640", "num_games_owned": 59, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 426, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512086101}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u043a\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0441\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430, \u0432\u0441\u0435\u043c \u043b\u044e\u0431\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044f\u043c \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u0436\u0430\u043d\u0440\u043e\u0432 \u0441\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0443\u044e!", "timestamp_created": 1471515306, "timestamp_updated": 1471515306, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "24984282": {"recommendationid": "24984282", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077070658", "num_games_owned": 125, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 468, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483132240}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "The game is good, pretty good.\nYou probably will spend a lot of time playing.\nUnfortunatelly, the game is still in early access and it doesn't have any prediction to get finished.\n\nO jogo \u00e9 pra car@leo.\nCompra, sem arrependimento.\nO f0d4 \u00e9 que ta no acesso atencipado e sem previs\u00e3o de ser lan\u00e7ado.", "timestamp_created": 1471483751, "timestamp_updated": 1471483751, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.538462", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "24970854": {"recommendationid": "24970854", "author": {"steamid": "76561198281883584", "num_games_owned": 69, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 492, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504438739}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u53ea\u60f3\u8bf4\u600e\u4e48\u8fd8\u6ca1\u6709\u6c49\u5316\u3001\u3001", "timestamp_created": 1471429337, "timestamp_updated": 1471429337, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.566929", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "24935004": {"recommendationid": "24935004", "author": {"steamid": "76561198241943682", "num_games_owned": 9, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 3246, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508063093}, "language": "thai", "review": "\u0e2a\u0e19\u0e38\u0e01\u0e21\u0e32\u0e01\u0e04\u0e38\u0e49\u0e21\u0e01\u0e31\u0e1a\u0e40\u0e07\u0e34\u0e19\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e40\u0e2a\u0e35\u0e22\u0e44\u0e1b\u0e1e\u0e31\u0e12\u0e19\u0e32\u0e15\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e44\u0e1b\u0e19\u0e48\u0e30\u0e04\u0e23\u0e31\u0e1a ^^", "timestamp_created": 1471271550, "timestamp_updated": 1471271550, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "24920432": {"recommendationid": "24920432", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012338360", "num_games_owned": 268, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 1393, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501641524}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty damn fun, I'll be happy if games like these keep coming out.\n\nUpdate:\n\nMany updates have been given since I posted this, and the game is even better than it was. \nLoot crazy game, and really addicting. \n\nStill glad I purchased.", "timestamp_created": 1471208782, "timestamp_updated": 1484623514, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498127", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "24844172": {"recommendationid": "24844172", "author": {"steamid": "76561198096363930", "num_games_owned": 58, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 5236, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510522001}, "language": "english", "review": "In short, this game is a true gem and I recommend it for any one looking for a hack'n'slash loot fest, a Diablo with a more arcade-like feel to it.

So there is really not a lot of needless running around.\n\nI have not played with friends, but I imagine it would be just as fun as any other aRPG is with friends.\n\nAll highlight points aside, if you are looking for a pixel art aRPG similar to Diablo, then just buy this right now, it is completely worth the full price, and if you see it on sale there should be no question at all.\nIt is so satisfying on so many levels it is hard to put into words.", "timestamp_created": 1466557829, "timestamp_updated": 1466557829, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507249", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23686530": {"recommendationid": "23686530", "author": {"steamid": "76561198203388109", "num_games_owned": 138, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 5624, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506159423}, "language": "schinese", "review": "2016.6.21\u2014\u2014\u7eaa\u5ff5\u5168\u6210\u5c31\u6492\u82b1\n\n\u7531\u4e8e\u7f51\u7edc\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6e38\u620f\u65f6\u957f\u4e0e\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e0d\u7b26\uff0c\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u670980\u5c0f\u65f6\u5de6\u53f3\u3002\n\n+\u50cf\u7d20\u98ce\u683cARPG\uff0c\u5237\u5237\u5237\n+\u88c5\u5907\u4e30\u5bcc\uff0c\u7206\u7387\u611f\u4eba[spoiler]\u5c60\u9f99\u5b9d\u5200\uff0c\u70b9\u51fb\u5c31\u9001[/spoiler]\n+\u81ea\u7531\u9009\u62e9\u96be\u5ea6\uff0c\u9ad8\u96be\u5ea6\u9ad8\u7ecf\u9a8c\u9ad8\u7206\u7387\n+\u8fde\u5c60\u6709\u7ecf\u9a8c\u548c\u91d1\u94b1\u5956\u52b1\n+\u51e0\u7387\u89e6\u53d1\u7684\u76f8\u4f4d\u5730\u56fe\n+\u96be\u5ea6\u4e0d\u65ad\u63d0\u5347\u7684\u65e0\u5c3d\u6a21\u5f0f\n+\u4f5c\u8005\u66f4\u65b0\u9891\u7e41\uff0c\u8ba4\u771f\u8d1f\u8d23\n+\u591a\u79cd\u804c\u4e1a\u5929\u8d4b\u3001\u6280\u80fd\u6811\uff0c\u81ea\u7531\u6d17\u70b9\u8fdb\u884cbuild\n[spoiler]+\u6cd5\u7237\u5f88\u5f3a[/spoiler]\n-\u76ee\u524d\u8fd8\u6ca1\u6709\u4e2d\u6587\uff08\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0d\u5927\uff09\n-\u53ea\u652f\u6301\u672c\u5730\u53cc\u4eba\uff0c\u4e0d\u80fd\u8054\u673a\n-\u6e38\u620f\u5730\u56fe\u8f83\u906e\u6321\u753b\u9762\n-\u4e3b\u7ebf\u6d41\u7a0b\u77ed\uff08\u672a\u5236\u4f5c\u5b8c\u6210\uff09\n[spoiler]-\u6cd5\u7237\u592a\u5f3a\u4e86[/spoiler]\n8.8/10\u5206\n\n\u7ecf\u5178\u7684\u5237\u5237\u5237\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u662f\u50cf\u7d20\u98ce\u4f46\u53ef\u73a9\u6027\u4e0d\u4e9a\u4e8e\u6697\u9ed1\u7834\u574f\u795e\u7cfb\u5217\u7684\u795e\u4f5c\uff0c\u4f55\u51b5\u8fd8\u5904\u5728\u4e0d\u65ad\u66f4\u65b0\u7684EarlyAccess\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u5168\u4ef7\u4e70\u6765\u5237\u5237\u5237\u4f9d\u65e7\u4e0d\u4e8f\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u505a\u5168\u6210\u5c31[spoiler]\u6210\u5c31\u515a\u4e00\u672c\u6ee1\u8db3[/spoiler]\n\n\u518d\u7a0d\u5fae\u63d0\u51e0\u4e2a\u4e0d\u8db3\uff1a\n1.\u5806\u9ad8\u51b7\u5374\u7f29\u51cf\u53ef\u4ee5\u65e0\u654c = = \u8fd9\u4e2a\u5c5e\u6027\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\n2.\u6ca1\u6709\u65bd\u6cd5\u901f\u5ea6\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u8ddf\u653b\u901f\u6df7\u5728\u4e86\u4e00\u8d77\n3.\u6bcf\u4e2a\u804c\u4e1a\u4e0d\u540cbuild\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u51b0\u6cd5\u3001\u8346\u68d8\u6218\u7b49build\u592a\u8fc7\u65e0\u8111[spoiler]\u8be5\u524a[/spoiler]\n4.\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u6a59\u88c5\u89c2\u8d4f\u6027\u5927\u4e8e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u6700\u540e\u53ea\u80fd\u6ca6\u4e3a\u6536\u85cf\u3002\u3002\n\n\u603b\u4e4b\u8fd8\u662f\u597d\u6e38\u620f\u55662333\u5750\u7b49\u4f5c\u8005\u66f4\u65b0(\u0e07 \u2022\u0300_\u2022\u0301)\u0e07", "timestamp_created": 1466519675, "timestamp_updated": 1466519824, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "4.928221", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23619184": {"recommendationid": "23619184", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038453129", "num_games_owned": 58, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3298, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1514327635}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game, it offers a lot more than I thought it could.

The art style while definitely unique, it kinda feels a bit too simplistic for my taste but that doesn't take away from the fun. There's 3 Acts completed by the time of this review and the developer updates quite frequently with content and general fixes, there's 2 more acts in the works from what it seems which is quite exciting!\n\nThe combat might feel stiff at times but there's nothing too serious to hinder the player. There's lots of dungeons to explore, quests and optional quests, a quite decent story to unravel and the gear system is top notch. Legendaries, sets, you name it. There are several classes to choose from, each one with own specific talent tree and an important note is that you can actually change your talents at your leisure for dirt cheap.\n\nThere's some endgame content in the form of Anomalies (think of Diablo III rifts) and quite a few secrets within the main campaign.\n\nOverall this is a very promising game, sort of like a diamond in the rough, quite worth its price compared to the hours of content provided, and there's replayability with playing different classes and doing anomalies. The game also supports local co-op however I did not had the chance to give it a go.\n\nRecommended for experienced ARPG fans and even more so for those who might be new to genre.", "timestamp_created": 1464536218, "timestamp_updated": 1464536289, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.593574", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23257839": {"recommendationid": "23257839", "author": {"steamid": "76561198107050519", "num_games_owned": 188, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 2808, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501799412}, "language": "polish", "review": "Gr\u0119 kupi\u0142em wczoraj, a dzisiaj mam ju\u017c przegrane 23h i 50 lvl :D\n\nJedna z fajniejszych gier w jakie mia\u0142em okazj\u0119 pogra\u0107, a troch\u0119 ich by\u0142o ;)", "timestamp_created": 1464460051, "timestamp_updated": 1464460051, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502157", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23176625": {"recommendationid": "23176625", "author": {"steamid": "76561198296870647", "num_games_owned": 30, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 4183, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510987047}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4e00\u5468\u76ee\u73a9\u4e86\u6cd5\u5e08-\u3002-\u5237\u88c5\u5907\u4ec0\u4e48\u7684\u8fd8\u662f\u633a\u6709\u610f\u601d\u7684  \u5e0c\u671b\u65e9\u65e5\u80fd\u628a\u540e\u9762\u7684\u7ae0\u8282\u51fa\u5168\u5427", "timestamp_created": 1464068359, "timestamp_updated": 1464068359, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23160314": {"recommendationid": "23160314", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076826218", "num_games_owned": 65, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2495, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511153526}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a nice rpg.\nI've been playing since I bought and it's a good rpg to play.\nIf you like Diablo 1 and 2, you'll like it.

Finding new items felt good.. But one of the biggest draws to this genre for me personally is the cosmetic side of things.

I was disappointed to see that in Chronicon as soon as i started equipping things my character didnt change at all. Im fine with gender locked/base type characters in games like this, but having zero gear customization at all really kills any fun I had with it. I refunded the game for now, but hope maybe they are planning to add more customization once they have the core fundamentals of the game nailed down first.

first review on Steam.\n\nIf you like Diablo 2 you will feel right at home with Chronicon. \nSeriously, this game only gets better the more you play and the developer (yes, this is a ONE person made game) spews out updates like there\u2019s no tomorrow. It\u00b4s a Hacknslash ARGP with tons of loot and randomization.\nAct 3 is being worked on & A4 + A5 are coming. Even in this early state the game is amazingly fun. \nFour classes might sound little but each has 4 different build trees, There are 100 levels available and more classes will eventually get released once the game goes live.\nThis is the story of how a 1-person indie developer can do better games than multimillion dollar companies. It\u00b4s David vs. Goliath and it\u00b4s all about passion. The itemzation alone is better than anything I\u2019ve seen since D2. Yes, it\u00b4s not that pretty and yes it is old school 8-bit graphics - if Virtual Eye Candy is a must look elsewhere. For those who can accept lesser graphics for better game quality think Gauntlet meets Diablo 2 and immensely addictive. \nEven the pricing is ridiculously low. 10 bucks? I threw more than double the price amount on donations alone just to get this going.\n\n\nCons \nThe build trees themselves could use more diversity\nNo online play \n8 bit graphics\nNeeds more advertisement (WAKE UP Total Biscuit, Angry Joe, ReformistTM, Quill18 and all the others)\n\nPros\nOld school ARGP at its finest\nThe developer clearly shows a lot of passion and it easy to get smitten\nKeyboard or gamepad - your choice\nUp to 4 Players on one machine with gamepads\nRandom maps\nQuests\n100 Class and skill point levels\nFive difficulties (you choose difficulty each new session)\nNo-return portals with random zone affixes\nCheap Skill-reset potions \nLegendary loot can drop from the get go\nShrines that yield buffs\nRiddles yielding extra loot when solved\n10 bucks\nTons of customization in the options menu\n10 bucks\n4 Trees with overlapping mechanics for each class\n10 bucks\nChampions & Bosses with random affixes\nDid I mention it only costs 10 bucks?",

I love the loot pops, and the color coding and the whole hamster wheel. This game takes a lot of elements wholesale from diablo games. And it's often better off for it. I was shocked that a game that looked like this could literally be such a worthy contender in the genre.\n\nUnfrotunately, I would rank this below such games as grim dawn, diablo 2, diablo 3, and even sacred 2. Some things about this game, despite having a ABSOLUTE TON of great content, are asthetic. The art style frustrates me. The sound effects lack any kind of crunch or grit. They all fall completely flat. And hitting enemies results in no explosion of bones or gibs or anything. It's just a sprite change from alive to dead. \n\nA game like this needs crunchy impact. And right now , if i start a new game with a magic caster. Every single attack sound will irritate me. I could literally open up a free sound deposit website and find something better than the default attack sound. The visuals also lack that same gravity, they don't have to be 3d or gothic. If you want to use 2d lowbit sprites go ahead, just make them attractive.\n\nFinally, the game itself has a lot of systems. And most of them, including combos, enchanting, skill trees, and loot stats are all quite good. The loot drop rate however is far too high. You go strait out the first gate in the game and it's nothing but blues. I think that needs to be inverted. Completely reverse the drop rate. And make a colored item, you know, rare. Make whites mostly drop. \n\nNow, in order for this to work, you need to make the core combat without stats be crunchy. The entire reason why I think you have stats right away is because the raw combat never feels crunchy or satisfying. Make the core combat have crunch, sound plays a big role.

However, I give it my recommendation because of this, and in spite of it's various flaws.\n\nThe skill system could use some work. A lot of it is cookie-cutter. Main Skill + Mana Reducing effect. I am not exageratting when I say every class follows this path, so the early hours of the game are mainly spamming a single skill. And why do I need to dump 10 skill points into that skill for it be usable? I should be spending those points on getting new abilities which will vary the game play.\n\nThe combat, outside of character building, is simple, but satisfying. Screen shakes, enemies explode all over the place, kill chains keep you moving (would love the timer bar from D3 in there!). That's all good stuff.\n\nThe itemization is also fairly solid, with some neat items to find, and while nothing mind blowing or game changing, there is a certain level of character customization to be found in what gear you decide to wear. Healing vs. Damage vs. Utility. \n\nI give it a tentative recommendation. I will probably keep an eye out and keep playing, but hopefully over time, the skill system could get a closer look to enable more varied combat between classes and skill trees.\n\nThere is some stiff competition in terms of ARPGs these days, and even a tiny indie project must consider that, because you're fighting for that time. I would like to see this game do things a little differently, offer something fresh, as opposed to the same things found in AAA ARPGs, but at a smaller and pixelated scale.\n\n6/10 Not terrible.", "timestamp_created": 1452532070, "timestamp_updated": 1452532177, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "20410918": {"recommendationid": "20410918", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000257943", "num_games_owned": 352, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 485, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1454290949}, "language": "english", "review": "This game brought back memories of diablo 2.

dungeons, lots of loot, and 4 distinct classes. Slightly clunky, but very well-developed for an early access title.\n\nFor maximum enjoyment: use a controller, turn up the ambient light in the settings, find a big screen, and invite three friends with three more controllers.\n\nEdit: Having now played Chronicon for over 60 hours and reached level cap, I thought it worthwhile to expand this review.\n\nChronicon is easily one of the best Early Access titles I've played. The game is well balanced, the classes are already fleshed-out (with 4 skills trees each and plenty of legendaries to enhance each tree), and the level design is random enough that there's always an element of uncertainty (although the very small maps tend to just juggle around enemy variety and placement). The game has pretty solid controller support for both XBox 360 and Steam Controller; I mostly play with the latter.\n\nThe local co-op is one of Chronicon's strongest features. I've played a few hours with my brother and my girlfriend and it's a really enjoyable and straighforward experience. Just plug in another controller and go. Be prepared to spend a fair bit of downtown sorting through loot, though.\n\nThe updates have been very regular and significant so far. I worry about the amount of sleep the dev is getting. Bug fixes come very quickly and I haven't yet encountered a bug that ruined the game or cost me significant progress.\n\nThe plot isn't particularly rivetting, but I've never played an ARPG with an even remotely engaging plot, so this doesn't bother me. We're all here to kill monsters, after all, not read walls of text. And Chronicon's monster-slaying is highly satisfying. This is a game where you butcher hundreds of enemies in one go. The game includes a killstreak mechanic similar to D3's, except in Chronicon you'll quickly find yourself bringing in killstreaks that break 100. On higher levels, you'll find yourself getting closer to 1000.\n\nI highly recommend Chronicon, especially if you're a fan of loot-heavy, dungeon crawling action rpgs but miss the controller support of older console titles like Dark Alliance and Champions of Norrath.", "timestamp_created": 1450560834, "timestamp_updated": 1452796511, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543593", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "19782706": {"recommendationid": "19782706", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961495039", "num_games_owned": 139, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2296, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1464866174}, "language": "schinese", "review": " \u771f\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e0d\u9519\u7684\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u6709\u70b9\u6697\u9ed1\u7684\u611f\u89c9\uff0c\u6389\u843d\u7684\u7269\u54c1\u4e5f\u5f88\u591a\u3002\u5f88\u9002\u5408\u6211\u8fd9\u79cd\u6697\u9ed1\u8ff7", "timestamp_created": 1450535337, "timestamp_updated": 1450535337, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "19762082": {"recommendationid": "19762082", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040884867", "num_games_owned": 1255, "num_reviews": 650, "playtime_forever": 292, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1450519327}, "language": "english", "review": "[b][i]Chronicon[/i] is essentially an indie version of [i]Diablo[/i], and I really like it.[/b] You can play up to four players local (no online), which really spices things up with a game like this.

I dont expect anybody to take my word for it but this game is a shinning star in a barren sky....you know what caught my eye???? The screenshot of the inventory space :-)  That always gets me.......its a good buy and the price is right if you like dungeon crawlers......oh...and the dev is AWESOME!!!!!!!.....he REALLY cares!!!!! Really!!!!....dont believe me???..ask a question in the forums!!!!...or even make an interesting observation....he'll hit you up....and the updates are pretty fast...somebody noted a bug and it was fixed the next day....guy is awesome man...and so is the game.  :)", "timestamp_created": 1438730431, "timestamp_updated": 1438730431, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515735", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "17370572": {"recommendationid": "17370572", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031292793", "num_games_owned": 740, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2571, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496195172}, "language": "english", "review": "Well there isn't really much else to say that the other reviews haven't already said, but I will say that the game is very good. It's well made, with very good gameplay mechanics and surprisingly a lot to do. There isn't as much content as I would like, as of writing this review there is currently only 1 act available. However, don't let that fool you as there is a lot of content packed into the act, plus there are something like 5 different difficulties to choose from (though they dont really change things much). \n\nThe maps are giant, to do a full clear of a map will likely take at least an hour if not more to complete. There are tons of enemies and various enemy modifiers that can make enemies different, like speed modifiers and element modifiers. There are secret rooms packed with treasures, there are tons of items to find, with lots of various stats. There are currently 4 classes (a paladin (template), warrior (beserker), hunter (warden), mage (warlock)). Each class has 3 skill paths, 2 paths for active skills and 1 path for passive skills. Each class can have a total of 3 active skills at once, with the ability to reset your skills from a potion within town. Each skill can be upgraded a total of 10 times. There are pets and minions as well.\n\nAs it stands the game is really good, I can't wait for more content and updates. Something else worth noting is that the developer is very involved, posting and helping in the forums to every question asked so far.

Slower than Nuclear Throne, but faster than Enter the Gungeon.\n\nThe graphics really capture the feeling of NES games in ways that most pixel-y games don't. The limited colors and the way that they animate are dead-on. And, it has the great sense of absurdity of that era of shmups. Enemies are somewhat abstract, and can be anything from ghosts to wizards running around a vague post-apocalyptic facility of some sort.\n\nThe weapon system is interesting. There are seven basic weapon types you can pick up, and they come with 2-4 modifiers that change how they work in some way. Like a fireball weapon that instead shoots a shotgun blast of smaller fireballs. Or a laser that fires bullets off from the side of the beam. There aren't really any BAD modifiers, so it never feels like you're getting screwed by the RNG.\n\nThis game has a permanent upgrade system, allowing you unlock some weapons and upgrades and add them to the pool. BUT, critically, it also allows you to TURN OFF these upgrades and take them out of the random pool, if you find you don't like them. For example, there's a sword weapon you can unlock, and I didn't like how it worked, so I just went back to the shop and turned it off. Boom, no more swords! I really wish more games would do this.\n\nOverall it's just a fantastic little game.

They often riff too much off nuclear throne, or steal a bit too much from isaac, or just fall under the category of \"X but a rougelike\".\n\nThis is not one of those games. Monolith is bursting with creativity, innovation, and style. \n\nThe moment to moment gameplay is damn fun; a bullet hell twin stick shooter may sound tired, but this is made by Fraxy veterans. they know what they're doing. The long term strategy is fun also, balancing the ideas of making players feel more powerful and keeping it balanced so any run is still salvageable (notice that your damage never really goes that far up in most runs). The bosses and enemies are excellently crafted, dishing out bullets in such fun ways it never gets boring to weave and bomb through em.\n\nAnything the gameplay does, the artistic side does one better. The graphics are masterfully made, balancing readability and quality. The visual design on enemies is superbly creative, throwing ghosts, mages, and robots at you and still having it all work. The music is excellently chippy; you'll find at least one song you want to listen to on loop. This all blends together to create a perfect world, dark but cheerful.\n\nDo note that this is not a perfect game: It doesn't have the most variety out of all rougelikes, so you may find the runs start to be a little same (this wont happen for quite some time though: while each run may feel the same, the moment to moment stuff tends to have quite a nice slice of activity). There are also some massive difficulty spikes and imbalances, especially in several of the bosses (lookin at you, firewall). These issues, however, don't pull down the experience.\n\nIf you like the genre, this is a must get.

Monolith takes the core gameplay of titles like Binding of Isaac and improves it in almost every respect. It's better paced, more tightly controlled, and strikes the perfect balance between making you feel overpowered and underpowered based on the upgrades you get.\n\nPerhaps my favourite aspect of Monolith is the way it combines different weapon affixes by default. Remember how in Binding of Isaac certain combinations of items were crazy fun, but you only got them together once in a blue moon? Well Monolith does that right off the bat. You'll never just get a boring default laser or fireball weapon, they always have some wacky property like multishot, ricochet, or chain damage attached.\n\nBosses, enemies, and room layouts are fun and varied, the tone is equal parts cute and exciting, and the gameplay is just sublime. If you've ever enjoyed roguelites like Binding of Isaac, Enter the Gungeon, or bullet hell shooters in general, then you NEED to play Monolith.

With a simple story but great gameplay, this is a very easy to pick up game but hard to master.\n\nThe control is simple, you use your mouse to aim where you shoot, m1 to shoot, m2 to dash/dodge, then use WASD to move circling the crosshair. Not just that, you'll notice while circling around, the ship will do a barrel roll move, in which the hitbox will follow the shape. Yes, the hitbox will become narrow while you do that, so you can maneuver a dodge in between a tight bullets, so the game emphasis more on dodging bullet while also aiming your shot. Although, you can use a bomb with the left shift button if you feel overwhelmed by the bullets the enemies spew to you.\n\nAside from the interesting take on shmup, you won't just progress in a straight path like in most shmup. You will traverse through a randomly generated map to break the seal of the door in the current level to progress to the next level after defeating a random boss, although the theme of each level is fixed.\n\nAll in all, if you like the shmup or/and bullet hell genre, this is a great game to pick up. Not really into those genre but wanted to try it? Well you can't go wrong with buying this game. For a cheap price of $5, you'll find it worth more than that. \n\nIf you can, get it full price, that's great, or if you don't know what to get in a sale, I can safely say this is a hidden gem that you won't regret buying.", "timestamp_created": 1513093355, "timestamp_updated": 1513093355, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38244165": {"recommendationid": "38244165", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022598324", "num_games_owned": 700, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1007, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 35, "last_played": 1513321673}, "language": "english", "review": "Similar mechanically to binding of isaac, but without all the bloat and RNG.

Everyone should know about this game.\n\nMonolith is a twin-stick shooter with rogue-lite elements. It has permadeth, randomly generated floor layouts and weapon spawns, a small amount of game-to-game persistance brought to you via your cute cat-blob friend, and many other staples of the genre. This game checks off all of the boxes. However, it is far from formulaic. Despite the pixle graphics and dytopic, magic-punk setting, the game oozes personality and--I was pleasently surprised to find--real charm. Not only that, but the difficulty of the game is perfect, especially when paired with the flawless controls. Other than some frustratingly difficult to use weapons (I'm looking at you, Sword) and some runs being still-born due to bad RNG, this game is just about perfect.\n\nI also want to point out the awesome music. It's great, perfectly paired with the environments and bosses, and sticks in your head long after a session.\n\nI should probably metion that The Binding of Isaac is one of my favorite games of all time. I even bought a physical copy of the original game hand packaged and signed by McMillan and his wife. I also love shmups. This little game is the most perfect marriage of those two things I have ever encountered. The controls are so tight they make Enter the Gungeon and Isaac feel frustratingly loose. The gameplay loop and boss design make Nuclear Throne seem boring by comparison.

Enemies are varied, have decent AI, and are fun to fight. You generally feel much more powerful than the enemies, but over time the game's difficulty slowly increases (number of enemies, bullet patterns etc).  Bosses are quick but still fun. the pixel art looks fantastic.\n\nI can understand the map, I don't get lost, and always feel like I'm making progress and having fun shooting down enemies.

Enter the Gungeon was on its way, but it was, in my opinion, too slow, uneven and indecisive. Monolith lets you move as fast as your reflexes allows you. Rooms evoke Gradius, R-Type and other obstacle-based shmups while the bosses are (for the most part) from the bullet hell stable. The base weapon being relatively powerful and the room design being good enough means that you'll never get unavoidably hit. You WILL get hit a lot, but usually you'll realize how you could've dodged afterwards at least :D\n\nWith very few exceptions the weapons you can pick up all feel powerful. Rather than being static they have random keywords that might for example slow enemies or make the shot wrap around the screen. Since weapons are powerful and self-contained you don't run into the Isaac-scenario where you're frustrated by not having enough damage output.\n\nProgression is also really good. Normal mode is fast and fun, but still fair for beginners. Hard Mode is not higher numbers, it's harder configurations of enemies, trickier patterns and boss redesigns. The bosses are all good too! I can't think of a single bad one (though some of Overlord's patterns are a bit cheap). As you make progress you unlock new weapons and weapon code words you can buy. The game even lets you toggle them off again if you find they hinder more than help (by making base weapons/keywords come up more rarely that is).\n\nI really hope more gets added to it; more enemies, bosses, room designs.

There's all kinds of S-rank runs and self-imposed challenges to go for after that. What I said here can likely change since Monolith has been getting free updates with content such as a hard mode & an upcoming boss rush.\n\nSince it's a roguelite and there's hundreds of potential rooms no playthrough will be the same which makes the game naturally replayable and fun to pick up every now and then.

The patterns of bullets in the regular rooms are interesting without being too challenging, but the bosses remind me of my favorite battles in the Touhou games.

Rooms are not only filled with enemies, but environmental dangers too. Mini bosses block your way to item shops and ability docks. Every floor has a dock which allows you to choose from 3 abilities. Between runs more abilities can be unlocked along with new guns and bombs. You will need multiple runs to learn enemy patterns and boss strategies. Boss fights look fantastic and all have a huge array of attacks you will need to learn to defeat them.\n\nMonolith consists of 5 levels -- each getting tougher than the last -- all of which contain secret rooms holding high level upgrades. There are multiple endings and many achievements to chase.

The catch is that the ammo is limited, and some weapons are barely better than the default, or in some rare cases even worse, leading to situations where you need to replace your low ammo god weapon with a pretty bad revolver.\nYour ship doesn't get expodantially stronger as you complete floors like most roguelites (damage upgrades are rare and really expansive in shops). Instead, the main goal is to increase your max ammo in order to keep the actually good weapons for longer.\n\nPros:\n-Tight controls and overall the gameplay feels solid, hitboxes are what you expect.\n-Upgrades/Pickups tell you exactly what they do when you hover over them\n-Good sense of progression with new store unlocks.\n-Music is great\n-Addictive\n\nCons:\n-Damage/Max ammo upgrades are not guaranteed to spawn, you could play until the final boss without ever having the chance to pick one up, making the later bosses bullet sponges.

Enough enemy variations that each room is fresh, but not so many that you can't learn patterns.  Visual vocabulary is on point - enemies that look the same function the same with well telegraphed attacks, and stand out against the background and impassable blocks... rooms are easy to assess quickly.  Also nice video options with fun effects.  No color deficient option, but I think they planned their color schemes around it anyway (from what I understand, correct me if I'm wrong).\n\nYou can use KB+M or controller.  KB+M feels natural and skills are rebindable.  Controller is rebindable too, and movement is analog though the ship only moves at one speed (aside from the dash).  Simple, easy to learn moveset (fire, bomb, dash).  Fluid and fun, with nice animations adding to the feel.\n\nAmmo is a cool twist on the randomly generated weapons.  Some of the most powerful don't have as much as you want; but picking when to switch and to what makes for interesting decision points, and the weapons and upgrades are plentiful.  \"This gun rules, but I'm at ~20% ammo and still have to kill the mini-boss... do I risk falling back on my crummy (but passable) base gun against it or search for a store/upgrade? If I run out, I'll lose the heal and scrap bonus...\"\n\nMeta-progression adds more weapon types to the pool, and each really feels different in how it uses the 6-notch clip/charge bar (upper left in the video).  Fire rates and spreads change your playstyle - line up enemies, bunch them up, charge in, dash behind cover, which to target first, etc.  Frequent updates so far too, including weapons and ships.  Unsure how long they plan to keep it up, but I hope it's a while.\n\nFast, difficult, fair, claustrophobic rooms (on a map you can teleport on, no backtracking through old rooms!), fun weapons, intimidating bosses with familiar and intense patterns.

There's many aspects that are so good... but...  The thing is, the flaws it does have are almost game-breaking.  Flaws that almost killed the entire thing for me within 10 minutes of starting it up the first time, and they have not and will not get better.   But we'll get to that in a bit.  I'll also point out:  I have more time with this one than Steam shows.  I hate having to point that out every bloody time, but.... Steam is Steam.\n\nAt it's heart, Monolith is a fairly basic roguelike.  Go through each given floor, which is made of many rooms in a way similar to Binding of Isaac, collecting various items and weapons, buying stuff from shops, clobbering enemies, and fighting huge bosses.  \n\nThe gameplay is that of a twin-stick game of course, except that unlike most games in the genre, this is a bullet-hell game.  Complete with hyper-complicated bullet patterns and a general \"clog the screen with pain\" sort of design to basically everything.  You'll find tons of different types of bad guys, whether they be the dinky little weak ones, or the gigantic mean ones that spray fireballs all over the place.  Enemy patterns are greatly varied, and well thought out.  Bosses are also well done.... mostly.  There's a couple of problems that occur with certain ones, and you're likely to spot them the instant you see them.  But nothing that's actually broken here.\n\nTo help you survive against the onslaught, you've got STUFF to collect.  The main thing you'll be after is weapons.  Your basic gun is weak and sad, but grab a new gun, and you'll be able to dish out some real damage.  Weapons are nicely varied in their effects, however, they have limited ammo, and managing this is one of the things you must master.  It's not easy to do, either, particularly since items of any sorts, whether they're pickups or weapons, dont stick around.  They pop the moment you leave the room they are in.  This sounds kinda bad at first, but after enough time you learn how to manage this, often avoiding specific rooms based on how much ammo you have left in your current weapon, so that you time it properly to get a new one just as it runs out.   There are also shops, stuffed full of various shiny things to buy.  The items you buy are kinda simplistic, compared to many such games.  You're not going to be buying complicated gizmos that do who knows what.  You'll be buying fairly basic things, like minor healing, permanent damage increases, weapons, and various other things.  However, the game does a good job of still keeping the shops interesting, which is actually kinda hard to do.  But it keeps you wanting to find them, and it's satisfying to buy stuff.  Aside from shops, there are all sorts of different special rooms, including one that gives you permanent passive effects, which is one of the main types of \"powerups\" you can find.   And your final advantage is the use of screen-clearing bombs, which come in different types, each type having an additional effect when used.  You can hold six of these at once, which sounds like alot but you definitely have to be careful with them.  Oh, and you have a dash/dodge move as well, but... to be honest, it's not all that useful.  The ability to zoom fast in a specific direction tends not to help all that much when you're in the middle of a complex bullet pattern.\n\nAnd here we come to what I consider to be the big giant problem with the game:  The controls.  Firstly:  It's going to force the use of analog sticks only.  In a bullet hell game, this is typically a huge no-no, to the point where it's absolutely baffling if a game does this.  Secondly, and far worse, is the ship's speed:  It's WAY TOO FAST.  Or I guess I should say, it's way too fast without having any way to slow it down.  In bullet hell games of any type, there's pretty much always a way to get your ship to slow the hell down.  Generally, this is done through the use of a specific button that cuts the ship's speed in half.  It creates the precision that's necessary to deal with nasty bullet patterns.  This, however, lacks that.  The overdone speed of your ship creates artificial difficulty simply because you're going to crash into things that you otherwise wouldnt.  Bullet-hell patterns are reliant on your ability to squeeze between shots, which is where the precision aspect comes in... but here, your ability to do that is hampered simply due to how fast you are moving.  Like the analog bit, the fact that this problem is even here is utterly baffling to me.  It's the sort of thing that makes me go \"How was this not spotted as an issue during development?\".   \n\nIt creates alot of frustration.... despite the fact that the game is actually pretty easy.  I cleared it for the first time within 90 minutes of getting the game (I have alot of experience with bullet-hell games).  However, even a fully successful run still feels just IRRITATING due to those \"smack into stupid stuff because I'm out of control\" moments.  Instead of the satisfaction of a battle well fought, I always get a \"Well that was dumb\" feeling.  Considering how well made most aspects of the game are, this is a shame.  \n\nThe final problem is that of visual confusion.  There's too many times of bullets meshing together badly with other things of a similar color.  For example, in the battle against the Overlord, there is going to be a heck of alot of use of orange bullets against a red background being fired by an orange boss.  That, there, is a problem.  Now, to be fair, it's *very* hard to completely avoid visual confusion of the bad sort in this genre.  Seriously, it is.  MOST games dont manage to get completely away from it, and will have certain spots where it presents a major problem.  That however doesnt mean I'm not going to mention it.  If you're familiar with shmups though, you're probably used to dealing with this one.\n\nNow, as I said, those problems (aside from that last one) are.... pretty freaking huge.  Normally, I wouldnt tolerate them in a bullet hell game.  And by \"wouldnt tolerate them\" I mean \"would refund the game\".  But all of the good parts of the game are *really* good.  The fun weapons, creative enemies, interesting room layouts (did I mention all of the stuff like water or portals?  Lots of things to find in rooms), crazy bosses with an epic feel... it does all of these things so very, very well.  The difficulty is oddly low as I said, but that also means that this is a bit more accessible than many of these, which can be a good thing.  As opposed to something like Enter the Gungeon, which rips your face off and beats you over the head with it the moment you fire it up.  And there are ways to up the difficulty here, but even then it's still not THAT hard.  \n\nThose problems though... as always, I wish Steam had a \"neutral\" review option.  Sure, I enjoy the game, but if I'm going to review it, I have to be objective and honest about it, and I cant just ignore major issues like that, particularly when they permeate the entire game from start to finish.  There are a few other problems as well (such as certain weapon types being useless, like charge weapons, at least as of this writing) but they arent nearly as bad.\n\nAs long as you're aware of the potential pitfalls with this one though, as long as you can deal with frustration caused by problems that seriously shouldnt be there... you're probably going to get some real fun out of this one.\n", "timestamp_created": 1500717178, "timestamp_updated": 1500717178, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.537973", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33711310": {"recommendationid": "33711310", "author": {"steamid": "76561198109626876", "num_games_owned": 1662, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 706, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511116412}, "language": "english", "review": "Yeah, I know, \"twin-stick roguelikes\" are a dime a dozen these days, but believe me, you'd be doing yourself one heck of a disservice not to stop and grant this particular specimen a good honest look, especially if you tend to be more concerned with the \"shooter\" portion of the equation.\n\nWhile there is an unobtrusive background story present, the blink-and-you-miss-it tutorial tells you all you really need to know: move, aim/shoot, dash, bomb. From there it's all about blasting and dodging your way through a short but never boring series of overhead-view dungeons populated by all manner of meanies and traps, though thankfully the next shop, weapon cache, or permanent upgrade is never too far away, and even a little practice pays dividends. While it might take controller-bound shooter vets a bit of time to get used to bullet-weaving with an analog stick, movement mechanics are finely tuned and your plucky little ship's hitbox is quite forgiving, so you can almost always manage to slip your way out of trouble.\n\nBriefly note the \"almost\" disclaimer - while the dungeons are only semi-random (the rooms are hand-designed but their arrangement changes every run) and usually give players a more than fair chance to emerge unscathed, every once in awhile you'll enter a chamber and encounter an enemy unloading a clip in your face almost before you can blink, with little room to maneuver. Moreover, while there aren't any truly \"bad\" special weapons or enhancements to find (and the achievements list challenges you to finish without them outright), from time to time your current armament will simply be a poor match for the adversary you've stumbled upon, and you'll have little choice but to grit your teeth and flail your way through.\n\nMind you, I must emphasize that the above situations are mere occasional speed bumps amidst an otherwise sublime ride: your progress is auto-mapped each run and completed rooms can be instantly teleported to, making exploration a breeze. Enemies not only drop cash which is both spent at shops and tallied for a final score, but charge a multiplier as you dispatch them without taking a hit, whilst simultaneously daring you to swoop in close and clear each room quickly to claim maximum rewards. Top it all off with a fistful of secrets to suss out, carried-over unlocks which can be toggled off if you wish, and some white-knuckle boss fights and you've got yourself one of Steam's most pleasant out-of-nowhere surprises. Oh, and not long before this was typed the developer added a bunch of extra stuff.\n\nLong story short: there's a demo on itch.io, download it, play it (it runs like a champ even on non-gaming machines, and looks and sounds great all the while), get a taste of what all the fuss is about. I'm more than willing to predict that most of you interested enough to do so will come racing back over here to offer the creators some well-deserved cash for the full version; if there is any justice in this world this highly-talented developer will rightly reap success, praise, and additional opportunities to showcase what the indie scene is truly capable of.", "timestamp_created": 1500693304, "timestamp_updated": 1500694029, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33702705": {"recommendationid": "33702705", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027824903", "num_games_owned": 248, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 977, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 73, "last_played": 1513903191}, "language": "english", "review": "An exellent and extremely polished bullet-hell roguelite that deserves more attention. \n\nPros --\n - Gameplay is engaging, fun, exciting, and just the right amount of difficult. \n - Art is beautiful, readable, and unique\n - This is the only game I've played where I would consider buying the soundtrack. It's incredible, and it increases in intensity and gravity as you progress through each stage. First area is a lighthearted, carefree chiptune, while last area is an grave, epic song that lets you know you're near the end\n - Full suite of weapons, upgrades, and pick ups\n - Has progression\n - Pacing is very on point. One of my main criticisms of Enter the Gungeon and Binding of Isaac was their slow pace, where runs can take upwards of 45 mins. I don't know that I've had a run lasting over 20 minutes in this game. It allows itself to be quick and exciting without being frenetic or making the player feel rushed\n - I literally (yes, literally) have not found a single bug in over 9 hours of play. \n - Unique and interesting setting filled with fun characters\n - Bosses all feel unique and different from each other\n - Price is too low; I wish I could throw more money at this developer!\n - THE DEVS ARE STILL ADDING CONTENT! The most recent patch added so much stuff that it could have been a paid DLC (but it was free)\n\nCons -- few and far between \n - I personally have some small issues with balance. Some weapons are bit too powerful, some too weak. Some bosses are disproportionally difficult for their area, while a couple are a bit too easy.\n - The progression goes by a bit too fast. There's a good deal of it, but I feel that you get all of it too easily. \n - This isn't a game with hundreds of hours of new content. That being said, after 9 hours I still have a ton of stuff left to do. So, not as long of a 100% as the Binding of Isaac or Nuclear throne, but still plenty to do. The game decides not to draw out its length, which I can certainly respect.\n\nConclusion -- \nThis game is wonderful. I come away happy every time I play it. Unceasingly fun, easy to get into but hard to master, and a captivating and charming atmosphere.

Everything feels right, from shooting to moving to even the \"dash\" move - I was so relieved to find the game didn't try to build itself around an invulnerable dodge roll like I see in so many other games. Very simple affair, dodge bullets, shoot ghosts. Get weapons and feel good until they run out of ammo. Use bombs to get out of bad situations.\n\nTook me about 8 hours to beat the TLB on Hard mode. An engaging little challenge, and to me it seems the game would rather be entertaining, straightforward and polished than outright \"ha ha gotcha idiot\" hard for no reason. Not a huge amount of awful esoterica to get your head around, you can just pick up and play. Game is very straightforward about rewarding you for playing well via a money multiplier mechanic, and forgiving of small mistakes. Perfect to enjoy over a lazy weekend or so.\n\nGood things:\n- Bombs are fun to use, liberally supplied and help make up for things that would otherwise be quite rough. You can play it fast and loose, which I love.\n- The bosses are pretty well-put together. Nice variety without being gimmicky. Definitely the part about this game I like the most. I'd love to see a boss rush mode.\n- The \"intensity\" setting alongside the difficulty is a cute idea, letting you set a tempo (as in: do more damage, take more damage) for the game independent of core difficulty.\n- Art style is coherent, functional, slick and well-presented. I see too many indie action games hampered by a reliance on screenshake - even the default setting in this game is perfectly fine, and you get lots of different settings for it.\n- Instant fast travel takes lots of tedium out of traversing the areas.\n- Tiny player hitbox. Everyone loves tiny hitboxes. You'd have to be nuts not to like tiny hitboxes.\n\n\"Maybe\" things:\n- Game rolls fairly light on many of the upgrade/weapon elements. Might leave some roguelite fans out in the cold who want to build immense, game-breaking synergies, but as more of an arcade shoot-em-up guy I like the straightforward balance this lends the game. Difficult to get screwed over by bad drops.\n- Lots of grinding for gameplay unlocks. I'm not really into this beyond the most minimal implementation, and it seems like after clearing the Hard mode TLB twice in a row I should be able to afford more things. Some like this though, I'm sure. Being able to remove certain unlockables from the item pool is a nice player-friendly option though.\n- On hard mode the game relies a lot on death bullets/attacks to keep things interesting. It ends up adding a nice dynamic at times, having to hold your fire around certain enemies, but it can sometimes feel like you're taking unavoidable damage for being aggressive. (This is why the game is so generous with bombs, use them!)\n- Some things like trophies or how certain cosmetic things are triggered aren't well-explained. \n\nBad things:\n- Some of the sounds are a little off. Some enemies / attacks produce sounds that sound like they would be \"player taking damage\" in any other game, so it's a little distracting.\n- A few rough things about certain boss bullet patterns, like not being warned of bullets suddenly spawning at the bottom of the screen, etc. Just small things.\n- The \"green halo\" effect on certain enemies in Hard mode that sucks you in towards them is a very frustrating thing to include. Hardly a dealbreaker though.\n\nJust a straightforward, fun little game. I hope the team does well out of it.", "timestamp_created": 1500570647, "timestamp_updated": 1500570647, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.536232", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33668321": {"recommendationid": "33668321", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041753179", "num_games_owned": 511, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 2335, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512695382}, "language": "english", "review": "great game, a little gem mixing traditional bullet hell with rogue-like exploration. Very clever.\nWith the last update I think it has enough amount of content to justify the price.\n\nI just have some complaint with this game:\n\n-I'd say that the rooms are too small and sometimes you can't avoid taking hits. I think some room should be rebalanced.\n-Something you should have from the start are the invincibility frames while you evade. In any case it's not a very reliable move, but the fact you can't evade without taking damage unless you get the power-up, makes it much less reliable. It can be used to sprint away from enemies though.\n-the game is a bit too much luck-based because of the randomness of power-ups. Not too much.\n-I think the voltaic power-up should also protect from ice slow downs. I understand it makes you invulnerable to elecricity, but it's too situational to be valuable. As it is now I find it almost useless.\n-game modes in which you have 5 or 1 hit points that can't be expanded are crazy. How am I supposed to beat those? :D They would be better if I could expand my HPs during the run.\n\n\nSaid this I strongly recommend this game for lovers of rogue-like Isaac style.

A close resemblance to Binding of Isaac, or Enter the Gungeon, and many other top down shooter roguelikes, but with a crunchy pixel, distinctly run-down sci fi shmup flavor.\n\nMonolith is a roguelite in the roguelike genre - there is permanent progression in the way of unlockable upgrades and a 'home base' after each encounter, so new items get added to your runs. Many of these items are also toggleable, so if you unlock an upgrade you  end up disliking, you can turn it off so it no longer appears in future runs. This lets you customize your RNG just that little bit to help get rid of some of the bad-feels that can happen ina roguelike when you just get a really lame upgrade.\n\nGameplay has a simple loop: enter room, blow everything up, go to next room. Rooms resolve quickly, and dungeons are randomly generated and laid out the same way an old NES Zelda dungeon (orr the afore mentioned Gungeon/BoI) would be laid out, grid style. Treasure rooms, upgrade rooms, shops and miniboss rooms litter each floor as well as the main boss room. The game can be played with keyboard and aiming mouse, or as dualstick with a controller. I played it both ways and I don't particularly have a preference just yet except to say that like always, aiming with the mouse is more precise, since there's a direct crosshair for what you're aiming at, freeing you up to just concentrate on moving. You have access to a lightspeed dash (which can be upgraded into a true teleport to gain invincibility), and bullet clearing bombs to help you wiggle out of situations. Your hitbox is clearly shown as a bright green pixel, a color that always stands out on the screen. You can disable the hitbox visual if you really want, but given the game is a (forgiving, but still a) bullet hell shmup and you need to know exactly how close you can dodge, I see no reason to disable it - it's not intrusive and only helps.\n\nThe learning curve is pretty steep - there's a short tutorial that gives you the basics, a starter boss, and then you're tossed in. The first floor right up to the boss is pretty forgiving, then the stops get pulled out and the game only gets more intense from there. So far I've made it about halfway through the 4th floor on runs before exploding. Your ship is pretty hardy, and between frequent drops and pickups, and money to spend at stores, as well as bombs, you do get a lot of margin for error, making those learning times easier to handle rather than instantly exploding.\n\nSpeaking of items - weapons receive randomly generated properties, meaning a fireball isn't always a fireball - it might explode into more projectiles, freeze enemies, lock on, split, charge, or more. You can only hold one weapon at a time, and they have limited (though generous) ammo stocks. You're rewarded for swapping to new weapons if you have ammo left in the old, so you're constantly getting new weapon types throughout a run.\n\nThe game feels satisfying and responsive to play, and rewards skill with combo multipliers that increase your money income, and a higher score at the end of runs used to purchase new upgrades. The music is enjoyable, and the art style evokes a retro-style dungeon crawler full of pixeled explosions and lasers. It's also only eight dollars - at full price! A steal for the content you get.\n\nAn easy recommendation to the top-down shooter fan, and people looking for a new, perma-progression roguelite with a bit different flavor than the horror-style BoI, or the irrevenent space western slash fantasy of Gungeon.

I believe that randomization and procedural content are precision tools, not flamethrowers and blunt-force hammers like they tend to be used. Too many games just throw a few mechanics into a blender and let it procedurally puke out a mediocre attempt at a game.\n\nBut this game, Monolith, does it *right*. It *feels* like a good roguelike. If I have any complaint it's that some of the rooms repeat a little too often and become recognizable kinda fast, and some of the weapons feel like they just plain suck in comparison to the others, but overall it's downright fun.\n\nIt's quick enough that it isn't a slog to get further, and even then the available items and upgrades are numerous enough that you tend to be reasonably well equipped for what lies ahead, rather than feeling like you have to restart if you don't get some good stuff on the first level or two. The sounds are solid and the music rocks, and the pixel art style is lovely and consistent. Enemies are pretty varied and the controls are perfectly tight - you can really squeeze between some narrow bullet gaps which makes for some very satisfying bullet hell boss type scenarios.\n\nI'm quick to criticize the use of procedural content, but Monolith really uses it right. I've enjoyed poking at it and getting further, and in doing so earning currency to unlock some new powerups, weapons, and such which helps give you a sense of progress even when you die.\n\nIn my opinion it's got a great look and feel, solid sound, and does a roguelike shoot 'em up pretty damn right.", "timestamp_created": 1500509721, "timestamp_updated": 1500509721, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.457256", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33654223": {"recommendationid": "33654223", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999224175", "num_games_owned": 360, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 398, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501275910}, "language": "english", "review": "if you like downwell/isaac/gooooood shmups, this is for you! beautiful game.", "timestamp_created": 1500480382, "timestamp_updated": 1500480382, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33651278": {"recommendationid": "33651278", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048937024", "num_games_owned": 247, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 2301, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510969849}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is a hidden gem.

This is a hardcore shmup with a cushion, so you can get a taste of the real deal without getting blown to smitheerens after one mistake.\n\nThere's something incredibly satisfying in how the ship controls.

If you like twin stick shooters and old school aesthetics then its well worth a look. \n\nIt follows the basic structure of Binding of Isaac with its random arrangements of rooms each time you play, but the action is more bullet-hell shooter. Weapons have random attributes and limited ammo, which keeps the gameplay varied and interesting. While the guns themselves don't upgrade, you can power yourself up with extra health and abilities on each floor, and if you do find a gun you want to keep hold of then its possible to buy more ammo. \n\nThe difficulty starts off fairly chilled and ends up pretty dangerous. I would say if you aren't into bullet dodging then things might feel a bit too busy on later floors, and some of the bosses can feel a little harsh. But you got health at least, and bombs will clear all enemy bullets if you get in trouble (top tip: 'autobomb' upgrade uses a bomb and saves your health if you get hit).\n\nTo be honest, this game can kill me as much as it likes, I just love playing it anyway. The graphics and sound are perfect re-creations of the nes style I grew up with, if it wasn't for the number of sprites on screen I'd swear I was playing some lost 30-year-old game. \n\nSo in conclusion, its a polished blend of action and nostalgia, simplicity and variety.

Es dif\u00edcil como su puta madre, pero la progresi\u00f3n de habilidad es m\u00e1gica, y puedes avanzar niveles que en la anterior run parec\u00edan imposibles simplemente con la pr\u00e1ctica. No s\u00e9 ni c\u00f3mo lo hacen para que sea un avance tan disimulado pero que te hace sentir tan jodidamente bien. Sin duda, uno de mis t\u00edtulos de steam favoritos.\nEn cuanto a jugabilidad respecta, creo que lo he dejado claro antes. Simple, pero eficaz. Muchas mejoras y armas con distintas habilidades que junto a la generaci\u00f3n procedural lo hacen un juego infinito en el que nunca jugar\u00e1s la misma partida dos veces. Los enemigos, una vez te acostumbras a ellos, son f\u00e1ciles de predecir, pero siempre suponen un reto. Esto genera un nivel de aprendizaje inmutable, pero una vez ves el avance que has hecho, alucinas. Y por no hablar de los bosses. Uffff los bosses. Lo mejor de este juego. Tampoco destaca por su gran variedad, habiendo dos o tres bosses distintos por nivel, pero son tan distintos entre ellos y tan originales que no s\u00e9 ni como describir la felicidad de ver algo as\u00ed. Solo por los bosses, este juego se merece todo mi dinero. Y los minibosses tambi\u00e9n son bastante originales. En conclusi\u00f3n, la jugabilidad es DIVERTIDA, y te picas con tanta facilidad que es imposible no volver a intentarlo despu\u00e9s de morir.\nEl arte es maravilloso, simple pero claro. A veces es mejor eso que una pantalla sobrecargada en la que te cuesta diferenciar a los enemigos y las balas. Esto aqu\u00ed no suele pasar a pesar de ser un bullet hell, y creo que no he probado ning\u00fan juego as\u00ed de bien dise\u00f1ado (creo que solo Ikaruga).\nRespecto a la est\u00e9tica, es algo extra\u00f1a. Mezcla la ciencia ficci\u00f3n, siendo tu personaje una nave espacial, con elementos m\u00e1gicos como las brujas y los fantasmas. No lo digo como algo malo, m\u00e1s bien como una curiosidad que me hace mucha gracia.\nSiguiendo con la est\u00e9tica, la m\u00fasica creo que es uno de sus puntos flacos. Y no, no es que tenga mala m\u00fasica. De hecho, tiene un banda sonora muy buena, el problema para m\u00ed est\u00e1 en el conjunto. Si bien la m\u00fasica est\u00e1 muy bien, no considero que pegue adecuadamente con la est\u00e9tica y el momento, siendo a veces demasiado feliz para la tensi\u00f3n que hay y pegando m\u00e1s en sitios como la tienda, el spawn y otros puntos de descanso. Sin embargo, tambi\u00e9n es cierto que pasa con una o dos canciones, las dem\u00e1s est\u00e1n realmente bien.\nEl \"lore\" de este juego no nada profund\u00edsimo, pero s\u00ed que hay que indagar un poco en \u00e9l. Cada enemigo tiene su historia (que se descubre despu\u00e9s de ser vencido por \u00e9l y hablando con el gato), y la motivaci\u00f3n del protagonista es misteriosa pero clara: obtener el poder infinito que se encuentra al final de la torre. Conforme avanzas vas indagando en el lore, y el jefe final tiene una muy breve historia (que hay que buscar, no te la regalan) que me ENCANTA.\nEn conclusi\u00f3n, este juego es de lo mejorcito de steam, adem\u00e1s de estar a un precio muy asequible.

Y no poco precisamente, a\u00f1adiendo bosses, enemigos, mejoras, armas y miles de salas este 10 de junio, TOTALMENTE GRATIS.

This highlights one of the coolest things about this game to me; it's very good at giving you a lot of room to improve (which is obviously an important quality in a rogue-lite). Whether it's how cautious you are going into uncharted rooms, or simply getting better at dodging a certain boss' relentless onslaught of bullets. Goals outlined by achievements I initially felt would be near-impossible became challenging but [i]surmountable[/i].\n\nThe art direction/aesthetic of the game is a real treat. Fresh, yet reminiscent of 16-bit without feeling like a lazy retro phone in. Really interesting enemy design, charming NPCs, while bosses look/feel dire and dangerous to face. Also, the soundtrack is pretty great to say the least. A clear amount of care and attention to detail has been put into this game by Team D-13, and the price is frankly an absolute steal.

I haven't fought a boss that made me feel as though it was just a reskin of another boss.\n\nYour ship starts off with an infinite ammo basic gun and each floor gives you the chance to upgrade to a new gun with limited ammo. Once you run out of ammo for that gun it disappears and you have to use your basic gun. Guns have modifiers on them and the number of modifiers ranges from 2 to 4. Of the weapons currently in game some of them feel a little underwhelming and don't really perform very well unless you receive the right modifiers on them. On the other hand weapons like fireball and razor are really powerful even with their base form and become game-breaking with the right upgrades. There are quite a few weapons in game as of the writing of this review and the devs have been posting new weapons they are going to add on Twitter. \n\nThe game also has an upgrade system for your ship. Every floor there will be an upgrade station that will allow you to pick from three available upgrades. The upgrades differ each floor so if you want two you will just have to pick one and hope the other shows up again.\n\nAs you destroy enemies you can pick up the debris they leave behind. This debris is the game's currency which can be used at shops to buy items. These items include max health upgrades, max ammo upgrades, new weapons, damage upgrades and more! If you get lucky you might find a gambling shop too. Instead of outright buying items in this shop you spend money for a chance at an item; Risk/Reward!\n\nEach time you die you are sent back to your main hub from which you can interact with funny NPCs, furnish the room with the help of a friendly cat, or listen to the game's OST. Also the currency you collect can be used to unlock new items which will appear in future playthroughs.\n\nOverall this game is a fresh take on the rogue-lite genre and definitely deserves more exposure.", "timestamp_created": 1497678766, "timestamp_updated": 1497678766, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0,

Une bouton pour afficher la carte (petit plus qui d\u00e9chire : on peut cliquer sur une salle d\u00e9j\u00e0 visit\u00e9e pour s'y t\u00e9l\u00e9porter instantan\u00e9ment, tr\u00e8s pratique pour visiter et farmer rapidement un niveau !).

It also seems like it is a bit under the radar right now, so I'll gladly review it.\n\nFirst off, it's a roguelite shoot 'em up that's quite apparently inspired by games like Binding of Isaac, Downwell, and other roguelite titles. Those familiar with BoI will quickly find themselves on familiar turf, with familiar staples like secret rooms hidden between rooms with three or more sides, shopkeepers, \"devil\" deals, and randomized layouts and bosses.\n\nIn that sense, if you're looking for originality in gameplay, this game does leave something left to be desired. There's not a whole lot of unique mechanics presented in Monolith. \n\nFurthermore, there isn't really a whole lot of upgrades and weapons to experiment with, especially if you compare it to the massive variance that Enter the Gungeon or Binding of Isaac--it's closer to Downwell in the amount of upgrades that you can acquire. If a large item pool what you're looking for in a roguelite, Monolith may fall short in that area. \n\nHowever, where Monolith truly shines is its execution; the pacing is quick and engaging, the music is infectious, the spritework is imaginative and fascinating...I could go on. Monolith succeeds in taking the roguelite experience and making it really shine.\n\nThere is nuiance in gameplay; for instance, choosing not to pick up a weapon early on and opting to hold on to your default shot-type for awhile can reap you more rewards in the future (Namely, a higher maximum ammo capacity, and more scrap.) \n\nBosses are definitely the height of the experience, providing the best bullet patterns and the most challenge the game has to offer.\n\nOh, and the shopkeeper is a talking cat.

With so many games going for the same trophy what makes this stand out? \n\n#1: Refined gameplay that rewards skillfull mastery of movement. \n#2: Awsome arsenal of Amunitions. Heaps of guns and modifiers make every shot interesting. \n#3: Tons of bosses and enemies in different configurations creating lots of different challenges.\n#4: Secrets, unlockables, and surprises. each run gives credits that can be spent in the lobby shop on game changing perks.\n#5: It feels... different. This point is somewhat hard to quantify, but for me is one of the most important. There have been other great games in this genre, such as Enter the Gungeon, but this game plays faster and more claustrophobic than those games, which makes someone that has tried it all feel like a roguelike newborn. \n\nMy final point might make me sound like a Pompous Poopie-too-good, But my favorite thing about this game is it's challenging!

Movement is crisp and responsive, and there is a dash like a few other current games in the top-down format (Nuclear Throne, Enter the Gungeon). However, unlike in these games, the dash is not slow, nor does it follow a rigid course - it is simply a massive speed boost for a fraction of a second. In most games, I feel the foundations of movement provide a strong baseline for how the rest of the game is framed. In Monolith, it is even fun just to move around. The only gripe I have is that I play on a controller - the sensitivity is high on the sticks, and as a result there was one time I took damage because it didn't go the direction I wanted, which is probably my fault anyways.\n\nThe shooting is simple - on a controller, your rotation and whether or not you are firing is controlled just by the right stick. The projectiles are relatively small, and so are some of the targets, so on top of dodging lots of projectiles, you're also trying to split your attention to make sure you're dealing damage. It's something largely foreign to the popular body of games in the genre, and is a wonderful thing to have picked up from bullet hells. Also part of the shooting are the weapons - they are mystical and amazing until you get the hang of them, at which point they're just fun to play with. The mutators for them stack like tear mutators in The Binding of Isaac, but because of Monolith's ammunition system (your non-standard weapons have a generous ammunition stockpile. This is to avoid players getting one ridiculous combo and thus carried by their items [this also allows them to regularly award really awesome items]), the game doesn't just decide itself based on the strength of the items you find. \n\nI could write a lot more, but I'll end here.\n\nBuy this game.", "timestamp_created": 1496965393, "timestamp_updated": 1496965393, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32278644": {"recommendationid": "32278644", "author": {"steamid": "76561198092318716", "num_games_owned": 202, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1689, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500518918}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game, great price.", "timestamp_created": 1496964090, "timestamp_updated": 1496964090, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32278279": {"recommendationid": "32278279", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009909296", "num_games_owned": 235, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 118, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500474873}, "language": "english", "review": "A SHMUP with rogue-lite elements...

You are a ship that shoots bullets (:O), acquires different weapons, and maneuvers around enemy projectiles via moving and dashing. You're also equipped with bombs which can save you from taking damage in a tricky situation. \n\nEvery room is a different assortment of enemies in a different layout. And while the variety of enemies isn't massive, much like the Binding of Isaac, it doesn't need to be. The core gameplay of being able to move in any direction whilst blowing up undead, robots, and other interesting creatures is insanely satisfying. What I also am beginning to discover is that the more you play the more secrets in the game you begin to discover, which adds to the already potent longevity of the game.\n\nThere are many unique things on each floor, some on every floor and some only are seen every now and then.\n\nEvery floor has a weapon room and an upgrade room, and usually along with a shop of some description.\n\nThe weapons are all very satisfying to use and unique from one another. Every weapon also has some attributes attached to it that are randomized. For example: reflecting bullets, bullets splitting upon hitting enemies, and a whole lot more neat things. I had a time where every moment I would fire the screen would be FILLED with lasers. Something like a triple shot lasers that reflected off walls. And I for one, am a fan of obliterating room with lasers instantly, although usually it isn't that easy. Which I'm okay with. \n\nThe upgrade room item pool is not massive, but it's similar to Downwell in a sense. The upgrades are simple but they certainly support different playstyles and desires. Heck, one upgrade just spawns 4 extra powerful weapons to choose from.\n\nShops are pretty simple as you can probably imagine, but there are different varieties of shops, something I feel you should discover for yourself, it is worth mentioning that there's a fair amount of variety in there as well.\n\nThere are some other types of special rooms you will encounter as well as I've discovered.\n\nFinally, the bosses. All the bosses in the game are wonderfully designed both in their art design and their fight mechanics. All of them are very unique from one another and are very fulfilling and satisfying to fight. There's a great assortment of mini bosses scattered around each floor as well which are ALSO... yes, very unique from one another.\n\nAnd of course, it's worth mentioning that the aesthetic, art, and music of the game is top notch and melds perfectly together.\n\n\nUPDATE: Recently a new update for the game has come out, with the main introductions being new weapons, playable ships, and \"hard mode\".\n\nNow, this game does \"hard mode\" better than the vast majority of games. The majority of games will just scale things up in some way. \n\nMonolith's new hard mode makes most enemies behave differently in their bullet patterns or their movement, or both. More notably, it makes bosses have new bullet patterns and some bosses even get entirely new phases. Combined with this, something that I wasn't expecting, this is a spoiler: [spoiler] There's a new true final boss which is wondrous.\t[/spoiler]\n\nThis update is better than a lot of paid DLC and it's free, which is great. Adding to what I already believe is a highly overlooked gem.\n\n---\n\nAnyway, hopefully this was somewhat insightful.\n\nI'm someone who's played hardcore bullet hell games before so I feel right at home with the dodging and aiming, but even if you're not someone who plays shmups, this is quite accessible. The game has a low skill-floor but a very high skill-ceiling. if you're someone who has even a passing interest in rogue-likes, arcade games, or just blowing ghosts up while shooting fireballs out of a spaceship, then you really should buy it.\n\nThe price is ridiculous at 8 dollars. 5 years of development made something I feel is truly spectacular, and I certainly plan to play a more of this game in the future.", "timestamp_created": 1496928784, "timestamp_updated": 1500377249, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521739", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32264947": {"recommendationid": "32264947", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970563925", "num_games_owned": 906, "num_reviews": 92, "playtime_forever": 12, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496919133}, "language": "english", "review": "So, it's a SHMUP mixed with the rogueness of Isaac and the pixel perfect NES aesthetic of Shovel Knight.

Monolith is a fast paced bullet hell roguelike, the impressive debut effort of Team D-13. The visuals are crisp, clean, clear, and retro. The chip tunes are top knotch, and the gameplay is responsive, quick, and incredibly satisfying. You have expected access to bullet clearing bombs, health upgrades and healing, and money, which earns a multiplier as you avoid damage.The weapon pick ups act as temporary power ups, which was initially jarring, but the game is structured around this, and it fits seamlessly into the retro feel of the title. More worrisome are the limited number of weapon types. Although these weapon pick ups also come with several modifiers, resulting in hundreds of permutations, you may end up simply ignoring the weapon pick ups you don't like. Also included are passive perks, which are disappointingly weak. Few have any major impact on gameplay, and I would have liked to find more adventurous passives. The runs also feel too short, although that may be just that I'm having too much fun to want it to end. Monolith looks great, feels great, and plays great.

You control your little ship armed with a dash move and some bombs, and fire on enemies in each room, which you're locked into until the room is clear. You can teleport to any room you've already been to, and there are shops and other special rooms scattered about the map that you start to get a feel for. You'll upgrade your ship and gain new weapons to replace your starter, each with their own type defining how it's used, and modifiers that can make weapons fire twice as much, slow you down, fire faster, pierce through obstacles, and more. Beat the miniboss to unlock the gate to the floor boss, and keep going from there. \n\nI admittedly haven't gotten past Floor 3's boss, but the game's downright addicting. Even for someone who isn't good at shooter-style games, I found myself getting the hang of things very quickly, even dodging - the ship handles nicely, even if it takes a bit of getting used to, and the dodge move is a godsend. This game IS a bullet hell, though, even early on, especially the bosses. I can only imagine how they're going to get harder from here.\n\nI don't really know the story or if there is one, though it seems like there might be, I just need to get a bit farther. There's also upgrades you can buy in the \"lobby\" from a rather sarcastic cat...thing that likes making comments on whatever way you just died in, and also some surprisingly good advice. The dialogue with the cat's a lot of fun.\n\nDisability concerns? \nThe game isn't too big on screenwide flashing lights - the HUD flickers and distorts more and more as your health declines, but it isn't extreme, and a lot of the visual effects can be turned off in the settings (which I've done just because my computer is crappy). Enemies do flash white when at low health. The color scheme is generally light on dark. Your ship is white, and so are some enemies, but I, a legally blind person, haven't had too many moments where I felt like I lost track of my ship. There's a lot going on, and it can get quite chaotic, as should be expected from a bullet hell. Sound cues are nice, but don't seem really necessary to play the game. Text is difficult to read at times due to the font and some sort of antialiasing glitch. Color differentiation doesn't seem to matter; the HUD changes color as your health gets lower, but other than that I haven't seen anything that requires you to know what color something is to recognize it, items and such are indicated with text.\nTake with a grain of salt, since I've only played the first three floors. I'll edit as I play more.\n\nOverall, really enjoying it and I wish the game luck!

No, I have not been paid to write this review (though the Dev did give me a free key).\n\nFirst Impression Gameplay: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnRki3Z4wkE&feature=youtu.be\n\nFrom what I can tell, you start off in some kind of bad-ass killing machine after some kind of catastrophic event afflicts society.  You navigate the ship around each area, while controlling the direction the ship fires with the mouse.  Basically the standard format of this genre.  As you move around each stage, you'll encounter power-up rooms, stores, simple foes, advanced foes, and bosses.  Sometimes the exit is blocked by an environmental hazard which needs to be dealt with before you can move on.\n\nI absolutely love the sound track for this game.  Seriously it's awesome, and a throwback to gaming music of the past.  Graphics are simplistic, and are accurately depicted on the art displayed here on the steam store.  Controls are very responsive, and I did not run into any glitches or technical issues.\n\nAll in all, this is a very solid game.

Do I like the magnum even if it homes on the closest enemy, or will I only like it if it pierces enemies?  \n\nI'm a huge fan of roguelike and bullet hell shooters, so this will be something that will keep me occupied for some time.

This is helped a little by the random effects that the weapons will have attached to them (slowing enemies, shotgun style spreads, explosions, etc), and there may be more weapons to unlock as you play, but, as of the 4 hours I've put in to the game, the weapon pool can feel a little lacking.\n-Limited variety of ship upgrades to choose from. The game has upgrade rooms where you can pick one of three passives to apply to your ship (think Nuclear Throne end-of-level style upgrades). I think I've maybe seen about 5-6 different ones.\n\nI really enjoyed my time with this game.

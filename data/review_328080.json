Let me explain. \n\nI really like this type of game, or rather these types of games. Rise to Ruins is, at its core, a mash up of city builders, survival games, tower defense, and God games. It offers a decent number of buildings construct and some require others to be built first which creates a good sense of progression.  If you are playing with monsters active, which you should be, you will need to create defensive towers to help the villagers or else they are all going to die pretty quickly. Everything you costs resources that need to be collected by villagers or energy which you can gain from various sources around the map. \n\n Monsters are a serious threat if you are caught off guard and without a clear plan. They start off few and weak but quickly turn into swarms. Having a good maze of walls and defensive towers for monsters to navigate will become essential pretty quickly, and that is a good thing. Usually games of this type tend to be slow and leave the player with nothing to do for long stretches, not so much here. \n\n The problems I have with the game all stem from the incredibly stupid AI. The villagers seem to be easily confused and will just stop building for no reason. Some structures require materials that have to be produced in order to be built. This means that when you attempt to build a structure but do not have the needed materials it will get as far as possible but stop until you provide the needed materials. Usually the construction will then complete according to whatever number it is in the que. Usually. \n sometimes the game just fails to bother with a construction project, at all. This is particularly boggling when it is a project that DOES NOT REQUIRE any special materials. You can send a project to the front of the que, but that does not mean they will bother with it. The villagers will, instead, just keep building whatever they feel like building. This can be damning when you are attempting to rush the production of defenses.\n\n Another issue concerning villager is that death by dehydration is far too common. After creating several ways for the villagers to stay hydrated, including bottling facilities so they can take some liquid goodness with them, I STILL have frequent deaths from dehydration. If it is my fault I sure as hell can not see what I am doing wrong. I have plenty of water and yet my villagers insist on ignoring it and dying. If it is my fault then the devs need to add a note for the tutorial that makes it clear what is needed to prevent this.\n\nEDIT: It turns out the water issue was my fault. I was simply not producing enough water and it has been brought to my attention that water and food values carry different wrights, meaning that you need more water than food. \n\nMonster AI can be a little daft as well, with monsters absolutely refusing to attack a wall if there is an opening somewhere else. This is forgivable, however, considering the difficulty of managing the hordes as is. You WILL have to face hordes of enemies too, make no mistake. Zombies, spectres, flame elementals and more will simply spawn and charge your villagers most nights. I found this to be a fun, if somewhat frustrating, mechanic that had me spending the days preparing for the night while also trying to meet the needs of my villagers.\n\n The issues that the game currently has are not game breaking but can turn a good time sour quickly when you suddenly have construction projects that are mysteriously unable to complete of you have 10-20 villagers die of dehydration in a single day despite having over 100 water that no one is even drinking.\n\nI have faith that the devs will smooth out these issuews and I will gladly change this review to the entirely positive review I wan to give.

It's bloated, the garbage collection while revolutionary in 2002 is wonky at best and it handles memory usage in general, terribly because every interaction with the os is third hand.\n\nThe dev while I think he or she are/is awesome, pass this off as bloated AI but, after playing the game, I simply disagree. To qualify that statement just play Anno 1404 or even stronghold (a really old game) both of which were well ahead of their times' respectively in terms of graphics and AI, and the quality of the gaming experience are ones that still hold up today, despite their obvious vintage, and exhibit AI qualities I would consider to be far more rewarding and advanced than RtR. \n\nI have played the game and I do not think the AI justifies the overheads, this is not dwarf fortress, you are asking me for money to fund your hobby in advance.\n\n\nFurthermore, it seems to be plagued with identical issues in terms of performance Mincraft was a decade ago. Notch knew the JRE was limited, do you?\n\nTo cut a long story short, there are many other great platforms to launch this game on, many of which are free and offer significantly better performance so people like me can focus on the gameplay rather than the flaws, please look at them and stop romanticising about JAVA. Use it for JSP or SQL, it's a bad platform for anything other than old school motorola games or server side scripting, please.\n\nOtherwise, good game.\n\nAnd let me re-iterate. This is no joke, Java is simply a bad platform to make games with. You simply have to examine how sub-optimally it handles memory usage and uses handshakes with the kernel rather than native injection.\n\nAgain, it's a great game on a bad platform.\n\nRaybarg, to answer your question fully, I do think this game has potential, but the developers choices force me to give it a negative review. \"But why?\", you may say. Well. I can appreciate the dev has built the AI from the ground up and to be quite frank, that's ambitious. But nothing alters the fact the capability of JRE will consistently be significantly lower than the developers expectations. It's like an invisible barrier the game will never overcome.\n\nTo put that into perspective play Witcher 3 for ten minutes. How amazing does that game look and how interactive and real does the AI feel? Do you think that level of depth is achievable on Java? I can tell you the answer, an the answer is NO.\n\n\"But we are talking about AI\", you may argue. The developer has suggested the AI is more complex than the likes of Rimworld or Prison Architect but like I summarised, I simply disagree. The difference being Rimworld AI works beautifully, and triple speed doesn't stop a computer dead. I don't own an incapable computer and therefore I do not expect it to be brought to it's knees performing even the most rudimentary operations. But that is not because this is a BAD GAME, that is because the developer is using JAVA.\n\nWhy?\n\nYou are asking me questions because you feel hurt by the fact I made a negative review.

The most obvious one is Base Building. You have your villagers, they gather resources, build buildings, defend themselves against monsters and have their own set of needs and demands that must be met. This part closely resembles RimWorld, with the difference that you have no information whatsoever how everything works. Rise to Ruins seems like a game that wants players to sink their teeth into numbers, try build orders and ressource assignments, fail miserably and do better the next time around. Resources are stone, wood, and crystals, food and water all renewable in one way or another. You can dig yourself into mountains, assign prioorities to buildings and establish work orders. I can't stress the resemblance with RimWorld enough here. But compared to that, everything seems simpler, less polished. Of course I played Rise to Ruins in Alpha. It's difficult to establish several bases and explore the map, not because of the threat of monster attacks, but because it takes villagers forever to do just about anything. The AI isn't perfect yet either, with some of your villagers just standing around confused sometimes, eventually dying of hunger or thirst.\n\nThe second part is Tower Defense. Villagers probably aren't meant to hold up against hordes of monsters on their own, just now (Alpha) there are almost as much towers to choose from than any other building. Again, as of now, you have no wiki, no statistics. Yout don't know if it's better to build a more expensive tower or upgrade the cheap one you build already. Heck, you don't even know how the pathfinding of monsters work. Do they attack walls, or do they follow your \"maze\" ( I haven't gotten to the point where I could have built an actual TD maze yet)? It's for you to find out.\n\nThe third part is a kind of God Simulation. Those of us who remember Black & White won't fail to see the simliraties. Almost everything in the world can be turned into magic power that can be used to fuel magic towers, grow your crops or damage the monsters. I have to point out that this part especially isn't balanced out yet. At all. You can basically force grab all mosters on the map and turn them into even more mana in a big cooking pot. On the other hand, there are four offensive spells which all do about the same amount of damage/mana but neither of them is worth it.\n\nWhat do I think about this game? It looks very promising. The think-try-fail-rethink concept already works. Too little information, inconvienient controls and (sometimes) seemingly unbalanced gameplay are an issue. For a game like this, those things are exactly what defines it's playability and long-term motivation. Rise to Ruins offers TD meets RimWorld meets Black & White. The combination has a lot of potential to make for a great game.

All while doing this, managing your resources and trying to defend adds the extra spice to this game. The progression in this game is not boring, and the amount of options you have when building is great. The whole thing with essence too makes the game so much better. It allows you to change the weather, help the village with gathering resources, using magic, etc. I also like how there is a limit so you have to strategize on how to use it efficiently (as with everything else in the game).\n\nOn top of this...\n-The developer is very open to the community and works a lot on this. You can tell how much effort is put in just by seeing how much interaction the developer has with the community.\n-The music is well picked/made, and is not really annoying.\n-The pixel graphics are satisfying.\n-The timing on everything syncs well and captures you back into the game. This allows you to enjoy the game more, without stuff getting too stale too soon.\n\nAs for the cons, the UI can be pretty intimidating at the start and may make you want to back out-as it did with me, but don't let it scare you away. As I said earlier in the review, once you figure out what you're looking at, you realize the potential to everything in the game. \n\n\nThere's much more to add and I'm looking forward to it, and I'd say that my money was well spent on a game like this.", "timestamp_created": 1513676897, "timestamp_updated": 1513677101, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38426392": {"recommendationid": "38426392", "author": {"steamid": "76561198267045084", "num_games_owned": 39, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 84, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 84, "last_played": 1513673977}, "language": "english", "review": "this is game is a wonderful little game, i love this game already with only 55 mins on my play time! i would strongly recomend this game!", "timestamp_created": 1513672177, "timestamp_updated": 1513672177, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38421710": {"recommendationid": "38421710", "author": {"steamid": "76561198323444732", "num_games_owned": 106, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 558, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 201, "last_played": 1513648272}, "language": "english", "review": "This game gets really hard really fast.

Disasters await your well made village in an attempt to bring it to the verge of failure.\n\nWithout your godly powers your subjects will not last.

It's a steep climb to start. Playing Rise to Ruins is about learning to balance and prioritize what is important at the moment. And many players will fall, slip and lose their balance. \n\nIf you don't have the patience to dig in and look at what the game is doing and saying, this may not be the game for you. \n\nYou have to manage your village and distribute your villagers properly accross a multitude of jobs. You have to have food and water to last through the tough seasons, and there are tough seasons. You have to have shelter to protect your villagers from heat and cold, the hot summer and the cold winter can kill by themselves if things get out of hand. And you have to protect your village from the monsters that come when it's dark. But you are a god, and can guide and act through divine miracles... ok, spells. When telling them what to build and where comes up short, the magic you can use can fill in the gap. But that's another layer, resources harvested and monsters slain yeild free floating essense that you can harvest. The happiness of your villagers will refill your essense directly, keep them happy and safe and it will fill faster. \n\nIndividually, all your tools, the buildings, the defenses and your spells are not terribly strong. There is no overwhelming single button or single building solution. Especially the villagers, without your guiding hand, would be helpless. Learn to use your tools and the map around you however, and you can shape the world to your will. This game is about the satisfaction of learning to craft a thriving settlement. All the tools are there, but they expect you to learn them and master them. Rise to Ruins is not giving itself away, but is more than happy to be earned.\n\nThere are multiple difficulties. Peaceful, Traditional, Survival and Nightmare are the main settings. Custom lets you set the difficulty factors before the map starts, and the options are broad and potentially crushing if you're into that. Then there is Sandbox which lets you change settings and even the map on the fly. There is also a reasonably good map editing tool to make your own field of play and a small community of map builders as well.\n\nThe music is a nice background to the gameplay as well and lets you cycle through to the songs you like. \n\nThe graphics are simple but I find them both charming and suitable. Although there is a wealth of particles, so if particles are your thing, WELL. Have I got a game for you. There are also small little quirks in this game that give it a fun charm as well, from moments like seeing the ridiculous names that villagers and dogs get, to things like a villager leveling up after mating (Someone really upped their game that night).\n\nDisclaimer: This game is cpu intensive as you start to get into the meat of it. Its the calculations of wide range map alterations like the 'earthquake spell' and the constant decision making of the horde of villagers that will bog the computer down. If You're playing on a toaster, your enjoyment will be hindered. :(\n\nIf you got this far, thanks for reading, I've enjoyed this game quite a bit and I wish it continued success.", "timestamp_created": 1512726737, "timestamp_updated": 1512726737, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 78, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.874064", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38142760": {"recommendationid": "38142760", "author": {"steamid": "76561198127499008", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 4665, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2175, "last_played": 1513549703}, "language": "english", "review": "THIS.

Cada merda que acontece pode realmente ferrar com toda a sua log\u00edstica... Basta a \u00faltima linha de defesa ser penetrada (ou ignorada) que voc\u00ea pode acabar perdendo sua vila inteira! Por exemplo, uma \u00e1rvore come\u00e7ou a crescer no meio da minha trilha de torres, bloqueando a passagem: s\u00f3 fui perceber quando hordas e mais hordas de zumbis rodearam a entrada da minha vila e come\u00e7aram a me atacar por tr\u00e1s. \n\nN\u00c3O D\u00c1 PARA PRODUZIR ALDE\u00d5ES: se eles morrem, faz falta. Sua popula\u00e7\u00e3o aumenta naturalmente (mulher engravida, ap\u00f3s algumas esta\u00e7\u00f5es, o beb\u00ea nasce e os filhos crescem) ou por n\u00f4mades (que s\u00e3o destro\u00e7ados pelos monstros \u00e0 beira do caminho) e tamb\u00e9m morrem naturalmente (de velhice).

Ap\u00f3s construir uma defesa s\u00f3lida, fica muito mais f\u00e1cil ficar acomodado e, realmente, uma grossa, s\u00f3lida as vezes pode ser impenetr\u00e1vel pelo lado de fora, mas n\u00e3o pelo lado de dentro: existem muitos elos que podem simplesmente \"desligar suas torres\" incluindo linhas de abastecimento, transporte e produ\u00e7\u00e3o de muni\u00e7\u00e3o. basta algum desses estar comprometido que fode tudo. O que me leva ao \u00faltimo ponto: desastres naturais.\n\nN\u00c3O SE ACOMODE.

That being said I will write it half review half starting guide for the ones who are interested in the game.\nAs a side note I play this a lot in offline so my hours on record are alot more than what it says in Steam.\n\n\n1\u00ba The game is hard, and by that I mean [b]H-A-R-D[/b]. You will be bound to fail the first time, do not despair. The final goal of the game is ruin your rising village (hence the name Rise to Ruins). Some might complain about starving and dehydrating, yeah thats a common issue there, unless you build first the [b]food and water buildings[/b]... so in order to survive more days you need to perfect your early building planning.\n\n2\u00ba This games is a half tower defense for the time being. So the monsters will be quite strong in later stages of the game and if you do not plan correctly like building and improving the towers, and narrowing your entrance with walls you will have a very hard time defending your village. The monsters have resistances and vulnerabilities, so a varied tower building and improving is highly encouraged. Remember the ultimate goal of this game is Ruin your village. \n\nAside tower defenses you have the oportunity to have [b]Guards[/b] (Villager Job who specializes on fending off monsters and patrolling) and [b]Golems[/b] (An entity made of essence that will defend your village and can be upgraded) both of them have a specific defense building that let us recruit them. I must note the guards and golems sometimes go full Leroy Jenkins on a monster horde, my personal preference is golems over guards but I saw fulfilling maps with a good guard regiment.\n\n3\u00ba There are 2 main modes (aside difficulties) [b]World map[/b] (With a shared pool called Limbo for Villagers and Resources, and also monsters if you send them to that place, consider cleaning the limbo from monsters when you start a new village in a same World unless you want surprises) and [b]Skirmish[/b] that is basically independent villages that will only be affected by what happens inside that gameplay.\n\n4\u00ba There are two RNG events [b]Disasters[/b] they can hit you consecutively, and range from an eclise to an earthquake (and a lot more) so be prepared for them while you play. And the appearence of \"allied forces\" that is [b]Doggos[/b] (Pet Dogs) who are neutral mobs and [b]Nomads[/b] potential villagers so they will be hostile with every monster mob (rescue them). The hit-rate of the harmful RNG is influenced by the size of your village, that also influences the appearence of the \"allied forces\" so in early game you will be mostly safe unless you are hated by the RNG gods.\n\n5\u00ba Jobs, as I said before ther is Guard Job, but there are a lot more, every Job has its own building, yeah you will not full all the places in that job but you can change the job of the villagers if for some reason you lack manpower in that aspect. That being said the villagers sometimes fail to do their jobs due to 2 main reasons, aggro towards monsters and confussion and mainly due to the powers, and this takes us to the next point.\n\n6\u00ba Powers, right now they are limited. They are fuelled with [b]Essence[/b] aka Mana this resource will recharge slowly and also with the drops from the living beings and monsters. This powers let you interact with the world. That being said some are lackluster and some are essencial to the survavility of the village. But still they need improvement.\n\n-------------\nSide Notes:\n\n-The game runs in Java, so despite having that pixel look it needs a moderate specs computer.

games freezes for a few times within several seconds or doesnt run that smoothly. It's implemented in Java I think and uses up quite a lot of memory while running (at least once when I checked it did).\nBut the other times - which is most of the time - its perfect! Really calm and beautiful music in the background, quite a lot of strategy to think about but at the same time yet simplistic enough so that it didnt frustrate me. Simple pixelart design which in the same way gives everything a beautiful and simple look. Maps are cool and you can decide where in the beginning to start your settlement. \nThere's a really good tutorial video that helped me get into the game. It has seasons and even operates on other details even micro details such as personalized traits for each of the villagers, also informing you when someone is pregnant so you can keep an eye on that person. But as i already mentioned its still not hard to play! Many things also run automatically and at some points I was like \" Oh where did I get this resource from? Thought I have to do everything myself to farm it. Ohwell great!\" And yet its not like the game does everything for you. Overall it has a very nice pace I think because its not too fast so I can play while being relaxed, but also not too slow with something to do all the time :)\nSo just as it mentions in the description next to the video above the game is complexity and yet simplicity including the beautiful artstyle.\nTheres also different difficultylevels you can play on, a map editor if you wanna get creative with designing the world you're gonna play on in the first place and so on and so on....!!\nRECOMMEND!

There are numerous glurges that stayed in the final game because people got used to them. There's some serious inattention to the \"end game.\" Numerous key mechanics function weirdly but go unexplained. \n\nGranted, the dev is *very* responsive and if you google a problem you're having, you're very likely to find a detailed explanation of what went wrong. Unfortunately, the answer is quite often \"oh you played the game wrong; you'll need to start over.\" An example: Farms provide people with food, but if you notice that you're low on food, building a farm will exacerbate the problem, because the farmer AI will take the food from one farm and plant it in the new one, and you won't be able to harvest crops for a couple of months while everyone starves to death. The dev notes that you should really build thee or four farms before you do anything else, otherwise you'll never have enough food. It is now well-known within the game's community that your build-order should have a bunch of farms first thing, and now this problem does not need to be addressed. \n\n(Villager AI causing dumb problems is endemic to town building sims, and even Banished has one degenerative loop you can end up in. But Banished has *one* loop.)\n\nThere's supposed to be a full release soon, and presumably there will be a tutorial or an explanation of some core mechanics that wasn't present in the release I played. Hopefully, that tutorial will make it so that you can play this game and have its elegant systems reveal themselves to you in an organic way, because reading about those systems in a web forum takes a lot of the fun out--it makes the game more like assembling a piece of Ikea furniture than, well, than like playing a game.", "timestamp_created": 1510496776, "timestamp_updated": 1510496776, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.672077", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "36465520": {"recommendationid": "36465520", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996435007", "num_games_owned": 180, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1993, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511528165}, "language": "english", "review": "this is a fantistic game if u like base building, needs more updates to improve lag", "timestamp_created": 1510481016, "timestamp_updated": 1510481016, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.483951", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "36458227": {"recommendationid": "36458227", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037457084", "num_games_owned": 241, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 387, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511777449}, "language": "english", "review": "In the chance that anyone cares to look at a negative review on a Very Positive game, I want to let you know a few reasons why you shouldn't purchase this. Or hold off on playing it for the time being.\n\n1. [strike]The game is hard. Hold up, before you say 'git gud newb', I played on the Casual difficulty, and lost 3 people to starvation, immediatly after, I lost 3 more to dehydration. No matter how many water purifiers you build, no matter how many farms you build, IT WON'T MATTER[/strike] As of the current Uunstable 2 build, if the changes are kept, Food has become manageable due to more spaces in the Farm, and the Farm being upgradeable.\n\n2. And this brings me to point 2, after you lose, 6, crucial, irreplaceable NPCs, you might as well reset the world right there, because you CANNOT make more/recruit more/send more. You have to hope, and pray, that RNG dictates that you will get a pack of Nomads that MAY join you, and that pack ranges from 4-6. Good luck if one or two more NPCs die from Dehydration or Starvation, because now you cannot make up for it, period.\n\n3. The Monsters. The main things that are out for your failure. Why is this a negative point? You only see them if you have  the game on survival, or the one lower. It's a negative point because if you manage to SOMEHOW get past the Dehydration and Starvation epidemic, and you SOMEHOW keep ALL of your NPCs alive, including some nomads, you will meet increasingly stronger monsters as days go on. Their health scales, their damage scales, and most of them go immediatly for your defenses. And, they have damage resistances. And if you try to counter one type of monster, Jokes on you! Because the game is now going to send a different monster, and your defenses won't matter!\n\n4. When I bought this game, I thought to myself, \"This is gonna be a multi village God Sim...Cool! I'll start out with new villagers every time I start a new village.\" I was very wrong. You get a set number of NPCs, for the ENTIRE world. You will NEVER start with new npcs if you go to a different location. I get why they did this, it's so you couldn't farm more villagers to go to your main village, but you have to reset the world everytime that ONE village dies, and you lose ANY resources you collected. This game should be tagged under Rouge-like with how many times you have to restart, and how much stuff you'll lose.\n\n5. [strike]Actual RPG stats. Now look, I agree that villagers should gain skills based up their profession, but what does my lumber jack need Intelligence for? What does my Water master need Strength for? Do these matter? As far as I can tell: No. They level up, but they still take their time collecting things as slowly as possible. To make a comparison of how this actually should matter: In RimWorld, a game I frequent, you set someone to Miner, and the more they mine, the more skill they gain, and the faster the mine, up to a max of 20. These villagers will go past 20 strength and 30 int, and still mine or chop a tree like their stats are 1.[/strike] The Developer explained what the stats do: STR boosts damage, hit points and physical damage resistance, DEX boosts work speed, to hit chance, dodging and movement speed, and INT slightly boosts a bit of everything (and later, will play into more scholarly roles, like learning, or improving skills faster.) But, I do want to flesh them out more when the skill system is added. ;)\n\n6. Essence. I put this as a negative simply because the only 4 powers you will use, is Healing Aura, Holy Golem, Fireball, and Dissolve. There is simply not enough things to do with it. You can throw out a magic-damage only golem...That's neat...And then you can...Occassionally heal your villagers while they are fighting..But they'll still die by Damage over time the zombies put on them....If you're suppose to be God, how come you can't create people? You very clearly can call down fireballs to kill things, so what, is this the god like...a destruction magic only god? Why the healing Aura then? Things just don't make sense, you know?\n\n7. The amount of villagers required to run your buildings. So obviously it's a village management, and like the City builders of old (Pharaoh, Caesar 3, Posiedon and Zues), it requires you to manage workers and where they go. Unlike the city builders of old, the workers required out pace the workers themselves, (Going back to my 1st point.), and you will never have max capacity at any time. Now you don't HAVE to fill these positions, but you will be scratching your head on why does the game recommend to build more then one building, if that building will only require more workers that you don't have to spare.\n\nIs it bad? No, for some, this game will be a blast, but for the average gamer looking to step into new territory? Stay away. You will find yourself quickly dissappointed, and frustrated. But the dev is currently working out details on certain issues and has explained certain things that has made a few points obsolete, and therefore, they are striked out, because they are, in my opinion, resolved at the moment.\n\nComplain Reviews aren't generally enjoyable, but if you agree, I'm glad to see I'm not the only one who thinks this way.\n\nHave a nice day.", "timestamp_created": 1510452430, "timestamp_updated": 1511795994, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 90, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.646680", "comment_count": "55", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "36410827": {"recommendationid": "36410827", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971074685", "num_games_owned": 119, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 8163, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 440, "last_played": 1513911891}, "language": "english", "review": "Great resource gathering, city building, and tower management game.

Survival difficulty is too difficult, and really only because A. the god spells mostly all suck total garbage in mostly every single way, and B. there's not enough structures yet to allow you some nice freedom without being inhibited and handicapped negatively, like by how the second farm type can't feed 125 people, even with literally 9 of them fully staffed.\n\n2. Maps do apparently have a mostly-different difficulty curve associated with each and every one, making it essentially mandatory to start somewhere easy, unless you're just a badanoos at this game, and have the skill to survive in tougher areas without the benefit of just going back to another village to prepare for another try in a seperate, or the same region you'd failed in.\n\n3. Spells such as Holy Golem, Dissolve, Earthquake, and Storm either cost too much to be useful, don't last long enough, or aren't effective enough.\nHoly Golem can't 1v1 a zombie with 250 health if it has 300. This it kinda pathetic, since it's SUPPOSED to be a sort of divine god unit that can help turn a battle. It literally can get killed by 3 headless, since it degens health for some reason, which unequipped villagers can kill without problem.\nDissolve literally will never refund it's cost. It's supposed to remove corpses and resources from the map while giving you mana, or Influence, but it never has ever atleast gained me as much as it costs to cast the spell. However it DOES have a use as clearing corpses into essence for the purpose of fuelling essence collectors.\nEarthquake and Storm take 3/4 of your influence/mana to cast, but neither can even destroy an enemy spawner. It seems like Earthquake should be designed to do this, since it's a large AoE spell with the highest cost, tied with Storm, which seems like a good way to thin a herd of enemies before nightfall, sicne it can easily kill most units instantly, or damn-near instantly.\n\n4. Other spells, like Flame nad Meteor have VERY limited uses that can be on some vague benefit to you at all. Resurrect, which revives dead villagers if you click their ghost during ONLY Dawn or Dusk, which their ghost sometimes just never even appears, say they die in the morning, has a high cost, and roughly a 1/5 chance of just creating a zombie, instead of reviving the dead villager.\nFlame is really only vaguely useful against low-health monsters like Headless, but like I said earlier, literally every can kill then in a 2 headless versus one of anything type of fight. The burning damage effect only affects buildings after 4 casts of this spell, which is less than 1/4 of the mana/influence bar, but the total damage of that many, is just pathetic, even if applied to enemies like Slimes or decent-health zombies.\nMeteor can one-shot most units if they're not inside the hitbox of another unit or building. However they deal a slightly better amount of damage in an aoe, and can burn enemies after 4 casts in one location, but has as much killing power if not more than Earthquake or Storm if you use the entire mana/influence bar.\nBurning damage is OP against your own villagers, so using them to help in battles is utterly pointless, and you'll most likely just kill your own people alongside the enemy, and every single person is needed entirely in Survival difficulty.\n\n5. Monsters will prioritize dogs, gates, buildings, and then villagers usually when attacking at night, maknig Guards almost useless. Guards are also made worse when they equip leather and copper gear instead of iron, vastly limiting their possible effectiveness. Honestly I have literally no idea why monsters even drop leather armor, and copper swords. They're literally worse than iron gear, which you can start making literally as soon as day 4 if you rush for it, which is when monsters start ot appear on the map, while night 5, is when they start to attack and is rather tiny numbers, but by then, you can have a full guard with small amounts of iron gear anyways, so it makes leather/copper gear really quite irrelevant from the very moment you can ever get it, like literally.\n\n6. Worse of all, builders randomly chat with one another, delaying them doing their jobs, which causes builder amounts under 25 or even 20 if you're patient unlike me, to be required, or else it'll take literally all day to complete one single level 1 bow tower. And btw, this chatting happens whenever a building is almost done, but ofcourse every builder who worked on this structure does NOT just go ahead and finish the structure up, but rather, they all WAIT until the last guy comes over to finish the building.\nThis is actually horrifically stupid by every concievable and possible term. It's so stupid, it almost hurts. Builders, should either continually work on a project until it's done, and then maybe chat for ten seconds or so, nothing more, or they should not chat ever and go to other projects until it's time to go home where they'd chat with whomever they share their home with.\nThat, or CHAT DURING WORK LIKE NORMAL PEOPLE WOULD.\n\nThe above 6 things, are all things I really don't like about this game.

However, while this may just seem like a cute little indie game that you'll pick up once then be done with, that was quite the opposite of what I have experienced.\n\n   So to start off, this game a has a HUGE learning curve. You'll probably do ok until winter, only having a couple monsters attack, and a couple people die. That period soon ends. My first play through I was all over, struggled until winter, then died a horrible death. However, through that play through, gave me so much insight onto the game, my second play through went far better.\n\n   The gameplay mechanics are fun, the heat, weather, light mechanics are all well done and provide nice modifiers to the game. The screen can get cluttered at times, but looks fairly clean until mid-late game. I\u2019m a little iffy on the almost micro-management feature where you designate what to harvest, because I kept catching myself not having anything harvested. While being a little annoying at the start, you grow accustomed to it, and helps in the long run. Trying to manage resources was ok, kept getting annoyed that I didn\u2019t have enough workers, boards, cut stones, etc. but I learned. (as I said this game has a HUGE learning curve)\n\n   The defensive mechanics were a little confusing to start, I didn\u2019t know which golems were best, or how many turrets, walls, moats, that I needed. I learned through time, but would appreciate a clear stat sheet. trying to expand without getting horrible destroyed by monsters was fun, and always changing.\n\n   So in conclusion, I would HIGHLY recommend this game. It has its weak points, but that is to be expected with early access. The mechanics were fun, learning how each aspect worked was amazing, and kept me coming back for more. I learned to love the soundtrack, even though it would be playing the most chill music while all of my villagers were getting killed. They have an active discord, which has helped me learn a lot of the mechanics, and how to streamline my game.

These locations differ in available resources and, I think, climate, so choose carefully. (You can found multiple villages in different regions, but you only have a limited pool of villagers, shared between them all.)\n\nAfter you\u2019ve chosen a region the game takes you to the region map, from which you\u2019ll play the game proper. There\u2019s no real tutorial at the moment, but the game gives you some help in the form of pop-up tips. These are a bit lacking, though. For example, I had no food growth and no food, but nothing in any of the tips told me I should build anything until it was too late, and even then I didn\u2019t know the best place to build it. An in-game tutorial would really help; the youtube tutorial video notwithstanding. Still, although you should be able to work out the very basics pretty easily, it\u2019s a steep learning curve when things go wrong and you don\u2019t know why. The Steam Discussions are a useful resource.\n\nAnyway, you choose a section of promising looking land \u2014 water, rocks, trees, and wild food, if you can find it, are all good \u2014 and build a camp. That then lets you build other buildings, too, and before long you\u2019re harvesting resources and growing your camp into a little village community.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1508961926, "timestamp_updated": 1508961926, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "35976875": {"recommendationid": "35976875", "author": {"steamid": "76561198162437200", "num_games_owned": 32, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1218, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509477531}, "language": "french", "review": "this game have a huge future this game is realy good in everything \nthe OST is just beautiful the gameplay is realy  good i rarely see a gameplay like that \na map editor is just so good and simple \nthe difficulty is just right on survival and more easier on traditional and \"darksoul\" mode in nightmare \ni think you can create an history mode about how we come at surviving at monster  more enemies , boss , more upgrade of the castle and other building like curtain wall or even new building like a tower you can put some man to shoot creep , traps . or new job magician, a bartender for people happiness\ncreate a path is hard same for the wall is realy fast to miss click and put the wall above but is easily correct so i don't worry \nis funny the camp is a castle but nobody live inside i think is the specter of the guard who die inside want to be alone ^^\n\nwell i finish with this review i love this game it have the creator souls inside sometime we are sad when a guy you had since the first day die and become a zombie and have to kill it \nother just buy it or you miss a unique game \n\nNOTE 17/20\n\nit have a great future i hope you will continue like that", "timestamp_created": 1508885941, "timestamp_updated": 1508885941, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "35973561": {"recommendationid": "35973561", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023891204", "num_games_owned": 331, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 13505, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 87, "last_played": 1513458603}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is what it says.

As a early access game I give it a 10/10 because it is fun to play already, there are very few bugs, and ongoing development continues to improve game play. Pretty much how a early access game should be. This is a more complete game than many other games that are considered finished by their developers. There has been some discussion about Rise to Ruins leaving early access next year but the dev has assured us that does not mean the end up updates and he actively communicates with the players about ideas and the direction that Rise to Ruin could develop. If you are interested, watch some of the latest videos about it. FallenShogun gaming has a tutorial video for the latest inDev28 build as of this posting. Consider purchasing Rise to Ruins now.

It has its challenges to begin with but it becomes relaxing after a while, unless you don't want it to be.\n\nThis game you are looking at playing is a village sim with a tower defence aspect and some godly powers thrown in. You can use these godly powers as you see fit getting more energy by harvesting the [strike] souls[/strike] essence of those that die eventually getting to a point where you have buildings that collect and store the essence and create it from refined crystal to give you unlimited power! I like creating little stories for those who i see fit to use my power on in my village such as how the others would think when you send one of them to limbo or have a field of  potatos appear before them or a sudden strom appear above their heads, [b] Ill use it in my village if I want to! [/b] They all have their own names and stats as well so you can track them down and bring the ones you like with your godly powers to the new areas and have them help in your dominion of it.\n\nThe buildings have your few typical resource collections such as wood, rock and minerals (iron). These can be refined to let you further expand and upgrade your village. Then you also have to worry about food and water. The changes in season make it so there is a constant need to change how many workers are assigned to these essentials. The constant influx of villagers as well adds to this making it a challenge to get enough food for the winter season, and water for the summer. If you place them in the wrong spot as well it is relatively easy to break them down and move them, but upgrading them back to where to max level can take a little while. Luckily they are still useable even when upgrading.\n\nThen you add the tower defense side to this, basically as long as you have the resources you are free to build the walls and towers how you like and you honestly don't need too much to defend early on but as the monster develop their own little villages (spawns) more attack. The towers are upgradable and the different types of them lets you choose how best you want to set up. Such as forcing monster down a narrow corridor and hitting them with spread damage or creating you own army of golems to fight them off. It is great how they use the different resources as well so you can set up a huge mining, wood or magic facility and use the resources from it to supply those towers with ammo, but it will mean you are stuck with only certain towers.\n\n\n[u] TL:DR: [/u]\n[list]\n[*] A world map that lets you choose the area you want to begin.\n[*] Godly powers to smite those chatter boxes and the monsters that dare defy you or help you villagers get more food and finish work quicker..... I guess..... \n[*] Buildings allow for you to develop slowly and aren't punishing if you make the wrong one just tear it down and get the resources back.\n[*] Tower defense aspect is different and fun, but start with understanding the village side first and aim  to build some golem combulators first is my suggestion, just remember you need an essence collector.\n[*] Even if you mess up you can always just start again, without having to go through much and the maps won't change allowing for you to learn how to start out pretty easily and then getting harder by having you choose what you bring to the new areas from your villages.\n[/list]", "timestamp_created": 1508413239, "timestamp_updated": 1508413271, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523414", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "35835870": {"recommendationid": "35835870", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040757027", "num_games_owned": 144, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 2921, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508934038}, "language": "english", "review": "It's pretty fun to fail and learn from your mistakes in how to defend and build a viable village while under constant seige from the hordes of undead. high replayability value", "timestamp_created": 1508404652, "timestamp_updated": 1508404652, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521343", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "35831005": {"recommendationid": "35831005", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005398847", "num_games_owned": 235, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2670, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511388822}, "language": "english", "review": "In the last two weeks alone, I've sunk almost 9 hours into this game.

"language": "english", "review": "This game is boring as hell. You're basically going to sit watching villagers chop wood for hours and not be able to do anything else because you are unable to expand. \n\nThe reason being is that your population will basically never grow. Villagers won't reproduce unless they're assigned to doing nothing. Plus, after you do make a baby, it takes about three game days for it to grow up and enter the labor force, which turns out is quite a long time. \n\nEvery building requires a dedicated workforce. You start with 40 villagers, so fine. You will have enough free villagers to assign them to work in your first buildings\u2014say, a lumber mill. But the more you build\u2014which you will want to do because you're going to want a population that is well fed and watered and well armed\u2014the more you get spread thin. So then if you lose a villager to fighting zombies, you may well have lost the only person that smelts ore for all you know or who makes arrows for the ballistae.\n\nYou also don't really get nomads adding to your population from the outside. As game events go, notifications of nomads in the area are few and far between. Plus, after day four or so, it's unlikely they'll even be able to make it to your base because there will be so many graveyards and monster spawns on the map that they'll probably be killed en route with nothing you can do about it.\n\nPlus, there's a fairly ungenerous building cap that requires you to continually expand your city center before you can add more buildings. Meaning more waiting and boredom while you watch your dwindling number of villagers chop wood. Your villagers are also very dumb. They will go all the way across town to chop wood instead of chopping the wood you've assigned right next to them/the building you told them to build. Also, don't try and build more than one structure at a time because they are so addlebrained that they will start one structure, get halfway through completing it, then go to the next one and start it until it's halfway done, then go back to the first one. So, more waiting.\n\n\nSo bored.

Dev has really ratcheted up the micro management aspects and it feels more like a chore to play now than fun. I'm still going to keep the recommend, but if it continues to become something with more and more micro management, I don't know that I'll continue playing it.\n\nOriginal Review:\n\nI really enjoy this game. It looks and sounds like it just stepped off the Sega Genesis. It even kinda reminds me of the game Megalomania for that system.\n\nThis is an addictive little city builder/god game/tower defense game hybrid. You spend the majority of your days city building and at night trying to repel mosters with your guards or defensive structures (the tower defense part.) I don't really find myself doing much godhanding until the map has been built up a bit.\n\nMy favorite part of the game is the city building and management. The tower defense portion is decently done, but it's not at all what keeps me interested. (I honestly get a little annoyed at nighttime, because repelling the monsters takes time away from what I'd rather be doing.) I like having to balance my logistical needs against my defensive needs. Hmmm... farm, well or spray tower...? \n\nIf you like city builders or tower defense, this is for you. If you like god games, you'll probably enjoy it as well, even though with me I don't use the god powers much at all, and I'm in year four.\n\n[b]A FEW CRITICISMS (please fix/change):\n\nIf you build a wall diagonally, a lot of times your builders will not build or only partially build the corner wall pieces.\n\nWhen I have one item set to build or upgrade, often builders will mill around with the resource needed to finish it, sometimes dropping it on the ground and walking away.\n\nPlease fix it so that when something is being built and has all the resources but the building isn't at 100% that the builders stay to finish it, instead of doing one or two construction turns on it then walking away. I've waited five minutes for a builder to finsh a structure that had all of the resources but was still waiting at 96% for them to come back.\n\nIf walls don't take up a building slot, why should gates? That's just stupid. I HATE having all the walls built up save a big gaping hole for the gate I can't build because I used the builing slot for something else.\n\nIt would be nice to have a way to make the \"way makers\" auto build paths. Maybe not roads, but at least paths. Often times I completely forget they are even there for an hour at a time, and as such they are just wasted people I could be using on another task. \n\nAND PLEASE... When you get the notifications that nomads come, or that someone died or whatever, make it so you can click on the banner (or below in the chatbox) to see where the heck they are. I've lost multiple full groups of nomads because I can't find them to \"grab\" them. It's much too hard to all the time see them when you're all zoomed out looking, and as the game progresses and gets overrun with monsters, losing more people really hurts. I mean, to be fair, if you're a god you should already know where they are, so something that zooms you there makes sense.[/b]\n\nOtherwise, so far I'm really enjoying it and looking to play more.", "timestamp_created": 1506808636, "timestamp_updated": 1509123267, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "35348590": {"recommendationid": "35348590", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001841569", "num_games_owned": 319, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 1510, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506981579}, "language": "english", "review": "Very solid city-builder/god-game for sure (don't expect currency/research tree, which isn't a problem fyi)\n\nYes, every game of this genre is compared to and held to the standard of RimWorld, but this is no copycat nor a derivative by any stretch.

Like remove the ability to upgrade buildings so you only have makeshift, or remove higher teir walls so only wood, fewer towers, maybe have a demo only map with 1-3 maps and only survival etc. Just to give people an idea of the game.

The game is fun for a few rounds. One/two rounds for learning the basics and the third for trying to survive as long as possible. The game is easy to learn. The game recently got very well optimized and sped up, which is really nice. The game doesn't slow down as much with the current patch. \nThe con's of this game, in my opinion, is the stale need to provide the bare necesities for the villagers to, in a way, start the game. It is the same start up every game. There should be openess to vast combinations of buildings people can try as soon as you start. Some can rush bow towers or rush way-maker, or toolsmith to arm citizens.\n\nI really like this game but it is still satisfactory at best. (If it wants to be not early access.) I constantly revisit the game after an update to see what has changed.\n\nIf you want my opinions to make this game better (more replayable), you need to have even more building materials options, building upgrade options and strategically designed maps with different scarcities. (I really like the weathers btw, it felt more frequent after the update.) In an example scenario a player chooses a map with no rocks and lakes but with plenty of trees. The player builds a well and builds wooden fences, wooden towers, bows, wooden golems, etc. A map can have interactive previews that players can prepare beforehand (like df). Such as \"50% fire element monsters\" and players can build ice towers to counter them, or the map has no rocks so take some rocks or special blue prints to building stone buildings with wood.  A map can have region temperature, which it kind of does by seasons. In my opinion simple changes in maps and options of building materials can dramatically increase the replayabilities. Every game will feel new and different. As of now, the maps seem extremely random drawn meaning some maps have too much open area while others don't. \n\nThe game also need benchmarks and objectives (quests, goals, free steam icons). These are things imo very simple to accomplish and motivate players to play more. I would also like multiplayer and online play but these things are too far fetched and unnecessary.\n\nThe recent update with the marketplace, more frequent nomads, and treasure boxes tried to make the game feel fun and new but didn't really address the replayability issues. I think it simply made the game alot easier. The optimization improved alot I think I surpassed 128 population w/ at least 60 golems w/o issues. Started slowing down during the night time after 170 population and 70+ golems. Previsously I couldn't play past 80/90 population. (Props to you developers!)

At around day 10 I started to take a closer look on defenses, and started building some defense towers. There are tons of defensive buildings compared to the regular buildings, but that\u2019s ok. When monsters arrived at day 15 it was quite easy to handle at first, but within a very short time, they arrived in HORDES. Especially the spectres are dangerous, the others are merely lining up at the walls trying to get through, ready to get pierced by my towers. Only the spectres can walk through the walls, attacking towers or people within my walls.\nDuring nighttime, when the monster waves move towards the town, I try to grab as many spectres and place them far far away on the map to reduce the risk of getting overrun. At the same time, I try to grab my golems to drop them near a building that heals them. So, during night it\u2019s a bit stressful to make sure not to get overrun.\n\nWhile realizing that this is more a tower-defense style game is not that bad, the fact that you cannot control your villagers is a bit disappointing. Somewhere I read 'like populous should have been' - yeah, back in the days of that classic you had control over a 'hero' or 'leader' that you could send towards the enemy population. That game needs that too - urgently!\nThere is no way  (that I know of at the moment) to reduce the immense number of monster-spawns on my map (iirc I did not change the numbers for monster spawns when I started my custom game), so that I could, for example, clean a bit of the map from monster-spawns to make the nights a bit calmer ...\n\nAlso, the game really needs the possibility to define resource-importance for the organizers (think of the poor guys in 'settlers' carrying stuff from flag to flag), as well as the possibilities to tell my production facilities how long or how much to produce from any resource somehow.\nYeah, that would be some sort of village builder then, and move away from a god-sim, but it is a bit depressing to see that whole forests lie around chopped down, while there is no place to store the wood, or that I have 15 shovels and other tools in stock - I can turn on/off buildings and assign villagers to their jobs, so I hope that this will be implemented - some control over your 'industry'\n\nAlso, being a godlike, I\u2019d wish for forming the terrain a bit - rising lowering for example\n\nAlso, there\u2019s currently not much use in the list of buildings or villagers - but I hope that you might use it to jump to the particular building, or villager via this list - would be useful\n\n\nSo, what now? Recommend it or not?\nI'd say, \"Definitely yes\" if you think that dwarf fortress is a bit too rough for you.\nIt\u2019s a solid nice piece of game!\n", "timestamp_created": 1504420066, "timestamp_updated": 1504420066, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.580307", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34703462": {"recommendationid": "34703462", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022526578", "num_games_owned": 116, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 264, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504417247}, "language": "brazilian", "review": ".", "timestamp_created": 1504418022, "timestamp_updated": 1504418022, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34679925": {"recommendationid": "34679925", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989595380", "num_games_owned": 543, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 4612, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504785185}, "language": "english", "review": "Outstanding.

I know indie devs fear negative reviews like the plague, but it's still nice to get instant help. But seeing that the game was released into EA in october 2014, it kinda left me with a feeling that the dev is more concerned about the negative reviews than finishing the game. Now I just bought the game and haven't been observing the pace of the development, so I might be completely off with that (and I hope I am). I also took a quick glance at the steam forums and it seemed like the dev was actually active there too (which is surprisingly rare).\n\n\nThoughts about the actual gameplay after 10 hours:\n\n+The pace of the game seems good. Doesn't require reflexes like a RTS would, but also doesn't make you just sit and wait too much.\n+In general it shows potential and implies that it has depth and replay value.\n+For the most part the UI is clear and easy to use.\n\n+-The lack of in-game tutorial. There is a button for \"Watch a tutorial video\" and the game gives you some general tips along the way, but they help very little.\n\n-The game offers too little information about things like how many buidlings you need to have in order to have your town survive (farms for food, wells or rain catchers for water etc).\n-The time for pixel graphics has come and gone. It actually gets extremely blurry if you zoom in even a little bit (why does it even allow you to do this?).\n-The villagers' AI is sometimes bugged and not knowing what their priority is in performing different tasks takes a lot of the fun out of the game.\n-Some of the buttons on the UI (assigning villagers to different buildings for example) are WAY too small, considering the next point.\n-The mouse pointer moves like it's on a rubber band. The delay ain't that bad, but just enough that it actually gets really annoying to try and aim at some of the smaller buttons.\n\nIt's these last two points that made my review negative. Feels like something that wouldn't bother a normal person, but some of the buttons are really small and the rubber banding mouse ain't helping.\n\nAnd in case anyone gets to read this before the fanboys downvote this into oblivion (as they do to all negative reviews): I'm not saying not to buy it.

Build walls to funnel the monsters through them.  \n\nIt will be a real challenge and unlike Banished, there is a real risk. \n\nMoreover, there's a world map with multiple locations to build villages.

While it's not perfect, there is a charm and love in the game that makes me want to keep it installed and play a bit every update.\n\n\tThe music and pace of the game play can be very relaxing. While it can be very challenging to try and get the village up and running with the pressure of monsters trying to ruin all your hard work, the game itself has a very strong ant-farm feel. The villagers just do their things with little to no intervention from you; assign jobs and build or harvest orders, watch them scurry around to take care of the village. It can almost be therapeutic to just zoom out and watch them move about while listening to the music.\n\tIt is a god game, so there is a bit of messing around. Between god powers, sandbox mode, and custom difficulties, I have enjoyed a fair amount of just screwing off and either toying with my villagers or breaking the game engine by testing special tower and maze arrangements then spawning more mobs than my computer could handle.\n\n\tAdmittedly, this game will not have a universal appeal. As of right now, there isn't any designated objective or overarching goal involving the world map. The players will have to decide what they are in for: take over a map and safely grow a village as large as they can, fight off hordes of enemies in harder difficulties, or try and populate all parts of the world map with sustainable villages. If you don't think you can sorta make your own goals through things like this or the custom difficulty options, you may want to watch and wait. Content is constantly being worked on, so there may be something that appeals more to you later on.\n\t\n\tFor those of you wary of Early Access, there is something to be said about the developer; while this is by no means unique, Rayvolution is very active with the community and passionate about the game. I've been on the Rise to Ruin Discord server (you can find a link in the main menu of the game) and have enjoyed conversation with him and other players immensely. I have faith that Rayvolution will see the game continue to grow in quality and content, and not leave RtR in Early Access hell. If you are interested in the game, but don't want to buy it, I'd highly recommend you chat with him and the other fans there.", "timestamp_created": 1499711899, "timestamp_updated": 1499711899, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33436043": {"recommendationid": "33436043", "author": {"steamid": "76561198098689326", "num_games_owned": 41, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 74, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499698371}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is simply useless until it will fully operable on a pause, like other smart games like Dwarf Fortress, Banished or Rimworld.\nPause -> gather information -> decision-making -> actions -> unpause -> view for results.\n\nNow all interface is locked at the time of a pause and there remains a simple 'online something-craft' or other 'click-per-minute' shitty RTS.\nPretty stupid.\n\nI hope, the author will correct this most vivid and ridiculous defect and I immediately change my mind about this game.\n\nPlayed more than 20 hours from another account, but could not write for another person.\nNo, I do not have problems with the complexity and interface.\nIt is absurd to believe that after such a game as Dwarf Fortress, a person will frighten away of complexity.\n\nAnd this game is much more like Dwarf Fortress. If you add spells and limbo, this does not mean that it will change the core mechanics - indirect control real time strategy.\n\nSo, in general the genre isn't even important for me. RPG, strategy, simulations... wherever there is an action in one time and where the speed of mouseclicks can change the result - I will strongly against the 'cpm principe'.\nThe buildings are not built instantly - you give the order, which can be done on a pause.\nChanges settings of buildings, marking on the map, other orders, etc - all this is possible.\nThere are good examples of spell casting on pause - you just \"draw\" what you want to do on a pause, and then it happens, even if you are already looking elsewhere.\nAnd with the grabbing people - it's even ridiculous. Do I have to scroll the map in real time?

For $5 on sale or $10 full price you get more than your moneys worth from this combination RTS/City Builder/Tower Defense/Survival/Godlike simulator. Yes, that is a lot of hats for one game to wear but these roles are weaved together quite seamlessly that none of them seem forced. \n\nThe main gameplay is city builder in nature, assign your villagers jobs, give them building and gathering tasks to complete and watch your little lemmings go. (And for the love of god get some Water Masters. Half the complaints on the forums are people who don't understand the importance of this occupation) The survival aspect balancing water/food intake and consumption of your villagers, assuring housing for them,  while still attempting to grow your little village with new buildings and tech is made more difficult by the nightly attacks from enemies. This daily, timered invasion is what makes up the TD aspect of the game, and creating intricate mazes for the brain dead enemies to mindlessly walk through while getting pelted by the slings and arrows from your towers is a requisite for surivial. Build too many civilian building and neglect your defense at your peril. \n\nFinally, you also get magic spells to cast at your lesiure, using up magical energy that you can replenish by harvesting the BLOOD OF YOUR ENEMIES. Fireballs, earthquakes, healing auras, rainstorms (remember how important water is?) and other delicacies await your succulent mouseclicks in the buffet of icons atop your screen.\n\nDouble finally, the developer is very active and constantly in contact with the communicty and incorporating new ideas and updates.

And thoses choices apply for everything: wood/ water/stone/crystals ressources, defense against enemies, health care etc...\n\nNegative one:\nI do think the \"tower defense\" aspect to be a bit limiting as way of defence and also breaking realism.\nNot in a very bad way tho, tower defense in this game is fun, but while your villagers can defend themselves to a certain extend against sparse monsters, after some days it's no longer a viable way at all, and you need to place towers and make a labyrinth out of walls to be able to survive (there are several level of difficulties mind you, so there may be a sweet spot between the tower-defense and the totally peacefull mode.)\nBUT:\nNext update will provide the ability to create patrols, sparring between citizen, watchtowers, and guard houses for them and their equipement, so it may become a viable way to defend your town the dwarf-fortress way (with your own citizens, trained for combat). \n\nI'm really eager to see what the next update will bring, as this game really feel promising!\nAnd, please forgive my broken engrish, I'm french, and curently trying hard to improve my english.", "timestamp_created": 1498927459, "timestamp_updated": 1498930270, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33085423": {"recommendationid": "33085423", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003433801", "num_games_owned": 328, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 940, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 231, "last_played": 1514310034}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Una grata sorpresa entre tanto juego.

In addition the game is already fully capable of being played i have to say that known companies release games that are less complete. *cough* SC2 and anno *cough* \n\nAs for the game:\nthe difficulty is a little out of pitch... i have been running multiple maps on nightmare to year 4 and beyond and i can say that after surviving the first year its almost impossible to screw up unless you leave the game running over night and your villagers do somethign dumb.

There's as much variability as you could reasonably want, between the maps, the weather, and the variable monster spawns. So yeah. Make a town, gather food and water, and build up walls and towers.

It's fun, entertaining, and has more depth than you might suspect. The art style is simple and clean. Game play is simple to learn while offering great challenge.\n\nResource management is efficient: Wood, Stone, Food, and Crystals are the basic four to be gathered from the map. They can each be refined into secondary, advanced resources.\n\nYour citizens are not directly managed other than being able to pick them up and move them around. They operate by AI based on how you manage your village development. This saves a lot of click and drag that bogs down other titles. It was a great design choice. Citizens also level up based on their work, becoming more efficient and stronger over time.\n\nYour village succeeds or fails based on your method of developing it, and defending it. Monsters will start attacking your village within a few days of starting it. The game brings in aspects of RTS games and Tower Defense as your primary combat systems. Much of your defense is managed by tower construction and building obstacles to slow the advance of attacking nasties.\n\nThe game can be played in settings from Sandbox mode to Nightmare mode, meaning from \"no monsters\" to \"Do you feel lucky, punk?\" The hardest level can pose a challenge to the most advanced village-building gamer.\n\nThe game is not complete, but updates are frequent. The developer is present on the Steam forums and hosts Twitch streams to keep players up to date with development. He's also very interactive with the player base and open to new ideas. This is the kind of developer who keeps improving the game and providing new content on a regular basis. Check in on his streams, you'll like the guy and his video-bombing cat.\n\nI give this game a 10/10 because it's great as is, getting better all the time, and the developer is a fantastic example of how to conduct business when creating a game.", "timestamp_created": 1497899309, "timestamp_updated": 1497899309, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.654088", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "32563975": {"recommendationid": "32563975", "author": {"steamid": "76561198386780546", "num_games_owned": 23, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 281, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 58, "last_played": 1513520181}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u666e\u901a", "timestamp_created": 1497874497, "timestamp_updated": 1497874497, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.186749", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "32560706": {"recommendationid": "32560706", "author": {"steamid": "76561197968656725", "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2464, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498943111}, "language": "english", "review": "Mad addicitive.

Despite it being out a while on EA I had never seen/heard of this title. Maybe because I avoid EA for the most part considering all the scams. This is however quite amazing. The developer is very active and always has been and seems to motivated by all the right things. On to the game. It's obvious comparison would be RimWorld. And though RimWorld has a bit more distinct and upgraaded graphics, I actually didn't have near as much \"hooked\" fun as I have with this one. Not often I pull a 4+ hour stretch in the \"trying out\" session. The Mechanics and mixed genre of this game far outreaches Rimworld and though RimW may be more asthically pleasing graphically it falls flat when compared to this title in actual gameplay. There arem many different modes + a map editor for your own designs.\n\nThe game is still in aplpha and the devs updates very frequently with lots of features to come down the line. Even at full rpice I would be very pleased and satisified, it pretty interesting that the game can provide so much fun with lots of features still not implemented yet even as it is currently is content was very pleasing. I had no tech problems, ran smooth and though some things can be tweaks, and probably will be, they didn't hamper my enjoyment very much. I ant ell already this will rise quickly in the \"playtime\" list of my games and I'm certainyl looking forward to refinements both in gameplay and graphics but as I'll repeat, even as it sits now it's a massively entertaing game, and pretty surprising for a title still in EA. Hopefully, like some of the really great successes like Prison Arcitect, Planetbase and a few others I took a risk on, that both used EA properly and delievered in the end, this will be a trully amazing game in the end.

The developer steadily brings out updates with brand new content, with a massive \"defence\" patch (2nd June 2017), allowing upgrades of defence positions, in addition to all the other upgradeable buildings.\n\nThe visuals are crisp and satisfying to look at, with everything from colors and shape of everything falling properly into place, and several varieties of every tile-set, apart from water. There is a world map where you can choose any map to visit to look at this variation; blue forests to ashen sands, and marble mountains to blackstone.\n\nAfter choosing a map on the world screen, you start off the game on an uninhabited map, prompting you to place your village center where you want it to be. Taking a close look at the map for a minute or two can make things much harder or easier depending on location. Shortly afterwards you start to notice the myriads of buildings at your disposal, and work you have to do in order to survive; it might be overwhelming at first, but it really is quite simple once you get going:\n- Select resources for collection.\n- Build stuff you need: Collection buildings for wood/stone etc, production, defences, refining, etc etc.\n- Don't die!\n- Repeat.\nYou cannot control villagers directly, however. They will do the jobs that are given to them via the resources you select and the job list UI on the left side of the screen. This is somewhat a weak point, as the control you have is extremely low. I would like to have something of a flag system; where you can place flags at certain locations that works like additional orders to your villagers. Like flags for avoiding areas, prioritizing resource collection at a certain area so you don't have to reassign those orders all the time. or even attacking an area. The Avoid Area flag would be great, as villager AI is very bad when they fight monsters, often dying for no reason when they could run away into their houses to heal. The AI is the game's biggest weakness, but really is not a big issue.\n\nThe gameplay is affected by several factors. Weather and seasons play a huge role. If it's windy and rainy, your villagers gets slowed down significantly. It does not rain in the winter and nothing grows, and in the summer villagers drink more water and heat up frequently. It's a lot to take into consideration. Luckily, you have several spells to use! Your spell points regenerate over time and from particles floating around the map after something has died, and can be spent to cast storms, picking things up, quickly growing nature stuff, healing and more. Be careful where you cast that fireball though!\n\n\nYou are probably gonna fail spectacularly the first times around, unless you picked the easiest difficulties at the world screen.  Either way it's a good time, and really satisfying to build your favorite village. The game is very cheap for what you get for it, the replayability is immense, and increased by several magnitudes by the map editor and ability to share maps over the workshop.

It is implemented by requiring the city center to get upgraded, and each subsequent upgrade requires new materials that must be manufactured. Great design and I thoroughly enjoy the amount of decision-making generated by the mechanic. Each new building consumes a \"building slot\".\n\nThis game is sort of a combo: tower defense and city building are the main mechanic. But the game also adds a god spell-casting mechanism, which allows casting fireballs, earthquakes, holy golems, healing aura, resurrect the ghost, and a few others, all with varying essence costs, which is slowly building up over time according to how happy villagers are.\n\nMost importantly, there is a \"grab anything\" spell that allows grabbing enemies, friends, resources -- just not buildings. You can use it to move enemies away if they are causing too much trouble, or saving your villagers before certain death, or collecting resources your villagers aren't collecting fast enough. Each time you use it it burns essence depending on how long you grab something. This has the side-effect of making game-pause disallow touching the board in any way (pause also won't let you use the building-selection menus, but the dev claims he will change this eventually). Not being able to change a paused board I find annoying, especially when it's only reason is to support a strange game-play mechanism. The game develops an arcade-like feel (i.e. frantically moving things around), when it's supposed to be a city-builder. It's odd.  [Most city builders involve dropping \"blueprints\" that workers eventually build the buidings on top of - but this is the first city builder I have seen that won't let you pause and place as many blueprints as you like - you have to unpause the game to do that.]\n\nAnother odd mechanism is that the global map (where you choose the submap the village will be placed in) can have units (enemy or ally) in \"limbo\", and they can be portalled out of a map or back in as you like. I scratch my head at why this was put in - but there it is.\n\n\nBut wait! There's more! There are also 2 other mini-games: - collect the essence and - find the friend or foe. \n\nCollect The Essence\n\nCollect the essence involves moving your mouse around essence that results from enemy deaths or other triggers that have it free-floating in the atmosphere. The way the essence follows bezier curves is fun to watch and it's a bit relaxing break from the rest of the game.\n\nFind The Friend Or Foe\n\nThe other minigame \"find the friend or foe\" involves hovering the mouse close enough to ground units to see whether they are enemies or friends (your own villagers or nomads). If you don't have your mouse close enough, you can't see what they are. This I think was a really bad UI choice for the sake of creating a mini-game. I find it purely annoying. Your mileage may vary.\n\n\nConclusion\n\nThe game involves several mini-games, some add and some detract from the core gameplay, which is castle (or city) building. Because this is still early access, who knows? But I feel I've already gotten my money's worth purely for the mechanisms I like, and it's very easy to keep playing this until the late hours of the night.

Now I can't say everyone will enjoy it. Especially since you are basically guarenteed to lose your first few games. However, the reason why you lose, often times will not be the same. I've lost due to starvation, dehydration, lack of defences, overbuilding, stupid lightning storms (this problem was actually solved in a recent update) random monsters appearing in areas I didn't check, random monsters breaking in because my own towers betrayed me by destroying the terrain, and just plain being overran by slimes and zombies. This is one of those games that will cause you to be like, okay, I lost because of this, what can I do to live longer? And this will haunt you till you finally last longer than one year in game. Even then, maybe another year. \n\nAfter that.....I'm sorry, Ray (the developer), there's no real end game. Not yet anyways. Although, for you random people reading this, this game is updated literally every month or two. Opt into unstable releases and you can play a new update roughly every two to three weeks. \n\nAlso for you complete and total over-achievers, you should try to conquer the map by building fire pits all over it. And then, strip mine it and deforest the land. By this point.....not going to lie, you just spent an entire day or two in the real world questioning, just what did you even do with your life? \n\nI swear, every update I spend like 8 hours testing out the new content. I only recently managed to shrink this time by using cheat engine. Which I completely and thoroughly recommend you do. Not because of cheating (which I haven't figured out how to do yet nor feel the need to do) but because there isn't a time warping ability yet. Simply enable the speed hack and you've shrunk the time from 8 hours to 4. Possibly even 3. Well.....I say this, but somehow I still end up playing for 8 hours even though I had it sped up by three times, two when my town got large enough. \n\nRight, I should talk about your giant floating hand. It floats. Picks up stuff, given that you have enough influence/essence. Other abilities include launching fireballs from heaven, calling lighting storms to bring rain, and really horrifying lighting (picture having a wall with a large of amount of zombies on the other side of it, then picture said wall getting blown up by lightning. Begin to cry because you've just been overrun by zombies.) call an earthquake that is equally terrifying, call a holy golem which needs a serious buff because it's far more expensive than what it could be used for, regrow entire forests and large amounts of food (which while they may say they are different vegetables, they are really and honestly carrots with different colors), banish your enemies, recall all resources, nomads, and stray villagers to your town center, warp things in and out of limbo (your global map storage), and even disolve any and all living and once living things for more essence. Oh, did I mention your villagers tend to freak out by your hand? \n\nMost importantly, you will fail, and that is okay.

For example, when the mouse is positioned over the menu I want to be able to use the scroll wheel to go up and down, not having to click the arrows. (I'm sure this will be fixed in the future!)\n-End game loses the \"oh no I can't leave my computer feel\" \n-----after the base is set up and you have a decent power generation you don't have to worry about monsters a whole lot as your towers do so much damage. I think I have 4 ballistas and they take out any strong monsters before they reach me.\n-My villagers eat turnips.. only..\n---- I would love to see some more variety in food resources and ways to gather them in the future!

Simple army management, so the player can occasionally send an excursion against the enemy camps, to reduce their ever increasing numbers.\n\n2.

The videos and previews of the game are VERY different from the current state of the game. It is no longer the brutal survival simulator that I saw on youtube and on steam. Monsters are very nonaggresive and doctile preferring to stay near their nests and wander around doing nothing. During night time very few monsters bother coming over to destroy my village. And the fights are definitely not as thrilling as the videos made them out to be. There's just one monster with crazy amounts of HP instead of multiple monsters with smaller amounts of HP. This change made the game very...bland. The tower defense aspect of the game isn't very exciting either. Due to the constant restraints of the \"building limit\" you have to keep upgrading your homebase in order to build more towers. And after you get \"permission\" from the ministry of labours your building sites are constantly blocked by tree \"stumps\". When you mine a resource like a tree or a rock for example they leave behind a little \"stump\" that blocks any construction on where the resource used to be. Now I think I understand why this was implimented. It was probably implemented to \"protect\" the player from over harvesting resources so that way they always have a \"stump\" to go back to for more wood, crystals, food etc. What I find troubling about this philosophy is that it is counter intuitive of the philosophy of the game. What I thought the game was about was SURVIVAL, not the forever sand box. The problem with this is two fold: one there already is a survival and sandbox modes so the over arching \"protection\" from the devs to prevent overharvesting goes beyond what the modes imply; players are being handheld in survival mode and it feels...boring. The second problem is that there is no \"end game\" for sandbox right now (neither for survival) so it doesn't matter.\n\nOver all I thought this game was going to be breakneck difficulty like dwarffortress, but instead it was a hand-holding, carebear boredom. I like difficulty and I found none here. I was so bored I left my base to run for a couple of real life hours without me and when I came back it was just fine (except for a few people gone missing).\n\nIf you wanted a care-bear experience with mild tower defense you found the game.

Starting with a small village, barely defending it, and then finishing it off with advanced technology is an enjoyable cycle to play through each game. At the moment, the game is well worth $10. With more content, it could certainly reach up to a $20-$25 value game.\n\nTwo SMALL concerns though:\n1. Expanding your town across the entire map is difficult, if not impossible. This is probably a mechanic to ensure there's always enemies to fight on the map, but more expansion (maybe half map?) would be more satisfying.\n\n2. The problems your village is facing should probably be a little more pronounced than an openable window in the top of the screen. It is noticably better than to be spammed with \"YOUR VILLAGE IS DYING\" every 10 seconds, but an occasional icon change or flash would help me before my entire village thirsts to death.\n\nWhat I'd like to see (don't know what the dev is planning):\n1. Simple army management, so the player can occasionally send an excursion against the enemy or keep a standing army at the walls.\n\n2. Unique resources for story mode maps + trading of these resources among your many towns. To give some more feeling of progression.\n\n3. More late game buildings and towers.

This made me post a negtive review hoping it will grab someones attention (yep, not the fairest way to deal with an indi dev but still better than refund).\nI'm glad I get a very fast response asking for the bug. Which made me re-install the game... which now just starts normally (damn, sometimes you need to uninstall and re-install the game to fix it) so I cant recreate the bug but I'm happy the game is running normally now.\nThe game is definitey proissing with lots of options in it. The UI is not the friendliest one but the tutorial popups are quite helpful and you don't feel lost with so many controls.\nSo my first encounter with the game was harsh but once I manage to start it I like what I see and feel and it is promissing even more.\nThis is a first impression comment (not a real review) and I will add my real one after I put some more hours in the game - for now just wnated to change my recommendation to positive while also warnig of this potential bug I have experienced.", "timestamp_created": 1491830976, "timestamp_updated": 1491853314, "voted_up": true,

I say its a good game, in weird mixture of god game and tower defence though with limited towers which I dont mind since it is an early access game and they frequently update it.\n\nMy major issue with this game is, once you hit the mark of 250+ villagers, god dang the fps just drops or freezes specially during the night time with the hoardes of zombies coming to the villages. And I couldn't do anything because of the lag. I mean the fps dropped even before 250 but it was still playable/managable so I was cool with that. But now it's got the point that even when i try to load the village it takes a long time and its kinda of unable now. Just really annoying.\n\nI have other minor issues:\n- The frozen water thing doesnt make sense, my villagers died of dehydration instead of starvation during winter. Like shouldnt you be able to get water from frozen lakes..? This one is dumb issue beause I guess I am trying to find logic in a game. idk you can ignore this one.\n- The sending resource/villagers to the Limbo influence points is a bit expensive. When you have a mass population and you want to reduce it but sending them to limbo quiet isn't too helpful since the points doesnt generated fast enough to compete with people moving in and birth rate.\n- The storages could do with a bit more space.

The version reviewed was InDev25d.\n\nRise to Ruins is a village simulator with some god game elements, from indie developer Raymond Doerr. It was previously titled Retro-Pixel Castles.\n\nIn Rise to Ruins, you're given a group of settlers with whom you have to found a village and survive for as long as possible. Like most games of this type, there's no real end goal -- or at least none that I'm aware of -- instead you tend to play until your village is wiped out (or nearly so) and then you start again and try to do better next time. The game includes seasonal climate changes and a day/night cycle, both of which present further complications and challenges, but which are great additions to the game.\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\nThe game is played from a top-down overhead view, with characters (people and monsters) drawn from a three-quarter perspective to give them a bit more personality. You can adjust the zoom from a functional-but-not-quite-far-enough minimum, allowing you to see a fair bit of the surrounding area, up to a chunky-pixel maximum, where a single villager takes up a fair portion of the screen. At minimum zoom the game looks quite nice, with map tiles being well drawn, and characters looking like colourful ants. At maximum zoom the characters look a bit too blocky for my liking.\n\nThere are no real graphics detail settings, though there are particle and shadow settings, and the obligatory windowed/full-screen options. (ProTip: Don't play in full screen; it's very buggy.) It's not a graphics-heavy game by any means, but it chugs along nicely even with a hundred or so villagers all going about their business.\n\n[h1]Sound[/h1]\nMusic has a nice fantasy/mediaeval theme that suits the game well in my opinion. Sound effects are functional, but nothing special.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nRise to Ruins begins with an overhead map of the game's continent, from which you select a region in which you want to settle your first village. These locations differ in available resources and, I think, climate, so choose carefully. (You can found multiple villages in different regions, but you only have a limited pool of villagers, shared between them all.)\n\nAfter you've chosen a region the game takes you to the region map, from which you'll play the game proper. There's no real tutorial at the moment, but the game gives you some help in the form of pop-up tips. These are a bit lacking, though. For example, I had no food growth and no food, but nothing in any of the tips told me I should build anything until it was too late, and even then I didn't know the best place to build it. An in-game tutorial would really help; the youtube tutorial video notwithstanding. Still, although you should be able to work out the very basics pretty easily, it's a steep learning curve when things go wrong and you don't know why. The Steam Discussions are a useful resource.\n\nAnyway, you choose a section of promising looking land -- water, rocks, trees, and wild food, if you can find it, are all good -- and build a camp. That then lets you build other buildings, too, and before long you're harvesting resources and growing your camp into a little village community.\n\nAs is common to many god games, you don't have any direct control over your people; you can assign them to tasks -- builder is the only one available to begin with, but as you build more buildings, more jobs become available -- and that's about it. To harvest resources you select and highlight them on the map, and your people are supposed to harvest as many as they need, and no more.\n\nYou very quickly need to build up some basic infrastructure, including housing, food growth, water processing, and some rudimentary defences, the latter being required because you never know when a wandering monster might wander into your village and start attacking your people. Combat seems to be stacked against you, too; you don't have any really good 'troops' of your own, and the tower-defence style of defence doesn't quite seem to work: monsters bash through walls rather than being funnelled to your 'kill zone', and it's sometimes hard to even notice them in the first place, with no ability to automatically focus on important events.\n\nYou also have a small collection of god powers, which you can use by spending your collected essence: another resource, but one that's harvested by you rather than your people. I was a little disappointed in these, as I'd been hoping for a bit more range and depth to them, but what's there is useful and well thought out. I guess it would be fair to say they're more like Populous than Populous II.\n\nRise to Ruins has been in Early Access for about two-and-a-half years, so you'd be forgiven for worrying that it had been abandoned. It definitely hasn't, though: the developer releases regular updates and is active in the Steam Community for the game. As you'd expect from an EA title, though, Rise to Ruins does have some bugs. My first hour with the game consisted of about 15 minutes of playtime, followed by 45 minutes of trying to recover from a crash. The game just wouldn't restart and instead sat there spinning Windows' blue wheel of doom until I killed it. I eventually manually edited the settings and turned off full-screen mode and after that it worked again.\n\nYou'll encounter minor issues, too. Even with many idle people I found that building would often stop due to no resources being available, so the automatic resource harvesting seems to need a bit of adjustment. The UI is a bit wonky and controls aren't what I would choose, either, but they're functional, and the developer has stated that he reworks the UI every now and then, so what's here now may not be here forever. There's a big message reminding you to press the middle mouse button to cancel whenever you're in the middle of an action, such as designating resources or using god powers; it's lucky it's there, since middle mouse button to cancel is not intuitive at all.\n\n[h1]PROS AND CONS[/h1]\nPros:\n+ Detailed and in-depth simulation; there's a lot to learn\n+ Different game modes from casual and explorative (sandbox) to VERY challenging (survival)\n+ Solid design with a dedicated developer\n+ Nice music, nice graphics at lower zoom levels\n\nCons:\n- No proper tutorial, making for a very steep learning curve\n- Some bad bugs, especially in full screen\n- Some awkward controls\n- Combat isn't that great\n\n[h1]CONCLUSION[/h1]\nI've only just begun to learn some of Rise to Ruin's intricacies, but I can see there's a lot here.

It is HARD to get some food, Farmers do tend the Farm and harvesting food from the environment is easy but it's not enough, after having enough food for 40+ people it would not last for maybe 2-3 days and the farmers are mostly just standing there after doing their job, and the lack of food just enough to feed your people would be even worst at winter where there is no harvest at all.

Die Mischung aus Aufbaustrategie, Dorfsimulation (mit Survivalelementen) und Tower-Defence hat mich positiv \u00fcberrascht. Es ist sehr gut aufeinander abgestimmt und was mir sehr wichtig ist, keiner der Aspekte dominiert. Diese Mischung macht das Spiel einzigartig.\n\nSpielmechanik:\nBei Early Accress (kurz: EA) Spielen bin ich bei dieser Wertung sehr zur\u00fcckhaltend. Normalerweise funktioniert dies oder jenes noch nicht so gut, so dass es eigentlich Punktabz\u00fcge geben m\u00fcsste. Nicht bei Rise to Ruins, denn auch wenn es sich um ein EA Spiel handelt, so haben alle Spielmechaniken, Buttons und Prinzipien funktioniert. Einzig die Steuerung und Menu-Anordnung m\u00fcsste noch einmal etwas verbessert werden. \n\nGrafik: \nSchaut euch selbst die wundersch\u00f6nen Bilder an. Die Grafik wird mit sehr sch\u00f6nen Animationen und Effekten untermalen. Das Gesamtbild ist stimmig und die Welt wird sehr sch\u00f6n dargestellt. Dies ist vor allem an so kleinen aber wichtigen Details wie, dass wenn es regnet der Regen auf von den D\u00e4chern f\u00e4llt, bzw sich Pf\u00fczten bilden, zu merken.\n\nSound:\nDer Sound ist an sich stimmig, aber ich finde hier ginge noch mehr. Aber es ist ein Beschweren auf hohem Niveau. \u00c4hnlich wie bei der Grafik wurde hier teilweise sehr an den Details gefeilt. Bspw. wenn es Blitzt ist es auch nach jeweiliger Kameraposition dort der Ton zu h\u00f6ren/bzw. lauter zu h\u00f6ren. Gegenden wie W\u00e4lder, Wiesen oder Gebirge haben leider kein eigene Sounds.\n\nGameplay:\nDas wichtigste Vorweg: Man muss sich daran gew\u00f6hnen, dass man verliert. Egal wie gut ich bin, irgendwann werden die Monster zu viele und/oder zu stark. Aber genau hier liegt die St\u00e4rke des Spiels. Man verbessert sich mit jedem Durchgang ein wenig, so dass man noch einen Tag l\u00e4nger \u00fcberlebt. Und dabei ist das Spiel durchaus sehr fair! \n\nEinziger wirklicher Kritikpunkt am Gameplay ist das \"Limbosystem\". Bei Beginn des Spiels holt man sich seine Einwohner und ersten Ressourcen aus dem \"Limbo\". Man kann als Spieler Ressourcen und Einwohner auch wieder in den \"Limbo\" schicken, kostet aber Einfluss. Man kann aber auch Ressourcen und Einwohner w\u00e4hrend des Spiels aus dem \"Limbo\" holen. Bei einem weiteren Durchgang in der Welt, nimmt man die verbleibenden Ressourcen und Einwohner des \"Limbo\". Wenn es zu wenige sind kann man keine neue Siedlung gr\u00fcnden und muss die Welt \"reseten\".\nMir pers\u00f6nlich w\u00fcrde es besser gefallen, wenn man jedes mal mit exakt dem selben Ressourcen und Einwohnern anfangen w\u00fcrde, statt sich f\u00fcr die kommende male evtl. immer st\u00e4rker zu machen.\n\nSupport/Zukunft:\nEs wird aktiv am Spiel entwickelt und die Updates kommen regelm\u00e4\u00dfig. Kritik und Ideen werden aufgenommen, genauso wie Bugs gefixt. Mit dem letzten gro\u00dfen Update kam auch noch ein weiteres gro\u00dfes Feature in das Spiel. \nIch sehe bei diesem Spiel, wenn der Entwickler so dran bleibt, eine rosige Zukunft mit steigenden Verkaufszahlen.\n\n\nFazit: \nIch finde den Preis f\u00fcr dieses sehr spa\u00dfige, herausfordernde aber/und auch s\u00fcchtig machende Spiel mehr als angemessen. Ich kann jedem Freund vom Wuselfaktor (Siedler), Dortsimulationen (Banished) und Aufbaustrategie nur empfehlen. \nAlle anderen sollten es sich zumindest mal anschauen, denn dieses Spiel ist einzigartig und das sollte gew\u00fcrdigt werden.  :)", "timestamp_created": 1491152981, "timestamp_updated": 1491153481, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.587778", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30886721": {"recommendationid": "30886721", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022667107", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5241, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491084415}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game for early access.

I see many people comparing it to Banished - which is a fair comparison. However, in my opinion, this game has already overtaken Banished with its mechanics. Banished was released and forgotten by its developer, has no end game and no requirement to expand unless you want to go until your village collapses in on itself (though I do like the game very much and you'll probably enjoy it if you enjoy this). This game also has no end game, but it recieves updates, tweaks and there is a rapid difficulty curve with the incoming mobs that forces you to expand. \nSomething else I've noted in the negative reviews is that NPCs fail to pick up items on the ground - which is not true. They do not pick it up immediately, but they will do so when an NPC of the appropriate job comes along and is empty handed. NPCs also do not \"cross the village\" to attack mobs on a regular basis. Some wil break off from their job when nearby a mob or fight - potentially to fight or run. In general, there is no major issue with the AI, assuming you have everything needed for it to function. The most notable frustration is that when they are attack in the middle of a task they will drop their item to fight or run.

I got it on sale for $5, but even the default price of $10 is reasonable. I bought this less than a week ago as of this review and I already have over 24 hours put into it. The dev is also extremely active so I'm confident in the game's future.\n\n-Plenty of content already - a lot of resources, items, and buildings to create.\n\n\nCons:\n\n-Slow pace. The dev has already expressed he has no plans to include a 2x/3x speed option like in games such as Banished or RimWorld, however he will be including a Haste spell to speed your workers up. From what I can tell, this spell will really only be truly useful in the very first 2 or 3 days, because after that you will want to save your mana to blow up enemy spawns. So I don't think that the Haste spell will really solve much. The dev has stated higher speeds would be unnecessary because of the pace of the game, but I find myself with tons of downtime at every stage of the game. If it is a problem of implementation, I can understand, but I see no reason why an optional 2x or 3x speed button shouldn't be added.\n\n-Difficulty does not continue to scale. Now that I've done a few runs and I have a strategy for early-mid game, I'm completely ironclad and unstoppable by around day 11. More enemies will probably need to be added (remember you can always do resizes/recolors of existing sprites, nobody gets too upset about that as long as it's not rampant) that can add to more of a late game challenge.\n\n-Defense is pretty easy. All you need to do is make a large perimeter for your base and include a single choke point. Because of the enemy AI, they will walk across the entire map just to get to that choke point. I would recommend adding a certain distance threshold for enemies so that if they have to walk a certain distance to get around a wall, they will instead attack the nearest wall. This will force players to maintain multiple points of defense instead of one easily defended chokepoint.\n\n\nMisc suggestions:\n\nQuarries like in Banished - on rock floor areas, maybe you could add a building that allows villagers to mine a set amount of rock and iron from a 10x10 spot or however large you'd deem it. My reasoning for this is that I often run out of stone toward the end of the second year, and this would add another way of getting some. It's basically like they're hollowing out that part of the ground.\n\nDiagonal roads - just make it so that when roads are connected to another road by only the corner you use a particular diagonal-road sprite. This is for both aesthetic reasons and because diagonal roads are obviously useful given by their automatic creation by the NPCs' pathing.\n\nAlternative food sources - domesticated animals, fish.\n\nTowers that induce status effects (slow, bleed, decrease armor, etc)", "timestamp_created": 1486947346, "timestamp_updated": 1486947346, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.575632", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29885375": {"recommendationid": "29885375", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042885238", "num_games_owned": 69, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2373, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512699280}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is perfect. It's a lot of fun. Yes, it's true that you get bored of it and stop playing it. But here's the thing: Another update, which are quite frequent, drags me back in. Yeah, it's pretty simple, but it still is awesome. Rayvolution, the dev, puts his heart and soul into this game, and it has paid off. I got this game quite a while ago, though I still find myself coming back everyonce and a while. If you really do get bored, make up a challenge, like, for example, only golem combobulators as defense. Overall, this game is pretty darn awesome.\n\nEdit:\nThis game is about to get a lot more interesting. Soon, there will be many more towers and defenses. That's not all. Rayvolution's also going to add elemental damage and whatnot. For example: Skeletons don't take very much damage from piercing attacks, but if you use crushing attacks, it's a completely different story. This will add a lot more depth to the game, and with it, a desire to get to higher days, allowing for more gameplay. Rayvolution has to be one of my favorite developers out there. He put a lot of effort into this game, and I believe he deserves recognition. Oh, and the music's sick\n\nEdit 2:\nThe game has gotten a lot more interesting. The new towers add a lot more depth to the game, and it makes it so I end up playing for a lot longer on each file. The game is freaking amazing. That is all thanks to the amazing dev, Rayvolution, who has spent many, many hours on this game. In the next update, disasters, guards, gates, and things of all kinds will be added. I am currently playing the unstable and it is a lot of fun so far. Once again, I have to mention, the music is marvelous. There are constantly new songs being added. This is a game that is worth $10, but if you can get it on sale, even if only for like 2 bucks off, it is SO worth it in my opinion. If you like Godlikes, I bet you will like this a lot!\n\nEdit 3: The Dev is constantly adding new stuff. There is always something new to try and explore in this game. Say you get bored of the easy beginning in survival mode. Simply turn it up a notch and go to nightmare mode. Then realize that nightmare mode is REDICULOUSLY hard and make some custom rules. Almost every 2 weeks there is some interesting unstable, and just a month or two after that, depending on how big the update is, you get a complete update with amazing new features. Say you find a new bug, which you probably find a small one or more as it is an early access game, talk to the dev, and you may just find that simply a day or two later, BAM, problem solved.

I bought this game hoping it can be a roguelike type of village management like Dwarf Fortress, but it turned out to be more of a tower defense RTS at the current state. You build a village - attract monsters - defend and expand the village. That's about it.\n\n\nI like that the player is sort of a god / guardian to the people. You can drag&drop villagers and critters around, and cast a limited selection of magic in the game. This reminds me of older games like Black & White. However, I feel the current game lacks an objective. I like that they changed the name to Rise to Ruins, which is literally the objective of RL games like Rimworld or Dwarf Fortress, but this game currently is pretty much just about expanding and defending a village.

It's pretty fun, especially if you acquire it at the price of 5$ like i did. It reminds me of banished in its' managment style, yet its' objective is (like i said before) to get you [h1]killed[/h1]. Needless to say I have my fingers crossed for a [h1]difficulty[/h1] setting or even an adaptive [h1]dificulty[/h1]. Hopefully the [b]DEV[/b] w[b]IL[/b]l see this as he seems pretty involved.\n\n[h1]24 Hour update[/h1]\nI totally believe this game is worth its [b]10$[/b] price point, in fact I plan on buying it for my brother.\n[b]What I See[/b]\nSurvival mode provides a satisfying challenge, after each raid by monsters you feel some relief having survived the night. But after you have built up there is not much to stress on defence\nP.S. build tons of wood golem generators, it's the way to go.\n[b]What I want[/b]\nHoping to see the upcoming inventory update and how its implemented.\nPlus I think it would be cool if there was some type of levelable character like a hero atached to your profile, though I don't know if this is really the place for ideas. whatever\n\n[h1]75 Hour update[/h1]\n\nContent has been added at quite the swift rate, updates come and go and its very much appreciated.\n\n[b]THE GOOD[/b]\nAs mentioned the updates come at a decent rate and the dev is still quite involved with the game. He also nerfed my wood golems so indefinite survival is no longer a go. The challenge is back boys\n\n[b]THE BAD[/b]\nHE NERFED MY GOLEMS, I mean it had to be done as life was much too easy but the lack of a good medium is present again. Survival will probably please the hardcore players and peaceful will please some of the light casuals but I still can't find the right mode for me. To put it more into view I spend a couple of hours in each gameplay and near the end you helplessly accept your fate and it's frustrating. There is no out of game rewards to help you next time and you probably won't experience late game features do to your unfortunate circumstance. \n\n[b]THE OTHER[/b]\nSome things that I think I would like to see\n- Controllable hero WASD style, not too strong to were it changes the game broken but to add some flavor to the game, limit him on stamina and strength or something and make him       semi-autonomous\n- Better leveling on the golems or regeneration at spawn so they survive to level up as they cant match with the skeletons !!! WARNING TOXIC JOKE !!!( more like skeleTONS as in they will crowd all up in your face )\n- Perks you can keep earned through gameplay, possibly implemented into the hero idea\n\nThis is just my two cents as I like the game enough that i wrote this review. Hope some more people pick up this neat little game as I need you guys to fund my updates\n\n[h1] 89 HOURS at 1 1/2 years [/h1]\nCame back to this game several days ago (12/17/2017) to find several nice suprises, tons of new changes along with convincing my brother to play this after the betrayal that was Gnomaria!

This game, alas, falls into the later category.  \n\nMy main issues:\n1.  There is no good way to control overheating in summer.  Especially when the 1200hp Zombie is fighting them all in the middle of the day.  They stand and fight and die of heat exhaustion.  \n2.  The monster difficulty seems to grow exponentially.  On day 3, it's not uncommon for 700 to 800 hp monsters to waltz through my defences.  By day 5, they're close to 1500 hp.  I've never made it past that point, so I can only guess how vastly overpowered they become.\n3.  The inability to rotate buildings.  When most buildings are rectangles, it helps to compact your base.\n4.  The monsters just break through the walls, rather than going through the killing maze.  It's impossible to concentrate enough fire when they come through whatever wall is inconvenient to them.\n5.  What it boils down to is a tower defence game with a focus on the infrastructure behind the towers.  It's not what I was expecting from a village simulator.  I'm not a big fan of tower defence games to begin with, so this was a rather sad realization.\n6.  There are no guards or soldiers.  You get golems who can't stand a chance against anything but a slime.  It would be nice to have soldiers who could sortie out and soften up the monsters.\n\nEDIT:\nI am changing my review to positive.  The developer is prompt and courteous, and there seems to be a lot of changes in the works.  I kind of forgot the game is in alpha still because of how well it looks and, aside from the frustrations mentioned above, works.  \n\nI suppose, deep down, I'm afraid of getting burned by another Towns.

I don't believe this game will ever be good anymore. The biggest problem with it, it's EXTREMELY UNFAIR.\n\nI bought it very soon after it first showed up on Steam, it was crude, with few features. To this day it received A LOT of updates. The problem is - this is how gameplay always looks like:\n\n- build camp, build basic structures with very high resource cost, that takes some time\n- build basic defences and wall - oh, monsters will just go through the water if you surrounded with wall from 1 side. And they can destroy forests and mountains! either build wall from all sides, keeping all imporatant resources inside (impossible) or... build a maze with walls, so monsters will take longer to enter and you will have more time for towers to shoot them\n- monsters get stronger and stronger with each night, forever, you can't just have defese, you must CONSTANTLY build more towers and after short time they make so little damage, that monsters easily destroy them\n- all over the map enemy bases show up, you can use spells to destroy them - this will drain all your mana\n- what the hell are farms doing??? why they give almost no food? oh, you must use motivate land spell, to get enough food - choose: food or destroying enemy bases that spawn infinite enemies\n- villagers constantly die, because they don't ran away from monsters. You are building some stuff and suddenly \"VILLAGER WAS KILLED BY SLIME (lvl 3)\" - wtf? they were near 3 working towers, I didn't even know we were being attacked (eh you always are in this game, day and night), why couldn't this villager run back?\n- you finally get most basic buildings and now enemy attacks are so strong that you have to focus almost entirely on defense\n- spells are a JOKE, there are only couple good ones and all offensive are piece of SH IT. You want to help your villages fighting? What you gonna use, meteor from the sky or fire on them all? all you can do is GRAB enemies and move them to far part of the map (they will come back, sooner or later), so you move map back and forth, grabbing enemies like crazy, so they don't kill your people. Sometimes they all stand on same square, so you can't select the enemy and you just watch as they kill villagers.\n- attacks on your base get so big and constant that game slows down, bad optimization\n- the enemies waves get so large, they will get to your base, destroy all towers, all buildings and kill everybody, that's what happens every time, no matter what you do\n- then you got this awesome feature (that could be good if game was fair), were you only have 50 villagers per world (profile) - if you didn't throw your villagers to cullis gate, before they were all killed, you have to start new profile\n\n\nNot fun, unfair, not rewarding, it's all about defense, buidling base is secondary.", "timestamp_created": 1480777886, "timestamp_updated": 1480778289, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 26, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.537931", "comment_count": "25", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "28151343": {"recommendationid": "28151343", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120380872", "num_games_owned": 260, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1434, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498171122}, "language": "english", "review": "Got a lot of potential and will be a great game !

build a maze if you want to\n* Weather mechanics that do things rather than just for visuals\n* Villagers aren't completely retarded\n* You can help the villagers build things by dropping resources on buildings yourself\n* If a villager sees a floating rock they get confused\n* You can amass a golem army\n\nCons:\n* Stone Slingers couldn't shoot over walls that other ranged weapons could (bullet, bow, fire)\n* The game lags quite a bit after playing the same map for awhile\n* The game lags with alot of things on screen at once (Could probably hide things off screen to save on resources)\n* Enemies like to \"wander\" into the village with a path from across the map, instead of only when they are \"wandering into the village\"\n* Walls prevent you from building on the other side once closed off\n* Villagers only repair things inside your \"circle of influence\" leading to walls being destroyed that lie outside it\n* Stone walls can be damaged by fire and can be caught on fire, yet skeletons can't be caught on fire\n* When a villager sees an enemy, they sometimes run like babies\n* Skeletons are too spooky\n* Spectre's have insane amounts of health\n* Villagers can starve too easily if you don't build at least 5 farms at the start\n* Having to stockpile food for summer doesn't seem right\n* Villagers can \"overheat\" in the winter, while it's snowing\n* When the \"Problem Report\" states that one of your villagers is on fire, there is no easy way to find them and save them\n* Villagers can catch fire while in water\n* There is no Smite ability that you can use\n\n",

He seems to be astoundingly active, quickly answering messages on twitter, Steam and the dedicated official game site, which is itself well maintained with an artful attention to detail. \n\nUpdates come thick and fast, with a casual little suggestion of mine turning up in a patch a day later. Very gratifying! You can really see how determined he is to make this something great, accounting for every piece of feedback. So I'm fully reassured that, even though it's almost two year's since the successful Kickstarter, Retro-Pixel Castles will eventually reach a proper, full release, however long is need to make it a really great gaming experience.\n\nAs of the current version, inDev22e, I'd say that the game alone is only just about worth it's price tag. There are a couple of nights worth of obsessive play in there, building out your village and defense setup, provided you have a modicum of patience to get into it. After failing initially, I personally watched the handily linked 'tutorial' video, to get the gist of a few basics. The in-game tips were very helpful too. But having figured out how to survive the initial onslaught, the excitement does trail off... The transition to starting a new village map is currently a little rough and without any campaign mechanism in place yet there's no particular motivation to go through the motions more than a couple times.\n\nHowever, it looks like the game's meta is due to change with the upcoming monthly major update and there are a lot of promising additions lined up. Really looking forwards to the future of this project. :-)\n\nBear in mind that while this game is the same genre as Rimworld, it's pretty distinct from it - it's more like supervising a colony of ants, with no capacity or need to micromanage each little person. I feel the villager AI works pretty well, but it's best not to worry too much about the fine detail, just plan out your build strategy and keep an eye on those monsters. Also, there's a significant (and hopefully growing) tower defense aspect to the play, with it being possible to build little mazes for enemies to path through while getting shot. Quite a novel marriage of two of my favorite, most addictive game genres!\n\nAlso be warned that the game can run a little choppily under certain circumstances, but is getting better optimized with each update and refinements are also due that should help avoid overly demanding conditions.

While still in Early Access, it shows promise and it is by no means a small feat, given the fact that this title is the dev team\u2019s first Steam project.\n \n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nEven though there\u2019s not one playthrough similar to another, Retro-Pixel Castles does offer the necessary tools and assets needed for both the survival as well as thriving of the miniaturized society being simulated in our case. If there\u2019s one good thing that comes out of such random scenarios, is that boredom has a hard time setting in provided you are familiar with the god game formula. It\u2019s definitely harder than economic simulators/city builders that are more abundent on Steam. You have to constantly keep an eye on your villagers and protect them from natural hazards and foes, while also having a clear expansion pattern as the resources on the maps do encourage some planning ahead. The game\u2019s tutorial felt a bit thin on content and tips, but there\u2019s still room for improvement. While it may seem rather difficult for beginners, once you know how to prioritize your building projects and manage the initial small population, things become much easier.\n \nThe audio-visual department is the one that might require some more tinkering from the developer\u2019s side. Music and soud effects seem quite repetitive while the fonts have a slight resolution problem. Zooming in or out would be nice touches as the pixelated graphics don\u2019t bother me at all. In such a game which features enough gameplay complexity as it is, the eye candy can be safely overlooked.\n\nEDIT: Trading Cards have been added to this game.\n \n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n+ Steam Trading Cards\n+ Randomly generated assets\n+ Freedom of choice with an open-ended storyline\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n- No Achievements\n- Still in Early Access\n- Sounds are repetitive\n\n[h1]Result / Final thoughts[/h1]\nIt is truly unfortunate that we have such a limited selection of god games on the Steam Store, but we must make do with what can be found already as well as the newly released ones. Retro-Pixel Castles is just such a title, both promising and with a charm of its own. More than enough to stand out and not be considered just a shout-out to an often neglected genre.\n\n[b]Rating 7/10[/b]\n \n[quote]This review was submitted for [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/elitegives]Elite Giveaways[/url], check us out for more reviews ranging from Indie games to AAA titles.[/quote]", "timestamp_created": 1476185035, "timestamp_updated": 1513893224, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.676549", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25977532": {"recommendationid": "25977532", "author": {"steamid": "76561198033798786", "num_games_owned": 203, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 8899, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1040, "last_played": 1513725249}, "language": "english", "review": "The frequency and depth of updates is truly staggering.

(I do so I loved this game.)  \n\nFor the most part, the gameplay and buildings are fairly straightforward.  There's definitely a learning curve to this game, though.  You will most likely have to start over at least a couple times. However, once you figure out your strategy and build a solid defence, the only struggle may be to have enough food during the winter.  \n\nAs it's not finished yet, the game is still lacking, but I got 15 hours of good gameplay out of this game in it's current state. (Owned it for about a week as I write this).  I got it on sale for about $5 which is already well worth the price even without the fact that it will be updated.  My personal check for games is that it's, at least, satisfactory if it provides enough fun game play for one hour for every dollar it cost.  (So 3 hours/dollar so far is pretty good.)\n\nQuick tips if you want them:\n-Focus on a good defense ASAP. There's always room for improvement. Like dont even worry about having all the necessary housing.  You start in spring so the villagers can go a few nights outside.  Just build a good wall and defense towers (and ammo supply) ,  And use natural barriers to your adventure (forests and mountains.)\n\n-Don't spready yourself thin, too fast.  You start off with only so many people.  If you start building and employing all the different manufacturing and refining buildings, Your people will be spread thin among all them and it'll take forever to get more important things dones.\n\n-Edges to waters aren't as defensive as you think.  If you build a wall ending perpendicular to a body of water, monsters can still swim around the edge (Depending on what the quickest path is.)\n\n-Destroy spawners asap.  Use the Fireball power on any spawners that pop up (red squares on minimap).  You don't need to destroy them completely.  If you hit them, they'll slowly burn until they're destroyed (unless it starts to rain.)", "timestamp_created": 1475657860, "timestamp_updated": 1475657860, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499703", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25847603": {"recommendationid": "25847603", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051442592", "num_games_owned": 201, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1935, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504954546}, "language": "english", "review": "It was a good pickup, Dev is working on it consistently.

Combining my two favourite genres, TD and RTS with a pinch of Roller Coaster Tycoon, I have so far had an absolute blast. \n\nThe game starts you on an island world map with the choice of your settling point - You can even go in and look at the maps first before setting up. Once you do that, you've got to balance the livelihoods of your population whilst being besieged by armies of monsters. You begin by gathering the basics - Food and Wood, but over time becoming accustomed with a diverse collection of structures and materials. Production lines form, your civilisation grows, squeezing in between valleys and digging into the safety of bedrock, rather than risking expanding outwards. In turn, beyond your bastions, holes open in the ground in increasing number as more enemies spill onto the map, slowly colouring the minimap red. \n\nThe gameplay remains perfectly in flow with a fluctuating day/night cycle and on top of which 4 seasons that constantly mix up gameplay with various weather and effects on your settlement. You really have to stock up for winter (And the first year I massively over prepared, but better safe than sorry!) HINT - MAKE AS MANY FARMS AS YOU CAN - 28 farmers was a sustainable number for me (Whilst enriching wild food collections at the same time!).\n\nMost tower defences suffer from the same issue over time that they become tedious as you perfect your strategy. The twist that has hooked me for RPC is you have the option to send units to \"limbo\", essentially a menu screen where you can dish out your settlers to a variety of different lands on the map. I spent an hour just surveying the various maps and looking for potential choke points, weighing up the different collections of resources in each area, hesitant to send my villagers to certain doom after such a firm foothold on my first settlement.\n\nTo add to this, I found myself grappling with the dilemmas of logging regulation (Do I flatten the forest to supplement my bow towers with arrows, but deal with the long grow back time and pathways destroying the treeline opened up) and I found myself picking single people to inhabit my future settlement to avoid breaking up my many many married couples (170 villagers so far!) \n\nAnother fantastic mechanic is the line of sight for defences - Punishing players who box themselves in by preventing them from expanding beyond their walls. There were many times where I'd tear down a couple of the inner walls to frantically assemble some lines of trenches further forwards whilst fighting off hordes of monsters then patch my defences back up before nightfall. It puts a lot more risk in expansion and forces you to avoid greediness.\n\nThe game has such depth that I've sunk over half a day into the Retro Pixel Castles over the weekend. \n\nIt's just such a good game! I can't put it any simpler than that, haven't felt so transfixed about a strategy game since I discovered Age of Empires 2. \n\nAdmittedly, the lack of a built in tutorial is something that could do with addressing, but obviously with Early Access I'm sure it's something that'll come about in time. The video that was linked in the game did provide me with enough information to get started with, so thank you for providing that. Having said this, discovering the functions of the game over time has been quite satisfying in itself - I'm still unlocking the mysteries of essence!\n\nIt's a bit of a far fetched request (Especially with the number of units and stuff going on at once, but I would adore a co-op mode for this. \n\nEither way, amazing work, and I look forward to any approaching updates for the project.", "timestamp_created": 1475532674, "timestamp_updated": 1475532674, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25843667": {"recommendationid": "25843667", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999390811", "num_games_owned": 440, "num_reviews": 108, "playtime_forever": 54, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475530339}, "language": "english", "review": "Not yet.\n\nFont is painful.

Para ello, tienes que sobrevivir en un continente con varios terrenos en los que \"desplegar\" tu centro de la aldea, elegir dentro de esa zona (mapa ya de juego) el lugar m\u00e1s apropiado para asentarte, expandirte y crecer.\n\nNecesitas explotar 4 recursos: alimentos, madera, piedra y cristal, y llegado el momento, refinarlos. A base de refinar obtendr\u00e1s nuevos recursos con los que crear mejores edificios y defensas.\n\nEl primer a\u00f1o de supervivencia vendr\u00eda a ser un tutorial, o al menos es cuando te llegan los consejos. Cada a\u00f1o consta de las cuatro estaciones y cada estaci\u00f3n de un pu\u00f1ao de d\u00edas. Con la llegada de la noche los monstruos se activan m\u00e1s de lo debido, y van a tratar de arrasar la aldea.\n\n------------\n\nHe necesitado 3 intentos antes de sacar un juego decente. El primero no ten\u00eda idea de nada y me dediqu\u00e9 a hacer probatinas (desactivados los consejos, estaba m\u00e1s perdido que un pulpo en un garaje), el segundo ya hab\u00eda descubierto algunas cosas, y con los consejos activados, fue algo mejor, por lo que pas\u00e9 directamente al tercero, en el cual me encuentro actualmente. Primavera del tercer a\u00f1o, me encuentro c\u00f3modo con mi zona y ya me he expandido pr\u00e1cticamente por un tercio del mapa.\n\nDe los 32 aldeanos que contaba al principio, ahora son cerca de 140. En el primer a\u00f1o me atrincher\u00e9 apoy\u00e1ndome del entorno y en el segundo comenc\u00e9 lentamente la expansi\u00f3n.

Voy trabajando en etapas de expansi\u00f3n por el d\u00eda, ganando terreno y construyendo defensas, asentando de forma s\u00f3lida la posici\u00f3n antes de continuar con la ampliaci\u00f3n.\n\nDudo mucho que la m\u00e1quina sea capaz de \"echarme\" de la zona, estoy c\u00f3modo y la siento m\u00eda, por lo que en cuanto la tenga dominada (de aqu\u00ed al 5to o 6to a\u00f1o, supongo), iniciar\u00e9 una nueva aldea en el continente, en alguna de las zonas colindantes (enti\u00e9ndase, otro mapa).\n\n----------------------\n\nHay un par de cosas que no me cuadran de la versi\u00f3n actual:\n- Cullis gate. Hay varias en la zona y sirven para traer y meter cosas del Limbo.

Got a notification telling me about the (current sale) price of 5 dollars. Thought why the hell not.\n\nI skipped over the tutorial video because I didn't feel like watching it, so I mostly learned from experimenting and reading the tool tips that would pop up. Certain game mechanics were pretty straight forward, others seemed to be slightly confusing or not explained very well.\n\nEasy to grasp: Trees make wood, you chop trees, you get wood.\nConfused for the first time playing: Farms make food, but you have to gather food to plant in them? First thought that the farms just made food so I wouldn't have to scavange what was on the map, but I realized I was mistaken when my villagers began starving to death.\n\nAnother example of something not explained were the \"Ancient Radiance Pools\", which I had to google to figure out what they did and decided that I wanted to destroy them. Was it a good idea? Who knows, what they really do and their purpose still isn't 100% clear.\n\nBut pretty much all of these things can be fixed or adjusted along the way because this IS an early access game. After a good five hours of playing I feel that my village is mostly complete. There are still things that I need to build or modify to make it feel complete, but I am not afraid of monster invasions, starving to death, or homelessness (However winter is coming...).\n\nOverall I have enjoyed what the game has to offer so far and will mostly continue to play it until I burn myself out on it and then pick it up when the next major patch is released. The dev says they will not charge for or release any support DLC for the game, but in this day and age I don't trust anyone anymore.

As it's Early Access the content is currently limited, but there is enough to get a good idea of how great this game could be should it continue to go the direction it is currently being developed.\n\nWhat do you do?\n\nYou can build a village, collect resources, expand your population, defend your land from monsters that attack at night, and then expand your control beyond the current map and export units/resources to \"Limbo\" where you can access them on other maps as part of the World Map system.\n\nWhat can't you do (yet)?\n\nCurrently there are no animals, as noted by the dev. Building diversity is also very limited; you can see one or two variations of defensive buildings that use each resource type, there is essentially only one gathering building for each type of resource (wood, stone, and crystal), only one resource \"refining\" building for each type of resource, inventory management is a bit awkward--no ability to to prioritize what resources get stored in large storage buildings. Also magic buildings are limited to a portal to Limbo, an essence collecter (used to power magic defense structures), and a crystal motivator (regenerates your natural crystal deposits so they can be harvested sooner.), and a few defensive buildings.\n\nThere is also currently only one playable race/faction. I would love to see different races / tribes that have alternate methods of collecting resources and different technologies/structures. As someone who grew up with Warcraft 2 and 3, I really fell in love with the base building. (I loved how the Undead didn't have to travel to collect gold, and how the Night Elves could collect wood without destroying trees, thus allowing forests to exist as walls where-as the Humans/Orcs eventually destroy every resource in their path to find each other.)\n\nMusic is simple and satisfying, but I think it could use more variety as with most of the rest of the game.\n\nI hope the dev keeps on improving this game because I'm hooked, I want to see more but I'm afraid even when I expand to my second base there won't be anything but new terrain to see.\n\ntl;dr:\n\nThis game is a fun mix of Dwarf Fortress and Warcraft 2/3.

Wenn man aber einmal den Punkt gefunden hat das man gut klar kommt (Sollten keine 10-20min dauern) ist es ein mittel bis leichtes spiel.

Man hat verschiedene Zauber oder F\u00e4higkeiten die einen das Spiel bzw das Leben der Bewohner vereinfachen sollen.

I am actually pretty excited to come back to this game in the future.\n\nWHICH IS WHAT FREAKING EARLY ACCESS IS!", "timestamp_created": 1469520625, "timestamp_updated": 1469520625, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508914", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "24425044": {"recommendationid": "24425044", "author": {"steamid": "76561198126410482", "num_games_owned": 103, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 74, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487491208}, "language": "russian", "review": "!", "timestamp_created": 1469021284, "timestamp_updated": 1469021284, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.345761", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "24406637": {"recommendationid": "24406637", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960559290", "num_games_owned": 151, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 13082, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506110572}, "language": "english", "review": "7/19/2016 - They're still planning on adding new things to the game, like inventories.

For $10 you can go see a movie that you will enjoy for less time.  Having said that the game starts getting boring after you've built your crystillery.\n\nSuggestions for dev (not sure if this is the best place):\n- Chill out and take a step back from the crafting system and adding all that in.  You gotta work on some basics before forging ahead with the crafting system and additional rare resources.  Below are just a few problems that could easily be fixed:\n- Make controlling the builders queue easier - i.e. allow us to reassign or side-track a worker to a specific task by right clicking on the target (a right click for a building being built will automatically assign them to work on it, etc, but only if they're already a builder or whatever task is associated with the object you clicked on).  This would save so many villagers, and give me more control to survive...  from there if it becomes too easy it would just be a matter of adjusting monster values I would think.\n- Fix the worker pathing alrogithms because currently I cannot create a zig-zag fortress entryway of Tower Defense without my workers being unable to service my towers.  UPDATE**** this appears to be an unintentional side effect of walls not having any influence.  If you wall your structures (towers) into a tunnel before they are built your workers will forget about them because they fall outside of your zone of influence, which is dumb because obviously they ARE within your zone, but your walls are lifeless, zoneless blocks of zombie blocking goodness.  That was confusing.  I think I need to go see a therapist now.\n- Allow workers to alter terrain in a more advanced town.  Getting sick of having to build around mud pits, bah!\n- When you instruct a worker to DESTROY a resource... shouldn't that resource fall to the ground anyway instead of disappearing?\n\nBig ideas:\n- Expand the magic side of the game (how it's used, collected, saved, etc).   Allow for someone to differentiate a town to specialize in magic or non-magic.

At the moment there's not much to it, however. If you like building villages, micro-managing resources and villager needs, RPC has a few good things going for it, but there's also a lot holding it back, including the word \"castle\".\n\nIt's tough; really tough actually, and if you screw up, you pretty much have to make a new profile to try again, you can't just pick a different area on the map. This is a minor annoyance given that you can easily screw yourself over, especially while just learning the game.\n\nI like that there's enemies to defend your castle against, but they -easily- overwhelm most defenses, and at the moment, the only way to defend is tower-defense-like mazes you have to build, where half of the towers are pretty much useless. I found the fire towers to draw way too much power to be useful and the rock towers near useless since they have to be out in the open,(can't be behind walls) right where enemies can easily swarm it, making the point of it, to roll a rock down a line of enemies, useless. Real castles didn't work this way, they had gates, moats, walls you could sit on and shoot down, etc. I really wish there was more \"castle\" in this game. There really isn't, it's more akin to Retro-Pixel Villages.\n\nIt's a fun little game, I like the aesthetic, and I like most of the resource managment and crafting system, but I'm gonna wait and come back to it later when/if/hopefully they add more \"castle\" elements like walls with gates and such, I'm tired of making mazes and getting overwhelmed, and when more later-game content comes in.

There is a data screen that will highlight those paths for you.  Once my population was wealthy enough, I upgraded all my roads, which also gave my people a reason to keep chopping down trees and mining rocks.  Work, my little peoples, work!\n\nI love this game.

the game cannot be won...\n\nNow, although the concept is kind of fun, I want to point out that if I would have seen this, it would have be a no sale for me, right off the bat.  Suggestion:  maybe two modes - 'Story'(or something else) and 'Endless' (Many games include those already).  I'd definitely be a happy camper...I mean, not being able to beat a game is kind of fun, but seeing the map layout and the fact that you can transfer untis and what not to other locations does show a lot of potential - but I'm not willing to build for 20+ hours only to see it swarmed by a horde of mini-aombies...\n\n...and, well, I don't know what RPC could ever mean, other than the programming term...frustrating!  :)", "timestamp_created": 1465506297, "timestamp_updated": 1465596292, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23454898": {"recommendationid": "23454898", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001807994", "num_games_owned": 248, "num_reviews": 128, "playtime_forever": 746, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497507354}, "language": "english", "review": "Well, I had to rereview this after a year of waiting for the game to get out of SUPER EARLY ACCESS and now that it is, i can say this game is definitely worth 10 dollars. it wouldn't be worth 15 right now; but there are other features still down the pike; and to the best of my knowledge the 10 dollar price is here to stay. this is worth it.\n\nedit: \n\nthis has gotten much better in many many ways!

onslought of baddies(allot of thinking involved)\n\nand decide where and when to use your godly influence to aid the development of your people.\n\nthere is plenty of options as far as how you choose to survive. \n\nplenty of different towers to choose from, magical golems to fight for you, spells to attack directly, different techs to go after and in different orders. like aremor for your people, along with weapons, tools to help them work faster,  refined food products, healers, expediters, road workers,.....ect.ect....\n\nand as a final note, the dev is amazing at what he do. he responds really (really really) fast to any issues. is updating the game at redicules speeds. he just added more game modes. \n\nmap editor, \nmusic is golden.\ngame is great at chalenging you.\nnice people in

To be a village sim you might need a little more than that, honestly.\n\nYou are constantly attacked by monsters, day and night, without breaks. You can't tell your villagers to defend, you can only build towers (that are inadequate for the amount of monsters you receive), and hope for some villager to try and defend and not die. Because if they die, the only way to have another villager is to give free time (aka, stop building your village defenses) to your workers and wait a loooong time before a new one is born, while in the mean time you have less defenses and even more monsters.\n\nThe AI is very lackluster: building two or more buildings at a time really confuse builders, with the end result of having both of them unfinished for minutes. Gathering resource is dumb too, with villagers going for random sources instead of the nearest ones. Attacking enemies seems random too, with villagers attacking once, then starting to flee, then attacking again, then fleeing in the middle of other enemies, then dying.\n\nOn the art side of things: the graphics and UI are gorgeous. The sound track is quite good, although it isn't contextual: you can have an happy and reassuring track while the village is getting slaughtered. Particle effects are really cool and really add a lot to the presentation of the game.\n\nFor now I absolutely cannot recommend this game in the current state.

Even though it\u00b4s still in development, it looks very promising.\n\nIt\u00b4s a combination of a management game and a godgame, where you have to build, maintain and protect your own village(s). And those two genres have been merged together very well in this game.\n\nI recently bought it as I saw it in the store and it caught my attention. It looked like a simple management game, indie style. I have played Banished before, and it looks a bit like it, but this game has it's own characteristics as well. You have an \"influence bar\", which acts as a mana bar. With this influence, you can cast godly spells to improve land, fireball land/enemies/enemy buildings and much more.\n\nThe game itself is very simple: You start with a global map with a couple of locations where you can start your first village. When you've chosen your location, you can start building! But you have to be fast. Just like other games, the night is very dangerous. The first night will remail calm, but the second night things go down... quickly.\n\nThe game has a season mechanic. You start in the spring, the easiest of all 4 seasons as food grows the quickest in this season. You have to stockpile food to make sure you can get through the summer, where food growth is significantly slower. The autumn is the second best season, where you can recover from the summer. Though not optimal, it's still good enough to re-establish your food stockpile, as the next season is the harshest: winter. Food growth is almost at a halt, so you better have some food stored. However, with your godly abilities you can grab food from over the map and drop it in the village, to make sure you'll get through winter... if you even get there.\n\nBecause when playing the regular game, survival mode, so-called \"graveyards\" and \"slime spawns\" spawn quite often, spawning many enemies. Eventually a lot of the map is covered with these graveyards and when the night comes, they can assault your village. If you haven't prepared your defences before that happens, it's pretty much over (RIP me :( ).\n\nBut if you want to take it easy, there is also a peaceful mode, where almost no enemies spawn. It's a good way to learn the mechanics, as it's way more forgiving if you are a bit slow. If you don't know how to play the game at first, at the main menu there's a button which redirects you to a youtube video, explaining some of the basic mechanics of the game. It's quite helpful. You'll get tips on how to make your defences as good as possible and how different defensive towers work.\n\nIt has some performence issues (at least for me) when autosaving, where your screen freezes for the duration. It isn't that bad, its usually for less than a second. There isn't however a way to decrease graphics so you have to play with a lot of particles all the time. And it's a lot, because there has been a lot of attention to details, which I absolutely love.\n\nThe soundtrack is cute and athmospheric. It makes this game even more cute than it already is. That, which the sometimes corky and sometimes sarcastic pop-ups when you lose a villager or at the splashart of the main menu, makes it a very cute product over all.\n\nI'd give this an 8/10. It's very cute, it shows potential. However, it is a bit repetitive as you cannot develop a lot with for example a tech-tree or something. It's more like when you can process your wood and stone, you can basically build everything, which makes it somewhat less exciting rather quick. Yet it's a good game to kill some time with.

When looking at the only panel that lists all villagers, I can't tell hardly anything about any of them besides their level. Seeing any other information about them on that panel would be incrediblly useful, as would be the ability to sort them differently or click their names as links in alerts.\n-Children (though they are agood game mechanic) currently make understanding your population difficult.\n-Some god powers are difficult and/or confusing to use.\n-It is very difficult and frustrating to attempt to navigate combat, or any other situation where a large amount of villagers and/or other creatures are stacked on top of one another - it's so hard to have an actual grasp on how the fighting is going, or if a villager needs healing because you it's so difficult to select them in the chaos.\n-I really wish I there was an option to disable the screen shaking so constantly.\n-----------\nThat's all I've thought up for now, but I'll try and keep this relatively updated.", "timestamp_created": 1464143724, "timestamp_updated": 1464152504, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.568460", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23193140": {"recommendationid": "23193140", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062529245", "num_games_owned": 115, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 4527, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511757902}, "language": "english", "review": "I really like this game, it is heavy on the CPU, which prevents me from getting more than 8 fps (sits at around 2-4 fps) so it can be a bit frustrating when you start to get into it, but the system is well thought out.

Not to say I didn't enjoy it, it's just a very slow game. No time speed ups so get used to normal game time all the time. The game is enjoyable, but nothing that would keep you on constantly. This is something you can best play while writing a paper or cleaning your room. \"You guys go this, and I'm gonna read /pol/ posts until you make a ding\" Was pretty much the game plan. A couple time's I took a nap and woke up with doubled population (and one time when everyone just starved to death)\n\nA lot of the god powers are pretty useless depending on which play mode you play (Survival or Peaceful). Like in survival, I found the only useful tool was the pickup button. When ever a hoard would come I woild pick off one by one and toss them on the other side of the map.\n\nAt first I would keep checking the Alerts button to see what I can do to help my people, but after a while it became something to be ignored. A lot of problems that I faced I can do nothing about. \n>\"So n' so is on fire\" \n>Picks up person and puts in water. \n>He walks out and keeps being too hot.\n\nAlso, and this is my big problem/ reason for writing this: In peaceful mode I got my pop up to about 230 and now whenever I load up the game and open that map the game crashes. Before when I was at a pop of like 190 I noticed things got laggy, then I feel asleep again, woke up, turned the game off (saved and all) and now I cannot get back into my file. \n\nI checked out the whats next on 1.9 and all, roads can wait. Games like these gave to have a large pop cap on them, it's the whole point in doing a game like this. The goal and over all satasfiaction with something like this is seeing that your once 32 pop village a now 320 pop city!\n\nOverall, it's a fun game and I'm really looking forward for future development.

I can be playing hours and hours without getting bored, and because of the updates, I get to play with new features.\n\nAnother thing I love about the game, is the game modes: skirmish and world map. You can play the classic skirmish, where you play in one map, or you can play in the world map, where you get access to a world with different maps. In world map mode, you have access to the limbo, where you can store villagers and resources. The game also features a tip system, magic towers, resource gathering... And the main purpose of survival mode: defending your village from the monsters and keeping your villagers alive (Or watching your willagers harvesting food in peaceful mode...)\n\nI guarantee you won't get bored with this game, and I recommend buying it.

I guess I would say that it's something of a god-sim mixed with a city-building sim. Nothing too outside the box, generally speaking.\n\nWhat else can I really say? My little men and women run about the world, mating and harvesting and mating some more (and stopping to chat all the damn time), and I continue to direct them to build stone walls, fire towers, and refining facilities. There's not much more to it at this point. However, that's due to the fact that the game is still in early access rather than any lack of vision on the part of the developers. I can see that there is a lot of room to grow in Retro-Pixel Castles and I have high hopes that the devs will continue to utilize that space.\n\nThe tutorials cover most everything you will need to know (not everything, of course, but they're tutorials - not strategy guides. I feel like there should be some information left to the player to discover). It's not difficult to figure out how to get a thriving community up and running once you understand the basic build order.\n\nI guess that would be one of my main complaints about the game (and there aren't too many complaints I could actually list - see the end of the review for my short list): once you understand the basic build order of the game there isn't very much in the way of challenge with attaining a thriving community. It seems like the game is, so far, simple and easy. This can be changed further on in development, and I feel like with the addition of more content the challenge rating should rise decently.\n\nSince pro/con lists seem to be all the rage in reviews, I will use one now. This list is not exhaustive.\n\nPros:\n+Easy to learn mechanics\n+Enjoyable and open-ended simulation\n+Pleasing graphical elements\n+Entertaining gameplay\n\nCons:\n-Soundtrack gets repetitive\n-It can be a bit of a hassle figuring out which unit is your villager and which is the monster in a large melee\n-Small amount of content at this point\n-Lack of effective late-game purpose (once I've built all the buildings and made my havens safe for my townsfolk there isn't any reason to continue except to raise a large population in order to populate more areas of the map)\n\nI want to make a note that I feel like all of the cons so listed are easily fixed and I have a good feeling that the devs are either currently working towards those goals or will soon begin to do so.\n\nI won't waste any time attempting to offer my thoughts as to how to fix said cons - this is simply a review.\n\nAnyway, without going on too long (too late) I would have to say this: if you're a fan of god sims or city building sims then you should definitely keep an eye on this game. With a few more updates I think it could easily become a mainstay of your gaming repertoire.

I want to get back to it every second I have free time, even though I have already lost...how many was it...5 villages in only 8 hours? I seem to not be the best deity for these people...\n\nThis game captivates you with its unique design and the music in the background only further emphasizes this--I feel as if I were transported back in time to when these villagers lived.\n\nPerhaps one of the best parts of this game is that it give you a very brief intro, and then throws you into the game with only the most basic knowledge--trial and error is essential to this. Not only do you consider how to manage/assign your villagers, but you also have to consider building priorities, landscape, potential areas of threat from monsters, and of course, managing your resources.\n\nIn considering any downsides, the one thing I might have an issue with is that often times when I want to hover my mouse over a fight between my servants (ha) and the monsters, all I am able to see is a health bar of one person, especially if multiple entities are in the same square. All I really want is to make sure my people's health bars are still doing well. Maybe add some sort of way to view the villagers\u2019' health bars outside of hovering the mouse over them?\n\nAll in all, great game, and I will continue to try to prevent the total and inevitable destruction of my people!", "timestamp_created": 1456433674, "timestamp_updated": 1456433674, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "21385414": {"recommendationid": "21385414", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040491172", "num_games_owned": 85, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 784, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483708198}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc774\uac8c\uc784\uc740 \uc883\uac19\uc774 \uc5b4\ub835\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4 \uadf8\ub7ec\ubbc0\ub85c \uc0ac\uc9c0\ub9c8\uc138\uc694~", "timestamp_created": 1456146782, "timestamp_updated": 1456146782, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.426357", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "21196039": {"recommendationid": "21196039", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971731711", "num_games_owned": 513, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 13854, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502563599}, "language": "english", "review": "Really liked this one :) Updates are pretty consistent too and it managed to draw me in playing! \nGood pick!", "timestamp_created": 1455419323, "timestamp_updated": 1455419323, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "21130006": {"recommendationid": "21130006", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066718659", "num_games_owned": 102, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1068, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1473581325}, "language": "english", "review": "Its a fun little build and defend game that can get quite hard if dont build defences in the first few days.

That being said there are various pros and cons with RPC\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n\n- Graphics: This is a more personally pro for me, but I love the graphics on this game. The retro style is easy on the eyes and it's not hard to differentiate various things. That being said, if you expect crazy graphics from this game, this ain't the game for you\n\n- Controls: The controls are very easy to learn and get used to. Granted, I would like more hotkeys for various buildings/spells but I'm sure that they'll be implemented later on. Nonetheless, the controls are easy to learn and master\n\n- UI: The information that you need are so easily presented/accessible that you can see whatever you want either immediately or with a few clicks\n\n- AI: Except for a few hicks, the AI is pretty solid. Your workers will prioritize the buildings without fail and your guards will defend as best as they can. There really hasn't been a point where I've raged because of silly AI\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n\n- Long Term Playability: The only real problem that I have with RPC is the lack of content in the late game. Once you're able to get to the late game harvesting buildings, there's really nothing else to do. However, I see this as a short term problem as this game is early access and from what I can gather from the dev's plans, this issue may be resolved\n\n- Difficulty: Similar to the problem above, once you get to the late game there really isn't anything that can threaten you. Is it impossible to fail, no. In fact, if there is a huge wave of monsters, you can and will fail through either poor management of spells or poor AI. However, as stated before this is mostly short term as this is early access and could be fixed through variety or increase in difficulty\n\n\n[b]Overall[/b]: RPC is a great game, its retro style graphics and simplistic menus can lead towards hours of enjoyable gameplay. However, the lack of late game buildings/progression as well as the lack of difficulty past the initial phase of gameplay does bring the game down a lot. There has been quite some times where I would be bored since there was no new goal for me to reach or no new threat for me to fear. However, if these issues were to be fixed, this game would be extremely enjoyable and challenging.\n", "timestamp_created": 1453682019, "timestamp_updated": 1453682019, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "20653629": {"recommendationid": "20653629", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118567102", "num_games_owned": 43, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 2907, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502846108}, "language": "english", "review": "This game was good till like 50 enemies swarmed my base.

Around day 7 things are going south fast. The game looks very promising, I have played, and failed repeatedly, I continue to enjoy seeing my own demise. Energy seems to be my biggest issue, You generate it extremely slowly farming crystals, and from enemy kills, but the difference between what you make and what it costs to kill a mob is considerable. I think that could use some balancing and maybe energy generation methods, I spammed the only building that is capable of producing power and even that didn't do the trick, they just run out so quickly. So all in all, I like the game, I think it will continue to get better as the Devs put more work into it. It plays like Gnomoria accept it's all above ground and you can't use the surroundings to protect yourelf (mobs hack through trees), However you have god powers and can interfere with what is going on to some extent, you can warp villiagers to safety or mobs away, but these are extremely expensive \"influence\" wise, this is the games form of mana, which is generated based on happiness. Fireballs are great, accept when you throw them into crowds of your villiagers because you panic when a hoarde of mobs get in...

villagers at too quick of a pace in survival mode and they are very heavy hitting. the healling doesnt seem to do much and it is quite difficult to keep food up even with two farms set up. overall i give this game a 8or9/10 and will give it an even better review when more updates are released. heres to many hours to come of endless fun.", "timestamp_created": 1447876732, "timestamp_updated":

As soon as you start getting your perfect setup of buildings, you start to get raped. I've only gotten to day 11, and thats with my last villager running with a couple hords gathered behind him. At about day 7, hordes of monsters will start to appear and there is no chance of survival. Its just depressing when you see them come in and hear the repeated sounds of slaughter. Even with three fire bolt towers constantly fueled at both of my entry points, monsters would still get through or just cause a massive heap of blood and flames that would consume anything that gets in it. It really sucks :( I know that its still in development, and I'm really excited for all of the stuff thats in the drawing board, but seriously this game becomes very frustrating at a certain point because there is nothing you can do about your villagers being brutally raped by the evil masses.\n\nSome suggestions:\n \nBuilding priority - some way to make sure that villagers will actually build the structures they set up. I've gotten very fed up with how they'll drop all the resources at the buliding, but then just forget about it even though its the only thing queued up to build. So a firebolt tower might be fully set with resources but won't actually be usable for a whole day or two because the villagers get distracted. Maybe make sure that as soon as the last one drops resources on the building, he starts to work on it. \n\nSpecific land motivation - instead of just motivating the land in a general circle, maybe motivate certain resources. Its annoying having to either destroy or wait for my villagers to eventually chop down all the trees around small patches of food that I want to expand. If you try to expand without doing this, the forested area will just overrun the food, making it useless. \n\nHealing aura towers - monsters are quite overpowered and they outnumber your villagers easily. It'd be nice to have a slight but steady flow of health to them in certain areas. So you could set up a couple towers near the points of regular conflict and it would give them a little flow of health. This, or just making the healing aura more powerful would work. After about day 8 you need to drop a minimum of two healing auras to even make a dent in the damage that monsters do to your villagers. Thus using up a lot of your influence. \n\nDifferentiating between friendlies and enemy health - maybe its just me, because i'm slightly colorblind, but I have a hard time telling the difference between the health bars when theres one of those massive heaps of blood and fire. It'd be cool if the health bars were drastically different in the color, or if a colorblind mode was added so you could have complementary colors, making them complete opposites. \n\nIn conclusion, this game is fucking awesome. When you get that flow of essence to your cullis gate, essence collectors, and firebolt towers... it just feels and looks amazing because theres all this power cycling through the map. Its a great way to show how everything is being fueled and refueled. After a successful night without any casualties, you feel like you did your godly job well. But its hard to get that job done because the people you rule are morons.

(especially since the 16x16 update)\n[*] Little bugs, and all that are found usually resvolved, good or bad, ray helps.\n[*] DRM Free\n[*] An also nice selection of enemies, and jobs, adds a good bit of depth.\n[*] Recent changes to the way things work has made the game a lot better IMO.\n[*] The new towers for defense have greatly improved playablity.\n[*] Ray's got some strange talent at making maps, and lots of them too, plus they all last ages so that's a good bit of fun.\n\nMost of the cons are minor, may not look that way by the amount of text but that's just cause of my choice of wording.\n\nCons:\n[*] The game is more-that-slightly-less-than-rather intensive, but that's not bad coding, it's just the particles are everywhere.\n[*] No undo/redo in map editor, Most likely will be changed.\n[*] Can't rotate in map editor. Not sure if it will be changed because that might be on purpose.\n[*] Winter is perhaps a bit too hard to survive late game, but i've only gone into it once since the update.\n[*] The AI can be a little stupid, like often when i put enemies in forests they broke their way our, causing wood to drop on the floor and that was miles away, my people then go to pick it up.

I'd try starting it up and it crashed time and time again.\nFast forward a few months, I get a different computer and a new nVidia graphics card. I realize that I can run the game, and am quick to download and play it. I come back to InDev 14, and wow was it a joy. \n\nI essentially rediscovered the game, and so much had changed and been added to the development, that I was playing a very fresh game. I think that the fun of watching the game grow has been the best part of Retro-Pixel Castles so far, because it is a good game, and it has a lot of potential that I'm seeing put to use.

Even the few objects seem to be \"permutations\" of each other an contain functions of other buildings. I personally did not like that it seems to be rather \"fighting\" based (zombies etc.) and  i would rather like to see economy of my village grow and spend more time on that... As i said, the idea looks nice but i would have it rather in the dwarf fortress direction (which is rather based in economy than fighting). I did not want to bash your game and will definitely come back to reevaluate it, but currently i would not recommend it, because everyting seems rather limited and not like its worth 10 bucks. No offense but currently i would say that there are free games that give you the same fun and depth and the game rather seems like something you would get for free on a pc-magazine (back in the old days when they gave you CDs with it). An example that would be comparable from the style is clonk which is roughly 10 years old ! Another (also free) example is the latter named dwarf fortress which seems like 10 time the depth of this game.\n\nI know that it is hard to develop a game and please dont get this review wrong ! But if you sell a product for money you have to stand up for it no matter if its early access. And my personal opinion is, that in early access the product should not develop much from the content, but early access is for getting the flaws and small bugs out of the game. Not to actually develop it. I know that most game developers do it like this, which does not make it right. This particular game has a lot of potential, but currently i would not spend money on this.\n\nIts easy to only beef about something without giving advice on how i would like to see it develop. An example: Crepper world evermore. The first two parts were completely free and the third part came to steam without any early access thing and for a decent price. \n\nI personally experience it as a ripoff if the content of the game is developed in the (paid) early access since that is not what it is about. The early access is for fine-tuning the game and get some feedback from the comunity. Its about giving the game its last 5-10% not its last 50%. \n\nSorry that all of my all of my bottled-up displeasure about seemingly half-ready games got into this review.

A lot of dev work has happened. At this point, I have no intention of revisiting the game, but I did spend the time originally to play and review, so my review stands. Such can be a consequence of long development cycles, and releasing software early. [/i]\n\n---\n\n\nI *love* citybuilders and population managers. I think [i]Gnomoria[/i] and [i]Banished[/i] are two of my most played games on Steam with about 60 and 30 hours respectively. I put about 40 hours into [i]Dwarf Fortress[/i], and quite enjoyed it. While [i]RPC[/i] desperately wants to be like these titles, it is very far off - in a bad way.\n\n[b]First thing everybody should know is that there is no below-ground mining.[/b] Your world consists of a small-ish 'asteroid' that is one layer of ground thick, floating in space. There are frequent areas of the map that are just 'holes' where you can see the space behind the one-layer thick ground. I am certain that this strange mechanism is a result of limited money/resources/programming ability (idk), and was not intended. [b]The allure of the games cited as inspiration (listed in first paragraph) was largely because you could take 'stuff' out of the ground and organize it above ground! When you take that away, I am significantly less interested.[/b]\n\n[b]You cannot rotate buildings because it would take too much effort to redraw the images.[/b] I get it - prioritize developement, but this is something very basic that needs to be mentioned. It further hints at where this game is going. I would imagine these images could be done in a long weekend, am I right? I am not trying to be harsh, but potential buyers need to be aware of these things.\n\nThese are the main two issues I have but there are a myriad of others such as map and individual person custimazation that I will not go into fully.There are also very few buildings at this point. [b]Otherwise the music is quite good, and the artwork is pretty cool.[/b] This game probably was released on Early Access [i]a bit too early.[/i] I got it for half price, and am fine with it because I want to try any and all citybuilders/population managers. \n\n[b]To my Steam friends: if you haven't played [i]Gnomoria[/i] or [i]Banished[/i] yet, go for those![/b] If you are like me and have exhausted those, this *might* quench your thirst for a bit.\n\nI don't believe any of the issues I put forth will be resolved (I mean its one guy working on this), but if they are, I will alter my review.

It only had 3 or so ressources, awkward villager management and not many things to build. I was constantly overrun by zombies, there was little balancing.\n\n[h1]Now that I\u00b4m writing this review[/h1]\nOver the past weeks the game has been updated on a regular basis, bugs fixed and content added. The community is being involved in the developement process.\nThe game has a much more differentiated interface and villager statistics. A ressource refinement system has been added, the magic ressource 'crystal' is now usable and powers some of your buildings. The balancing has improved a lot in a way that you actually have a chance to survive. Monsters have been added and others balanced. Most of the ressources are renewable now. You can already call it a game at this point, it is playable up to end-game without major disruptions in the gameplay.\n\n[h1]What to expect from this game[/h1]You get an indie survival game with tower defense as well as rpg elements. Build up your medieval fantasy village and try to survive the neverending undead onslaught.\n\nStill being early access, the game has a lot of potential to go in many directions.\nMore towers could be added, like electric or acid, dealing splash/aoe damage, or to target specific monsters with weaknesses to certain damage types.\nA crafting system could be added to bring out the rpg side, allowing armor and weapons, or a profession system like warriors, mages, archers.\n\nWhat I\u00b4d really like to see are more maps. Maybe a community map contest?\n\n[h1]Pricing[/h1]\nAt the current stage, being in early access, I find the price a bit high, since the user doesn\u00b4t get the finished game yet.

He is always looking from new crashes to take care of (the stable release is pretty stable now. 5/15/16).  He is an indie dev making a good little game.  He is indeed the developer who listens to you.  Take a look at the discussion board and you will see he has responses on the majority of threads.\n\nAs far as game development goes, there have been significant and continual changes in the last year.  Every aspect of the game has matured.  More god powers.  Monster spawns are different.  Monsters will break down walls if they can't find a way in.  There are many more tower types than before.  there are now seasons.  There is a \"full map\", which lets you take stuff from one village to help with or start another if you survive long enough to prosper. ;)\n\nGame Review:\nVery fun little game.  The best way I can describe it is a God/tower defense village sim.  The game is similar to Banished in some aspects, but with the outside threat of the Undead.  It shares some aspects of Majesty as well.  It is a race against time to try and stay safe while the zombies and skeletons spawn (the monster spawning is going through some big changes in the current cycles so I left this a bit vague).\n\nYou don't have direct control of your guys which can lead to some hilarious situations; where someone runs from a zombie away from defense towers and deeper into trouble, or circles around a barricade to try and get that lump of stone that was dropped on the wrong side of the wall, etc.  A \"grab\" God power has been added so you can take care of some of these problems... if you are there to see it.\n\n\nIf you like Banished and tower defense games, or just want some good liero-style blood, this game is worth picking up, especially if it's on sale.  *Read what the dev has to say about the early access game before you purchase.*\n\n\nOh, and if you are looking for a god game this is so much better than Godus it's not even funny.\n\nedit: Updating review to current build - 1 year since purchase and I'm still enjoying the game.

(2/1/2015 - Current Ver: Indev12c, Indev13 roadmap announced)\n\nI'm recommending this, but I have a few caveats before I get to my review. If you're expecting a game that is 100% or even 80% realized as of (2/1/2015) then you probably haven't had much experience with Early Access and you probably shouldn't buy this game YET. Or if the feedback-and-support thing doesn't appeal to you, the $15 pricetag might seem a bit steep. Even then, if you're afraid of vaporware (I know I am), read the store page thoroughly as Ray (the dev) has done his best to put your fears to rest. Still mistrusting? I'm here for ya, or go to the website (or any of the links provided on the store page) and form your own opinion [url=http://retropixelcastles.com/index.php?/page/index.html]Official Website[/url](main website link on store page seems to be broken). I know it's some extra effort than you would normally spend, but Ray is very active on his official forums and he will certainly answer any questions regarding his vision and the current state of development before you make a decision on purchasing.\n\nThat said, I feel with the risk of vaporware and rushed products, opinion on the dev in an Early Access review is just as important as the game itself and I'll address that with my opinion first. If you don't care, scroll down and read the game portion. I'll remove this once the game goes Full-Access.\n\n[h1]Review of Indie Developer Raymond Doerr[/h1](scroll down for game review)\n\nThis man has earned my respect among a slew of Indie \"Developers\" (Opportunists) that started with Minecraft (Jeb had made a lot of promises like our Alpha/Beta contributions entitling us to free Xbox copies before it was so popular -- didn't happen) and continues to this day with practically every Early Access game on Steam. So much so I've learned to type the simple little word \"dev\" with a bit of spite in my mental voice. Ray is not that man. While this is an opinion, and one I cannot garuntee in the future, I very strongly feel this way. Just talk to him, you'll see.\n\nLittle things like his naming of his updates Indev12-13 versus 0.12.02 (this is no race to the magic 1.0! it's just a progress report) to his efforts to ask/require your input and support when so many people are so rightfully afraid to give it through an otherwise legitimate manner set him apart.\n\nWhen I was younger, Independently-Developed games were practically non-existent. To be a Beta Tester, you had to send in a resume to a big name company and you had to be hired, it was a job, before your voice ever mattered in the gaming world. I have a job so that's not an option, but through Ray and his SixtyGig Games (and with $15) my voice is heard. That is what Early Access, Independently-Developed games, and Raymond Doerr is all about.\n\n(had to be cut short for the actual game review, the lengthy praise is warranted though, I f-ing hate vaporware and the only way around it are honest reviews)\n\n[h1]Review of Retro-Pixel Castles[/h1][b]Current Version: Indev12c[/b]\n(Pro/Con lists are not my style, hope you like to read)\n\n[b]Influences[/b]\nOn the Steam Store Page, the game is marked as having several noticable influences, but in its current version, I mainly  agree with three of them, and I'll try to break them down.\n\n[b]Dwarf Fortress:[/b] This is the most obvious influence in my opinion (and also the closest game to ever touch upon what I want in a DF-like game), You have practically zero control over your villagers. You can place buildings to be constructed when your villagers get to it (although in a generally predictable manner), set resource harvesting tasks, and assign free (random) villagers to work at certain buildings. That's about it for control right now, and where most of the DF influence stops. P.S. \"Losing is Fun!\" theme is well-intact in Retro-Pixel Castles.\n\n[b]Banished:[/b] You start the game on whatever map you choose with nothing but a bunch of villagers and are free to choose where you place your Village Center (required before you can build anything else and serves as radial zone for where you can place other buildings at first, so choose wisely!), unless someone (or you!) has made a map where the Village Center was already placed (you only get one, this ain't no 4x). Also, when you build your first farm, you have to collect wild food (carrots only, so far) before they can start growing them in the farm (this is a one-time deal, a working farm can populate a new one). While it is ultimately a village sim and has buildings, food/energy requirements, I'd end the tracable influences to Banished there.\n\n[b]Tower Defense:[/b] This is a big one, as it encompasses the actual challenge of the game. I spend most of my time on Peaceful, because I'm a casual grow-and-love city builder type gamer, but this is one of the rare few games where I'll switch off peaceful and play the regular game because A) Peaceful at this stage is -super- low on content and extremely easy being locked on Day 1 difficulty (you really only need/will ever use 2-4 of the available building types) B) Instead of devoting my city to raising a military, in Tower Defense style, your buildings do most of the work for you (your villagers will fight mobs, dumbly, and you will lose a lot of them, but that's the point! \"Losing is Fun!\"). Also, currently, you get to have one save, per mode, per map, per profile (you really only need one profile, unless you have a family or RL friends -scoff-) so I can come back to my peaceful cities when I want. So far (more buildings planned in the next update, expect this to change), the only offensive building is a Fire Tower (you can also build walls for defense/mob funneling) which will TD-style automatically fire at mobs close enough. All living things die in a burst of pixelated blood and green \"essence\" which serves as mana/power for your Fire Tower (and an Essence Collector, which is essentially a battery for the Fire Tower). Every day that you survive, the rate that mobs appear increases, and so the difficulty.\n\nMost of the game and its mechanics are covered above.\n\n[b]Atmosphere:[/b]\n[b]Pixels!:[/b] At this point, you either love pixel-art or hate it. If you love it, this game does it very well. There's even an option to smooth out some of the pixel animation like essence flowing to an Essence Collector/Fire Tower(which looks gorgeous and well-fantasy-themed even for pixels), but I like pixels so I haven't even bothered. I'll edit this next time I go into the game and look (which may not be til the next update).\n\n[b]Music/Sound:[/b] Music is a nice, calming fantasy-like tune that fits well into the pixel-art world. I've never had to turn it down or off after several hours, but that's really all I have to say about it, as I tend to not notice game music anyways. Sounds come mainly from birth/death of villagers and are just a quick happy or sad tune that fits with the music-style.\n\n[b]Maps:[/b]\n[b]You can make your own maps![/b] Saved in whatever, and however many, folders you'd like. Ray is currently not very focused on (or very impressive at - sorry man) making maps for the game himself, which brings me to a special point.\n[b]If you buy Early Access and you make a good map and post it on his forum, Ray may add your map to the game before final release![/b] This is, as far as it stands now, an Early-Access-Only feature. I've seen those threads pop up, and I've seen maps get added, and updated. Be a real contributor to the game!\nMaps are 1-z level (no digging down DF fans, these are humans!) but give a vague impression of depth as dense resources appear \"taller\" than their regular counterparts and is a nice touch to the aesthetic without complicated mechanics needed.\nCurrently, Ray is experimenting with map size in an effort to reduce code/program efficiency, so if you get in now, there might be changes.", "timestamp_created": 1422870773, "timestamp_updated": 1422870885, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.647700", "comment_count": "8", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "14196549": {"recommendationid": "14196549", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057812873", "num_games_owned": 91, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 5086, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507753094}, "language": "english", "review": "Even though its still in development, this game is very fun and entertaining.\nSome reasons its a good game:\n-YOU can MAKE your own MAPS\n-Multiple types of gamemode choices (it looks like there will be 4, but when i write this its only 2)\n-Its only early acces, and its still an exellent quality game.\n-You have a \"preparation time\" when you start the map (Enemys slowly start apearing more)\n-Multiple maps to choose from\n-In a map your people always spawn in a different location than last time.\n-And theres more but im not listing all of it\n\n\nOnly bad thing i noticed is that it has a small chance of crashing when saving your game (Still saves even if it crashes) if your computers lagging.\n\nIn the end I completely reccomend this game", "timestamp_created": 1422386031, "timestamp_updated": 1422386031, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.544881", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "14173686": {"recommendationid": "14173686", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072321128", "num_games_owned": 9, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 6916, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503859776}, "language": "english", "review": "A fun game, highly recommend it.

Towers can't even seem to fire over walls which is major source of annoyance...

Yes they will run away but that only lasts a couple steps and then they will see a zombie and run and attack, it's a game of ping pong now with the run, attack, run, attack action... the game really needs a way to contain the villagers, either walls with gates or a \"no go\" zone that you can mark villagers to not cross.\n\nDefence buildings are useless, zombies heal faster then the buildings can regenerate, spawn faster then the buildings can regenerate and it appears the more you build, the more zombies you bring.\n\nOnce you mark a building to be built you can't pause it (Being worked on but the button doesn't work still), you can't lower it in the queue and you can't cancel it, you can only dismantle it, instant if nothing was delivered to the building, but if the building had even 1 item delivered to it a builder has to go to the building to dismantle it... \n\nLooking forward to the next patch but the game is still too unbalanced to be enjoyable", "timestamp_created": 1422119484, "timestamp_updated": 1425782965, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.534042", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "14141646": {"recommendationid": "14141646", "author": {"steamid": "76561198109697266", "num_games_owned": 90, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 502, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486477724}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041b\u044e\u0431\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044f\u043c \u043f\u0438\u043a\u0441\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0439 \u043f\u043e\u043d\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0441\u044f!  \u0418\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0432 \u0436\u0430\u043d\u0440\u0435 \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0433\u0438\u044f.", "timestamp_created": 1422099666, "timestamp_updated": 1422099666, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.468610", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "13956798": {"recommendationid": "13956798", "author": {"steamid": "76561198109042062", "num_games_owned": 93, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2347, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508343761}, "language": "swedish", "review": "its one of the better games i play wen it was new i did not likit but som updates later i started to love it i recomend it if you like medivel games and retro stile games its a good game over all", "timestamp_created": 1421071344, "timestamp_updated": 1508176097, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.472272", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "13952356": {"recommendationid": "13952356", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016045568", "num_games_owned": 671, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 641, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1460559774}, "language": "schinese", "review": "indev17\n\u8fd9\u6e38\u620f\u5df2\u7ecf\u6ca1\u6551\u4e86\uff0c\u4e00\u5e74\u4e86\u8fd8\u8fd9\u6837\u3002\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edd\u5927\u591a\u6570\u65f6\u95f4\u90fd\u5728\u201c\u770b\u201d\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u201c\u73a9\u201d\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u4f60\u559c\u6b22\u5417\uff1f \u867d\u7136\u7ed9\u7684\u662f\u63a8\u8350\u4f46\u4e0d\u63a8\u8350\u8d2d\u4e70\uff0c\u5373\u4fbf\u6253\u6298", "timestamp_created": 1421033480, "timestamp_updated": 1448936330, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "13929702": {"recommendationid": "13929702", "author": {"steamid": "76561198113328742", "num_games_owned": 118, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 564, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1449441057}, "language": "english", "review": "*Enters game* *Tries to figure out how to make more villagers* *A child is born* *Tears of joy* *He gets brutally eaten by zombies while the rest of the villagers are gathering wood and collecting stone*", "timestamp_created": 1420919365, "timestamp_updated": 1420919365, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 14, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525076", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "13914091": {"recommendationid": "13914091", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037448294", "num_games_owned": 182, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1017, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1440438641}, "language": "english", "review": "slow pacing town simulation, \"Lemmings + Banished\".

Like other tribes trying to kill my people or simply wild animals. Banished couldnt fulfill this wish but Retro Pixel Castles does. Although till now it is limited to Slimes and Zombies (more to come).\nObviously it is Early Access and not finished, it is in many ways very barebone, has at the moment no saving function (end 2014) and misses many other things in terms of controls, layout and look.\nBut it also is very playable i have to say. There is something you can get out and giving you some fun. Maps are available from the developer (although they are a bit ugly) or you get a community created map (looking much better).\nSteamworkshop is missing till now, which makes these a bit \"harder\" to obtain, but they are there.\n\nThe game goes a similar direction Banished goes. You start with a bunch of people, you create a Towncenter, harvest ressources and build other buildings to support your people or get defenses against Monsters up.\nYou cant control your people directly, which often is a bit painful because you also cant give other commands like a rallye point or make a priority to a building, so you cant influence till now which building they start to build or where they shall group up to fight and defend their town. Also a more direct control over single townsmen/women would be a good addition to decide who is going to be a builder and who will be a farmer (or maybe a guard later on?).\n\nBut even while there are things missing and flaws at the moment, it is very fun to play. Different maps give a good feeling of what the Dev can come up with and besides that spice the experience up. Playing on one map is very different than on the next one. Even playing several times on the same map is a variety in experience because the starting points are randomized.\n\nCurrently in: \n-are different basic buildings like a farm, different kinds of housing (tent and house), lighting, defensetowers, walls, structures to earn ressources\n-a mapeditor to create your own maps (is kinda easy, just the dev is doing some very ugly ones)\n-different profile without any use at the moment\n-a settings option menu\n-2 types of monsters (zombie and slime)\n-1 type of food\n-2 types of usable ressources (stone and wood)\n-3 types of non usable ressources at the moment (3 different crystaltypes)\n-a kinda good soundtrack (sounds very pixely)\n-a very sweet pixel look, zoomable camera (although a bit clunky in performance then)\n\nNote: you can enter a beta branch with going to properties of the game, which gives you access to a \"unstable\" version of the game with more features. I highly recommend  to do this, i experienced no crashes on the unstable compared to the basic version which crashed often and got more content from it.\nHow to do this is described on the forum.\nMy review is based of the Unstable Version 2 InDev12 on the Beta Branch.\n\nI can recommend this game as an early access game. Even unfinished it is very playable and has enough content to get fun out of it and be creative with the editor to get even more challenge or just experiment.\nI bought it for 7.49\u20ac and i think it was worth the price. I think 15\u20ac are a bit much for the content at the moment and if you want to wait till it gets cheaper or has more content, then wait.\nBut i think it will definetely be worth this price tag with a bit more content or even when its finished and for an Early Access Game, it delivers more than others do. \nIts one of the good Early Access Games.", "timestamp_created": 1419854361, "timestamp_updated": 1419854361, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493213", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "13623866": {"recommendationid": "13623866", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018061433", "num_games_owned": 1226, "num_reviews": 1265, "playtime_forever": 56, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490619301}, "language": "german", "review": "2014 als es im Early Access Modus erschienen ist, war ich nicht begeistert, da noch nicht viel gestimmt hat.

I suspect I need to wall myself in, and funnel the zombies to a well defended hole before expanding... something I will try in coming days.

Right now there's no \"ongoing\" challenge - in many games of this genre, growth brings new problems (or revisitations of the old). I'm extremely interested to see how that will go, as everything here so far is rock solid and ongoing steady challenge is the only \"thing\" that prevents this becoming a time consuming pastime.

Is liek Mincraft but so many more features like a the game goes to nighttime after it is daytime for so long. and you have to get things like wood and stone unlike minecraft were you just punch things. this gaem is super realistic. it has features like blood and water but its not just blood. like it spreads its cool..\n\nCongratulations, you read what it would look like if a 12 year old wrote a review for this game. I will now enlighten you with my actual review. For the record, this is build 10-31-2014. Currently this game is very limited in the features. Before you ever start a game it lets you know that there is just the core game to play with a few things added. You have some maps to pick between, some of them are test maps which narrows down the \"usuable\" maps even further. When you start, you get 24 villagers and have to build your village center. To do this, you must collect wood and stone from nearby sources. Once the village center is completed you gain access to more buildings; however, this too is extremely limited. You can build storage for food, wood, and stone. There are three different sizes of houses you can build, two sizes of farms, torches for light and walls.  Walls currently serve no purpose other than to look cool and to really make that retro looking pixelated castle feel that you wanted when you bought this game.  The villagers will marry and have children which causes the need for more food and shelter. This may feel slow and boring but once you start getting around 90-100 villagers it becomes more demanding. I managed to get over 410 villagers but due to lag and food shortages, the best i could do was simply let people start dying. Despite the numerous deaths, the villagers, or vermin, were breeding out of control and continually increased in numbers until my game crashed-- it is early access after all. Currently the game simulated building a colony and watching them thrive or spew blood across the canvas as they starve to death due to your incompetence as a pathetic god figure.  Either way, this game is already fun in its current state and if what they already have announced as future plans are promises and not just ideas that are never implemented, this game will only ever get better and I anticipate its official launch.  All I ask is that saves are added so my vermin(oops, I mean, people) infested islands can be saved before the villagers feel the wrath of torment of not only being starved to death in the midst of a famine, but instead, the excruciating pain of being.... deleted.", "timestamp_created": 1414885143, "timestamp_updated": 1414885143, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0,

With several variations for each object or tile, nothing in the map looks quite like the copy-and-paste wireframe you usually expect to see in other 2D pixel games. Down to the last blade of grass, there seems to be a nice variety of different shades, shapes and directions each individual block displays - with every texture having a decorative secondary layer for its own material type. Complementing the game's surprisingly vibrant and lively textures is an amazing, hand-crafted lighting system ruled over by some of the other textures and objects, and a fully functional day-and-night cycle. Torches provide a light source, lava illuminates a small radius of land around it, and crystals glow in the dark like fireflies. Every wall and object has a dynamic and intricate reaction to which direction the sun is in relation to the world below (as well as other light sources), which changes gradually as the day cycle goes by. Even the water shines in the night as the moon reflects down on it! \n\nWhile this may not sound like much to most modern gamers, for a pixel-based game, the way this is handled is extremely impressive, and adds a clever illusion of 3D with a very nice shadow system. Even some of the world textures are crafted with certain curves around the edges and changes of width that add a realistic sense of direction and angle. This is most visible in the game's own main menu, with the stone-brick wall trim which boxes us in the game's window. \n\nThe game currently is still in a very early alpha stage and offers no enemies or immediate dangers beyond the starvation of your villagers who wander around aimlessly like hilarious morons until you lay out the foundation for a town hall and send out vague and indirect orders for different resources - a feature true to its own advertisement. This game is definitely no standard RTS, as you have much less control over what happens within the world, instead treating the villagers like ants in an antfarm. You give them basic instructions and a general goal in life, and they immediately begin deciding amongst themselves who works where and who gathers or builds what. \n\nVillagers marry and house themselves independently (assuming there had already been homes built, by your command) and have their own unique set of attributes such as Strength and Dexterity, which increase depending on how hard they work or how long they travel. If they are over-worked or if a spouse dies, a villager will become extremely depressed, and lose the will and the energy to continue working at full capacity for a short period of time. Eventually, the villager will find relief in rest or another lover, and so will continue on with his or her life.  \n\nThe lack of direct control over your villagers is a very welcome and unique change of flow from your average city-building sim, as it gives you a very relaxed and non-competitive or war-driven experience. While I'm sure more threats will be introduced further down the line, the general concept of the game so far is very interesting and humble. I personally have never seen a game concept quite like this, and despite my lack of interest in pixel-based games, I found this quite enjoyable. Even with its current lack of content. \n\nThis is still a very early build, with a lot of features and content to be added as time goes by. As for right now though, in the state it's in at the time, it comes with a refreshing breath of life in the world of sandbox sims.  Where other games force linear and challenging objectives  or goals, this game's only real objective is survival, and determining how to best accomplish this, with strategy. The gameplay itself reminds me somewhat of Lemmings and Black & White, two gems from Lionhead Studios and Team17. One an objective-based RTS sim where you give general orders to minions in order to help them escape a maze, and the other a god-game where you do your best to keep a strong and stable economy and gain control over other villages. All in all, Retro-Pixel Castles comes with an /exceptionally/ nice soundtrack which really helps set the mood and clear the mind, and a surprising amount of detail and clarity in its world textures which promises a great deal of polish in the final product. The lighting and 3D-like illusions shown in 2D textures makes the game almost remind me a little of Don't Starve, with its ability to turn a simple 2D world into something more like a pop-out storybook. To know that all this comes from such a small dev team is very thrilling, and I would definitely like to see what direction this project takes in the future. \n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1414552278, "timestamp_updated": 1414552278, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 28, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.691903", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "12664027": {"recommendationid": "12664027", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002734128", "num_games_owned": 1900, "num_reviews": 338, "playtime_forever": 689, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508278476}, "language": "english", "review": "\"Retro-Pixel Castles\" is a village simulator that is a bit rogue-like in the sense that you'll be trying to grow and prosper your town for as long as you can before your little uncontrollable villagers succumb to whatever hellish death awaits them.

I found this system strangely enjoyable. Workers at the start work as a giant collective until you start to produce more building to seperate them with jobs. Your people have relationships and gain skills based on the work they have done and I found the short time I spent with this game simply great.\nI will update this review once I've played a decent amount of time on the latest release. \nI will also be looking into making some videos on this game now it is released to steam. \nI have one video currently avilable from Retro-Pixel Castles Tech demo here - http://youtu.be/NEk0M0PmJa4", "timestamp_created": 1414435198, "timestamp_updated": 1414435198, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.553847", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "12657178": {"recommendationid": "12657178", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999709326", "num_games_owned": 239, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 901, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479385751}, "language": "english", "review": "Edited on Jan 29 2015\n\nSo this game has been updated, and i've been asked to check the game out again since there is now more content, and this does TECHNICALLY qualify as an early version of the game, rather than simply being a tech demo as it originally was, dumped on steam with no warning that the game wasn't practically playable any more than starcraft 2 with only command centers and scv's would be.\n\nBut i'm not impressed. My problems with this game comes down to \n\n - Terrible \"village management\"\n - Sketchy bussiness practice, not necessarily malignant, but the dev is inexperienced and it shows\n - Lack of direction\n - There is no way to make interesting maps (All current ones are garbage)\n - Even at 10\u20ac the game is heavily overpriced\n\nI don't want to go into little bugs and irritants, although they are not in short supply, this is early access and these are expected, but the above problems aren't something you can fix with a little patch, they require major reworkings of the game or the way the development operates.\n\nBy far the biggest issue here is the way new villagers are aquired; the game borrows the double dumbass approach of towns where you will only reproduce if your people are happy AND your people will only be happy if they aren't doing anything. I really didn't want to add this sentence but if you look in the comments for this review it's obvious i'm going to get called on it if i don't so yes, technically you CAN aquire new citizens even at 0 happiness, but the odds of that happening are so abysmally low, i've played 4 games now and i've seen 1 new person appear at <25 happiness, so it doesn't matter.\n\nThis is made far worse by the game's approach to combat. I expect combat to change a lot as new features are planned for it, but it is still taking the approach of high volatility combat; you're going to lose people defending your home. Compare this to Towns and Dwarf Fortress; in towns you also have this stupid villager approach to population growth, but you're very unlikely to lose people in combat, so it doesn't completely shut down your village even if you're frequently in combat. Dwarf fortress has frequent, massive genocides with scores of dead characters, but population growth is tied to the value of all items your fort owns, and looting enemies gives you lots of weapons, armor and clothes of good value, so you typically get lots of new migrants coming in to refill the ranks of your military.\n\nThis game has you attacked about every 30 seconds right now, there is practically no breathing room, and it starts immediately. The game seems more like an RTS than a village sim, but with an extremely slow process of replenishing your forces. This could work in the same ways as custom maps for starcraft and warcraft have done, which was awesome, but when you can't expand your population you're just stuck, unable to do anything.\n\nTying happiness to idling is another total failure for the game, especially with the constant aggression. You basically turn the whole game into ballancing workload vs free time; too little workload and you won't be able to build the defenses, too much workload and you never get enough people. This could work as a component to the game, but it just becomes the sole focus, and all you end up doing is unassigning and reassigning people in a neverending circle of tedius micromanagement.\n\nSpeaking of tedius micromanagement, the villagers are terrible at carrying out tasks efficiently. If you order too many houses/defenses/farms (read: more than 2) they'll start building the first house, then when it's halfway done, they apparently switch to the next, with just a few people working on the first. The result is a collage of unfinished structures littering your town, and if you're building defenses while they're being attacked, the builders will drop their materials to fight, then carry them of to the wrong building, leaving a single unfinished tower for up to 20 minutes was the worst i had, with the little idiots running back to pick up their wood, then drop it as a zombie got close, run over to punch the zombie, then pick up the wood and haul it to another tower under construction. (I queued 4 towers, silly me)\n\nThis isn't really a big issue to work around, just don't queue up constructions, right? Sure, but this is more micromanagement on top of giving builders their mandatory vacation time, and on top of the next issue:\n\nVillagers apparently gather resources from completely random places. This means if you're building something in one place and you assign them to gather wood/rocks nearby, they'll gather it there, but if you then build the next building somewhere else (Why would anyone want to keep their farms and defenses seperate...?) you have to unassign where to gather resources, or the idiots will run halfway across the map to chop down a tree, instead of the one assigned right next to them. \n\nAll this combined means you don't spend your time organizing defenses, planning your town or anything you'd expect from this game, you're just babysitting these idiotic villagers; go chop here, don't chop there, don't be a builder, don't mine there, mine here, be a builder, don't be a farmer, etc. etc. and this is what the game is; it takes hours to build anything because of this nonsense, and you need to leave the game running without building anything to get new villagers.\n\nThe other major issue with this as a village sim is that there are no different resources; just food and construction materials. Wood and stone are just different colours; no buildings/tools/tech needed for extraction, take the same time, trees don't regrow, what's the point?\n\nThe game's bussiness practice also smells bad. The game was initially kickstarted successfully, and IMMEDIATELY after that it was dumped on early access, despite being nothing more than an abysmal tech demo; no combat, just farms and houses forever; 30 minutes and the game ran out of things to do. My problem with this is how eager the dev is for cash. Why wasn't the kickstarter enough to at least make a functional game before throwing it out here? He'll happily charge full price for a tech demo, and the \"game\" has even been on sale. I hate old sayings, but \"Don't sell the skin before shooting the bear\" seems apt for once.\n\nThe other problem the dev has is the game's lack of focus. This game is NOT on early access to get feedback, because there are so many features missing it's practically impossible to give any worthwhile feedback. What the dev seems to want is ideas for where to take his game, and early access is a terrible place for that. Maybe you want a village sim and this turns into an RTS? Well then, jokes on you. It's impossible to satisfy everyone, but you're still charging them for it. Like i wrote at first, the game has elements of an RTS and a village sim as the dev advertises both on the store page and here: http://retropixelcastles.com/index.php?/page/key_features.html but they don't work together. You can't have the volatility of an RTS combined with the slow growth of a village sim; one has to dominate. The game also touts this \"inevitable failure\" part, as if it has any benefit; If you're building a village you want to see it grow and expand; what's the point of that if the village doesn't matter and you're just playing for high score? I don't mind the \"see how long you can last\" thing, but its fun in an RTS, where you build things only because of their immediate value to your survival, not in a village sim. \n\nApparently we're supposed to unlock stuff after we die, because grinding for necessary unlocks is everyone's favorite thing about videogames.\n\nThe game also claims to be \"unique\" which is nonsense; stronghold and majesty has done \"defend and grow village\" over a decade ago, and MUCH better. \n\nTL;DR: This is an RTS where all you can build is farms, houses and towers, and you can't control or replenish your units.", "timestamp_created": 1414423683, "timestamp_updated": 1422568297, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 161, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.579278", "comment_count": "36", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "12655104": {"recommendationid": "12655104", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971236263", "num_games_owned": 907, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 78, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2, "last_played": 1513537958}, "language": "french", "review": "Ce jeu semble int\u00e9ressant. \n\nLes d\u00e9veloppeurs r\u00e9pondent rapidement dans le forum Steam.\n\nLe management me semble simple pour le moment mais je n'y ai pas encore suffisament jou\u00e9 pour avoir un point de vue valable \u00e0 ce niveau.\n\nJ'aime le fait que chaque personnage du village aie un nom, un niveau, une 'vie'....

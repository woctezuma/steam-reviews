One of said gods is you, the player. You start the game with one creaure which depends on the class of god you choose to be. From there, the game walks you through the base mechanics and sets you off on your own to grind awy for hours on end. With over 600 unique creatures there is a ridiculous amount of diversity at the player's fingertips. It is important to note that this game has some crazy balancing, by that I mean that pretty much everything is capable of being OP if used in a correct combination. So, the game never forces you to go down one path in order to succeed. The choice is always yours. The story is very simple and straightforward. It personally doesn't bother me, but I definitely consider Siralim 2 to be plot driven. As for the graphics, I love them. I think they fit the game perfectly. They just add to the nostalgia while also not being sloppy. In terms of difficulty, most of the challenges you'll encounter in your adventure come from a need to level up to beat bosses or perhaps find a new team composition to clear realms quicker. As I stated before, anything can become OP when used correctly, so it is extremely fun to experiment with different creature combinations and team compositions. \nFor anyone that enjoys monster taming/catching games, I would definitely recommend that you buy this game. \nImportant Note: The devs actively respond and adapt to feedback from their community (via forums and discord as far as I know).", "timestamp_created": 1514232108, "timestamp_updated": 1514232108, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38322453": {"recommendationid": "38322453", "author": {"steamid": "76561198327133325", "num_games_owned": 300, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 4591, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 73, "last_played": 1513471365}, "language": "english", "review": "It's one of those games that might make you go \"I'll just traverse one more realm\" and then hours later you're still at it.

I mean its a demeanign way to describe any game but that is what it boils down too. I saw it thought it looked cool. Turn-based games are good and usually have good enough stories too carry you throught the experience. Here however we are hit with a story that is just busy work. People will be like you got a boss fight coming up so you better be careful but when u get there its a fight that is as easy as all the others.\nGameplay:\nOne thing that makes no sense is you fully heal at the end of every battle. Everything is restored after every battle...... like why? Seriously I'll be like oo shit I barely got out of that last fight hope I can get to the crystal to get out then an enemy will catch me and I'll be like oo shit for 1 second then see full hp on all my units. All that matters is a high speed stat and burst damage stupid me lol. Making a game where only one style works means you have made a bad JRPG(I call it this because its the most similar genre, plz forgive the offence). Also everything you do is all just grinding there is no purpose because......\n\nThe Story:\nThe story is jsut busy work. Hey go talk to Big Dick Rick. Hey thx for talking to me tutorial tutorial go talk to Cutie McBooty again. Thx for talking to Big Dick Rick now go kill the Eyeball Dog of Popsical Island on the fourth floor but be careful he is a toughie. ;3 Except replace the character names with like Steve and Jerry, call the monster an evil force, and just say the floor he is on. I'm sorry how am I to feel like I'm on some epic quest to stop the Evil Dingo from stealing an Australian's baby if you can't give me any colour to the situation? Like shit in two seconds I jsut brought up more interesting plot lines and characters tehn this game has. The real story is this bad guy coming, only you can stop him cause you are chosen one.\n\nAchievements:\nCongrats you farmed some, Congrats you farmed more. Congrats you have emptied the fucking planet of all useful resources and doomed its ecosystem. THOSE ARE THE ACHIEVEMENTS AND THEY ALL HAVE THE SAME PICTURE. Activate slow clap, flip two fingers up, and back away from this SHIT slowly. You have better things to do with your life.\n\nJust don't waste your time:\nPlay pokemon, play Skyrim, play with your dingleberries! All our more thought out and better made games then this and you do busy work in all 3. This game gets a 4 out of 10 for graphics and music being appealing, but the achievements being empty farming bs taht are all the same and unfullfilling, the story being non-existent, and the game being barely a game at all makes this not worth your money.

You begin by selecting from one of five types of mages: Life, Nature, Chaos, Sorcery, and Death. After a short introduction, you find yourself at your castle with lots of stuff to do. \n\nYou can teleport to a realm, which is a contained random map with enemies, treasures, and one of 15 gods with whom to gain favor. Gaining favor with the various gods gives various perks and access to new cores.\n\nCores can be extracted from most creatures, though there are some (such as those gained by earning favor with the gods) can only be purchased. From the beginning, you can only extract cores from the base creatures. Once you have bred or summoned a creature, you will be able to extract cores from creatures like it that you find in the wild. The creature count (with the expansion) is somewhere around 700 different creatures you can have (with no limits on how many of each).\n\nBreeding is done one of two ways. You can pick the parents yourself, or you can use recipes you have found while exploring realms. Breeding creatures gives them an increase in power, so even breeding two of the same creature together can be beneficial as they become more and more powerful. The only drawback to breeding is that you are limited by your Power Level, which is increased through combat and has a maximum of 200%, minimum of 20% (there are also fairies you can use to give you a boost to Power Level). Since breeding costs 50%, you can only breed three creatures before needing to increase your Power Level again. Still, it is lots of fun to breed new creatures and see them show up in the game world (where you can now capture their cores).\n\nThere are many more things to do, and with 40 hours in the game, I have only scratched the surface. You can craft artifacts to equip on your creatures and give them special boosts. There are many spell gems that can be equipped and modified with special bonuses (such as automatically being cast when your creature is hit). You can cook different foods to give special bonuses. Recruit villagers into your castle who give you various quests, along with a tailor who can craft costumes for you. Plus more.\n\nCombat is not just about dealing a lot of damage. Each creature has a trait which can greatly change the course of battle, so you will need to prepare for anything. I had to forfeit battle against a much weaker creature because my party could only deal physical damage, and this particular creature casts Shell on itself each time it takes damage. Shell prevents all damage from the next attack against it. If I had equipped a single damage spell, I would have been able to defeat it, but even my much stronger creatures were useless against it. \n\nThe bosses are also difficult and unique. I have only fought through to the 19th-level boss, which is difficult because it requires your party to be able to survive for a long time (unless you just happen to guess the correct combination). My \"all-powerful\" team of level 30+ struggled against this boss.", "timestamp_created": 1512664913, "timestamp_updated": 1512664913, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37822227": {"recommendationid": "37822227", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052514570", "num_games_owned": 144, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 692, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505157866}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the better monster/minion/ breed and battle Games I've played and not beaten because its so massive lots and lots of content and the story is good very good.

A fair and honestly developed indie game. I normally concentrate on basic to-and-fro combat stats in RPGs, but this game proves combat based entirely on obscure/minor special abilities interacting with each other can work.\n\nI didn't find it all that much fun though personally - and I can't put my finger on what I'd change. There is much here that is underdeveloped or even lazy - the ancient JRPG game engine makes looting, breeding and creature management tedious. The casual, mini-roguelike dungeons are a good idea - but it's too basic IMO. In a true roguelike, like Moria or Angband, the randomly generated corridors are a) tactically important and affect how you tackle the enemies, and b) much more random. In Siralim 2 you get a sequence of JRPG fights one after the other - the layout of the corridors doesn't matter, there is no sneaking, cover, or terrain bonuses - the procedural corridors are a time sink. Making the dungeons small though was a good move, as it means you can play this in 10-minute bursts.\n\nThe game world, music and atmosphere is completely lacking. 15 zones, each with a few lines of dialogue and a small selection of map tiles - they could have simplified them right down. The 5 creature classes are almost identical to Magic the Gathering (Life=White, Chaos=Red, Death=Black, Nature=Green, Sorcery=Blue), a bit lazy perhaps, and the game might be better without them.\n\nOther games have achieved more with the ancient JRPG format: through good graphic design and engaging writing. These things won't be of core interest to Siralim's players, but the lack of them, for me, highlighted problems with the \"bare bones\" mechanics of the combat. Two sets of six creatures face off - they have (probably) two special abilities each plus an assortment of spell gems that mostly auto-trigger. Fights can be really interesting when these abilities happen to connect up into long chains of effects all triggering each other. But the game doesn't actually show what hidden abilities the enemies have (which I suspected is due to the limitations of the engine more than a design choice) - so although the abilities are ingenious, and there are loads of them, and they are really well balanced, the actual experience of sitting playing this is like an early Final Fantasy game. Hold down the attack button, wake up if health is low or enemies' abilities seem to be linking up.\n\nThe developer is active. They have managed to balance hundreds of special abilities better than many professional games, so it deserves a recommendation. It might appeal to fans of Dominions IV. Hopefully they can find a way to make it multiplayer - the drawbacks wouldn't matter then, and it would make use of the truly colossal range of possible builds.", "timestamp_created": 1501955097, "timestamp_updated": 1501955097, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493843", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34031525": {"recommendationid": "34031525", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009932639", "num_games_owned": 164, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 6597, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 35, "last_played": 1513161379}, "language": "english", "review": "Looks like a small simple game, but its prity deep and complex. \nDev worth the 15$ ! \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1501913694, "timestamp_updated": 1501913694, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493746", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34025978": {"recommendationid": "34025978", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067007103", "num_games_owned": 101, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2010, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502656951}, "language": "english", "review": "Siralim 2 is the sucessor of the original game \"Siralim\" by Thylacine Studios.\n\nDont let the game discourage you to play it because of their graphics.

I think their purpose is to push your own limits in the game and not just mash E.  Critical thinking is big here)\n-Excellent Performance (no framerate issues, bugs, glitches that I've seen so far)\n-Excellent Developer (no bs here, they made a great game and are selling just that, no microtransactions, great customer support, great website FAQ, and interaction all around)\n\nTLDR: \nFantastic game that brings all of the Dragon Quest Monsters nostalgia and more!

I was drawn to these two games from a post on reddit when the first game was only a demo. I played & enjoyed the first game & was thrilled to hear the developer was making a sequel that built off the first. \n\nThis game is all about exploring the different realms (dungeons) & extracting cores from all the different monsters you come across to either spawn them as they are for use in your team or breeding. Breeding is awesome because it allows you to get stronger versions of the monster or cross breeding them with other monster types to get something new. All your monsters can be equipped to cast spells & can also carry artifacts that increase stats or give other attributes.\n\nIf you've played the Dungeon Warrior Monsters series & enjoyed that or the Pokemon series then give this a go. It takes things from games that introduced ideas & adds to them.

The sorcerer plays more like a Pokemon Trainer in that you specialize in magic and have a wide variety of attacks instead of just attacking. Although I think there are alot of improvements this game could work on, most importantly it is missing \"mutliplayer battle-mode\" which would make this game worth the isane amount of hours you put into it.

It can get a bit grindy and tedious over the long run, and highly tactical decision making has its place with certain party compositions and against some enemies.

Vos cr\u00e9atures se multiplieront rapidement apres avoir captur\u00e9 des coeurspour les invoquer, puis par la suite l'elevage est de la partie, afin de decouvrir de nouvelles especes ou cr\u00e9er des creatures avec de meilleurs stats.

Ils pourront \u00e9voluer a l'infini avec tout plein de stats sympatique et des combo dements a faire. \n\nLes dieux et leurs royaumes: dans votre chateau vous avez un cristal permettant de vous teleporter dans les autres royaumes, vous pouvez choisir le niveau (influent sur les lvl de mob) mais pas la destination (sauf avec sort alteration). Vous vous retrouvez donc teleport dans un niveau qu'il vous faut explorer au mieux, afin de plaire au Dieu pr\u00e9sent. A chaque fois vous recevrez une quete, et de nombreux evenement aleatoire permettant de monter votre affinit\u00e9 avec le dieu. Les paliers d'affinit\u00e9 avec le dieu permettront l'obtention du sort alteration lui correspondant, ainsi que des sort ou bete rare.

Dragon Warrior Monsters is one of my favorite video games of all time and hearing about a Steam game in the same vein was exciting to me. For sure, this does have a lot of the addicting qualities that you like to see in an RPG of this sort, like the push to continually gain favor with realm gods and build new artifacts for your creatures, along with breeding your creatures to continually be stronger.\n\nUnfortunately, there are some innate issues with the game as well. The magic system is poorly thought out and seems to actively discourage you from using magic a lot of the time, for instance. \n\nAnd though it doesn't really affect the overall gameplay -- the game is supposed to focus solely on the actual monster collection, kingdom building and battling, after all -- but the game aesthetically is garbage. It looks like an RPG Maker game in all the worst ways. Your \"Kingdom\" is all inside one building. It will take you less than one hour of gameplay to notice that there are only a relatively small number of actual monsters in the game, with the bulk of the herd being a torrent of recolors of the main \"types\". Breeding will occasionally make no sense at all, with a life monster as the pedigree having a sorcery-type baby because the secondary parent was sorcery. Wanted a life monster on your team so you could have heals and buffs on your side? Too bad! Now (if you're far enough into the game) you have to waste your time getting into tons of battles so the egg can hatch and you can try to re-breed it into a life-type again.\n\nThere's not much in the way of plot either, which I understand is to let the game speak for itself, but I'd still rather a basic plot than the bare-bones explanation you get at the start of the game.\n\nThe game has a lot of good moments. The randomly generated maps with their mini-quests and unique gods are interesting to visit and the battle system is interesting and provides a few extra bits of strategy with defending and provoking. If you can get past some of the growth problems that appear in the mid-game which make it a lot more frustrating to play, you'll probably enjoy this game. At its core, it is a fun, if flawed, monster RPG, which is right in my wheelhouse. And if aesthetics of games or a lack of plot doesn't bother you at all, you'll probably be able to binge the heck out of it with no issues. For all of its flaws, it's still a pretty darn good time in the early and late game stages.", "timestamp_created": 1488116823, "timestamp_updated": 1488116823, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.579658", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30157641": {"recommendationid": "30157641", "author": {"steamid": "76561198126156231", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1428, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511461097}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Jogo muito bom, quem jogou Dragon Warrior Monsters vai gostar muito!", "timestamp_created": 1487996847, "timestamp_updated": 1487996847, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30050290": {"recommendationid": "30050290", "author": {"steamid": "76561198087350671", "num_games_owned": 90, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 2004, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501962552}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is GREAT.

Team composition strategy is incredibly deep and there are innumerable combinations that \"work\", although you will likely have to change your strategy depending on the opponents you expect to face. Obvious and subtle synergies abound, thanks to the huge variety of options available. I haven't even mentioned spell gems, artifacts, runes, or cards, all of which significantly expand your choices.\n\nFrom Disgaea, Siralim 2 draws the emphasis on \"grinding\" and replayability that underlies the entire game. Siralim 2's gameplay relies largely on a basic cycle: prepare your creatures in your castle (where the NPCs reside), then venture out into procedurally generated dungeons to progress. Of course, this is a vast simplification, since preparation includes any number of activities such as breeding creatures, upgrading artifacts, visiting merchants, and managing your inventory and your creatures' loadouts; and adventuring includes exploration, battles, mini-quests, and boss levels. What little story there is is not the main focus; instead, you upgrade your character (gaining perks that help you both in and out of battle) and your castle (expanding the NPC services available to you). Nearly everything in Siralim 2 has some sort of progression to it, whether it's improving your artifacts' quality by battling through their inner realms (presumably inspired by Disgaea's Item World) or performing mini-quests for the deity of a realm to improve your relationship so you can unlock various bonuses and rewards. (Each deity has a very distinct and entertaining personality.)\n\nHowever, as with any grind-heavy game, it's possible to become exhausted by the repetition. Disgaea had obvious \"training maps\" where you would just level up your characters by performing the same set of actions each time, which very quickly became very boring. Siralim 2 avoids that trap by having procedurally generated levels, but if you are very averse to grinding for progression, you might want to play short sessions and take breaks. In Siralim 2, you mostly have to set your own goals, otherwise progression can feel meaningless; however, it's easy to find goals to aspire to, since the game provides so much to do.\n\nI would also like to commend Siralim 2's transparency of mechanics. It's almost always obvious what something will do, so the player doesn't have to experiment endlessly (or consult a guide) just to figure out basic game mechanics. When something isn't obvious, there is often in-game help to explain it. Many, many games have opaque or hidden mechanics that often cause the player to regret past decisions. (Dark Souls is a particularly notorious example; I would also name Sacred as an offender.)\n\nThere is even more in Siralim 2 that I haven't mentioned at all! Note that I haven't even completed the story and I'm sure there is more waiting for me. On top of all of this, Thylacine is still improving and updating the game often, and has already released an expansion for free.\n\nI could go on and on, but Siralim 2 is worth your time and your money. I think lack of exposure is this game's worst problem. It's certainly niche, but it deserves more players. I highly recommend Siralim 2 to anyone interested in an intricate, complex, innovative game that not only embraces the best parts of its inspirations but expands upon those concepts to become a timeless gem that deserves far more acclaim than it has so far received.", "timestamp_created": 1484719593, "timestamp_updated": 1484719593, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.539384", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29250883": {"recommendationid": "29250883", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999168939", "num_games_owned": 321, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 4782, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493955108}, "language": "english", "review": "Quite enjoyable.

The game is fun and to me the game is all about forming a team of six monsters that have good synergy with each other. So your often rethinking your strategy.

WASD, Enter, and Back.  On a my XBox controller, multiple buttons are auto-mapped for Enter and Back so I find it very nice that, no matter what my prefferred buttons are to use for \"main action\" and \"secondary action\" I have it already mapped and ready to go!  Like to use the A and B buttons?  How about the RT and LT?  It allows it!  Nice touch!\n\nThis game is about strategic nuance and figuring out your preferred synergy.  You create yourself a mage, but you are. Ot a front-line troop, you are more like the CEO.  You select your creatures and then command them to do all the heavy lifting for you.  Every creature is unique, even though some appear to be a simple reskin.\n\nCLASS\nEvery creature belongs to either Life, Death, Sorcery, Nature, or Chaos.  Certain classes are more effective against others, but it does not mean that if you have a party of, say, Death creatures that you will automatically lose against a party of Life enemies.\nFAMILY\nCreatures also belong to a FAMILY, so you will find Griffons, Ghouls, Yetis, Priests, and many many more.  Each FAMILY has a bias towards certain stats, for example Banshees tend to have decent Intelligence, Defense, and Speed but their Attack is lacking.  Within the family you will find 5 to 6 variations which will each have a unique TRAIT and will have a slight variation to their stat bias, some may have a bit more defense, some may be faster, and so on.\nTRAITS\nThe REAL star of this game is the TRAIT system.  Every creature has its own unique trait and they are very varied.  Here are some just as a taste:\nWhenever this creature attacks, the enemy's stats get set to the lowest value.\nThis creature gives a boost to Defense for every creature from its FAMILY in your party.\nWhenever this creature Provokes, your other creatures get an increase to their Attack and Speed.\nThis creature gives Mend to all your other creatures.\nThis creature allows all your other creatures to cast Major Healing for 0 Mana.\nWith Six creatures, you can really have a lot of fun experimenting with different synergies.  I had a party where a creature had a chance to resurrect whenever it hit, another creature that had a chance to resurrect whenever it GOT hit, and another that, whenever a party member dird he got a percentage of their stats as a buff.  I kept the fight going for a very long time, constantly killing and resurrecting my creatures, pumping up my creature to ludicrous levels.  Once I did decide to finally attack he did millions of damage!\n\nAnother fun thing is artifacts.  Your creatures can each equip one artifact.  Generally, artifacts just give stat bonuses, however you can also have artifacts with TRAITS on them, which means that in a group of 6 creatures you have a whopping 12 TRAITS to play around with!  The deliciousness of synergies and figuring things out and experimentation is mouth-watering!\n\nSPELLS\nYour mage, being the CEO, does not cast any spells himself, but has his creatures do it for him.  A Spell is cast by equipping a creature with a Spell Gem and the Spell Gems themselves are also quite varied.  Spell Gems will have different modifiers on them.  Some use health to cast instead of mana, some will cast on hit, when hit, when defending, when killing, when getting killed, at the start of battle, etc.  You can have two of the same Spell Gem with modifiers on it make the spells work completely differently!  This can lead to some confusion because I was at first thinking \"why are my creatures casting a spell???  I did not tell them to!\"  And then I looked through and realized that they were casting their spells based on the modifiers.while there isn't a hugely robust tutorial, the game provides you with all the necessary information in the Library.  Take the time to read!  Mich confusion can be averted with a little patience and bookworming.\n\nTruly, there is a lot more to this game!  There are Gods with various favors they bestow upon you, mysterious [REDACTED] Creatures which allow for even MORE customization, Arena battles, customization of just about everything, and lots of Quality of Life things.  Don't like grinding for materials?  Send a party of creatures out to do it for you!  Looking for a specific creature that you have, but need more of?  Create charms that cause myltiples of that creature to appear so that you can get more!  Slow paced combat making grinding a grind?  Turbo Mode!  Boss battles too slow?  There is a punishment that allows Turbo Mode in boss battles!  Too easy?  Punish yourself...there is even a God of Punishment, he enjoys seeing you suffer!  Too hard?  Rethink strategy, grind some lower floors, breed your creatures to make them mich stronger than what their level implies.\n\nTo say this game has its hooks in me is an understatement.  I love it, I will be spending mich time on it, and the wonder of discovery is still strong as I am learning new things each time I play!\n\nCriticisms: \nNothing is perfect so I will list some of the things that do not serve to add to my enjoyment here:\nRetro-I am kind of sick of NES and SNES graphics, honestly.  Yes I remember growing up with Mario and such, but I am kind of over the charm of 8-bit graphics.  Also, the lack of animation in battles is not pleasing.\nBugs-very few bugs, but I have had a situation twice now where I have grinded out a dungeon and then the evil \"program stopped working\" thing pops up and forces me to close game.  I did not lose a lot of progress and, honestly, some of it could be due to the fact that I am abusing Synergies to have my creatures with Millions in their stat points and casting a spell that casts three times cast itself....so maybe I just overtaxed the game engine.\nGrinding-even with the Quality of Life things, there is still a lot of grinding and repetition of tasks.\nLack of Transparency-in a game so focused on strategic and tactical control, when it comes to actual fights, you cannot view your creature's stats.  So you are getting \"+1.2M Attack\" messages, but, in combat, you cannot inspect your creature to see how much attack they actually have.\nStory-there is bot much of a compelling plot, it is not really the focus of this game, so it is not so much a \"story\" as it is a \"nudge to jeep you moving forward.\"\n\nTo me, these are minor criticisms, not even detracting from my enjoyment enough to give me any pause in recommending this game and looking forward to when I can go, fire up my PC, and continue on my adventure!", "timestamp_created": 1483708080, "timestamp_updated": 1483708080, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498670", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28964055": {"recommendationid": "28964055", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039395140", "num_games_owned": 573, "num_reviews": 55, "playtime_forever": 32, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483398457}, "language": "english", "review": "A while back I posted on this game's forums because it seemed interesting but the screenshots made it look strange to me.  A sort of RPGMaker vibe I guess.  I'm not sure why I didn't buy it sooner, but I always intended to try it.  \n\nI have a few other games in this genre and I know of a few others that try way too hard with the nostalgia goggles.  The games always end up feeling forced and the gimmicks wear out their welcome fast.  I keep tricking myself into buying those games too, only to realize that aside from a few (Castle in the Darkness comes to mind as a stellar example of good retro throwbacks) I'm frustrated by the cognitive dissonance that exists between the games-as-advertised and the finished product.  \n\nI'm not saying all of the \"meh\" games in the retro vein deserve to be ragged on.  Far from it.  Personally, I keep buying them hoping that something will capture my attention.  Chronicles of Teddy and Enter the Gungeon come to mind- wonderful throwbacks that offer something new, but unfortunately with my...  Eccentric gaming tastes feel like they're trying way too freaking hard to smash together concepts, both retro and newer-ish, and most of them (to me) feel like I'm playing \"Zelda Sandwiched Between Fez and FTL\" or some crap like that.\n\nTo cut myself off here, Siralim 2 absolutely deserves way more attention and recognition than I've seen it get.  I haven't played a whole lot yet but this developer really, *really* cares about their product.  So much so, that not only do you notice the labor of love immediately upon starting the game for the first time, but rather quickly it sets in, the obvious affirmation that this is a game made by someone who wanted to make something they themselves wanted to play.  To me, that is always a promise that there are still people out there who don't quit- they don't stop working and refining their game until they are happy with it personally.  So yeah, I really appreciate being able to figure those things out so quickly, especially from games that might fall under the radar because it's practically impossible now in CURRENT YEAR to differentiate the good from the ugly side of non-stop game releases.  I admire Thylacine Studios for being indie, having a vision and not once comparing themselves to anything else.\n\nSiralim is actually quite beautiful.  The variety of loot, monsters, and lore are staggering.  I regret not giving it a chance earlier.  \n\nGraphics:  Retro stuff you'd expect from a game throwing back to the days of 8-bit RPGs.  Tons of variety in the characters and everything fits together seamlessly, and it's very hard not to admire how much attention to detail was paid.  Smooth framerate and nice, big sprites, without the messy and worthless shader effects that so many of these games think they need because we all know that downgrading our displays with scanlines and horrible curvature, bloom and HDR effects makes us feel so warm and fuzzy.  No, Siralim is proud of it's visual style, and I love it.\n\nSound:  I haven't heard enough to comment but you don't really need a lot here to be halfway decent.  So far I haven't heard anything that seems out of place.  Siralim is definitely it's own world, it's own game.\n\nControls:  Playing with a controller worked with no extra effort required by me using DS4Windows on Windows 10 and a wired Dualshock 4 controller.  Pick up and play, no fuss.  \n\nOverall:  I intend to sink as much time into this as soon as I get the chance.  This is one of those games where a lot of people will stand tall and say that the asking price is worth it without any questions.

This game felt familiar in the best way, in terms of the core mechanics. However, team composition and customization are much deeper than I anticipated - also in a good way. Creatures each have unique traits, which really set them apart from each other and can form distinct roles. It's important to be aware of your enemies' traits - you don't want to let one with a stacking defense buff live for more than a few turns, for example. Conversely, if you can set up your team with the same creature in a way that lets it survive for a few rounds, it might become unkillable by your enemies. I had a ton of fun theorycrafting and putting together a healing-based team focused around two synergistic traits - the first causes any healing on this creature to also be applied to your whole team, and the second causes any healing any of your creatures receive to deal damage to an enemy proportional to the amount healed. Every turn, each of my creatures heals the creature with the first trait, in turn healing all 6 of my creatures, putting out an incredible amount of damage while also maintaining full health. It's not unbeatable - there are plenty of enemy traits that get in the way of this working perfectly, and nothing is stopping my creatures from being one-shot by an overlevelled foe, but it's quite powerful and was very satisfying to put into action.\n\nIt's hard to describe exactly how much customization is available to you. The key elements of customization, outside of team composition, are spell gems, equipment, and deity points. \n\nIn this game, spells are not restricted to certain creatures. Rather, you can equip any creature with spell gems that enable the castng of the spell they hold. Each creature belongs to a type, sort of an element (life, nature, chaos, death, and sorcery), and a creature can equip any gems of its type. Life spells tend to involve healing or barriers, chaos spells often inflict debuffs - they all have a solid range of effects, though. Each individual spell gem can have a number of traits, such as reduced mana cost, increased damage, increased buff/debuff duration, and even a chance to cast when the creature is hit or attacks another creature. For creatures that are better off attacking than casting, equipping them with on-hit spells can be very effective.\n\nEquipment looks very complex at first, but it isn't hard to work with. There are different types of equipment that enhance health, attack, defense, speed, intelligence, and any combination of these stats. On top of that, a piece can have up to 10 effects on it at max level (equipment levels up as you fight with it equipped). Effects range from flat stat boosts to starting every battle with a specific buff. You can even get a monster's unique trait on a piece of equipment, allowing for some pretty crazy combinations, though each piece can have only one trait. You can unlock an NPC that will let you enchant equipment with certain effects as you desire, provided you have the materials. \n\nDeity points are given when you level up or reach a new level of favor with one of the 15 gods of the game. You can use them to give you and your creatures a very wide range of permanent boosts. I advise investing in the effect that lets you breed creatures of higher gene strength without a ritual, which will let you get stronger creatures faster and without consuming too many resources. The class you choose at the very beginning of the game determines some of the options you have for spending these points. I played a Life mage, which enabled the particular team I discussed earlier with the Overheal trait, allowing my creatures at full health to still receive healing, even if it won't do anything. Don't stress too much over your choices here,  since you can change your class and respec these points eventually, though not for free.\n\nAnother nice thing I want to mention is how consistent and useful buffs and debuffs are. The majority of debuffs applied via spell have a 100% success rate, regardless of how powerful your enemies are. Got some annoying spellcasters? Cast a silencing spell without fear that it'll fail and you'll have wasted a turn - unless, of course, one of your enemies has the trait that makes its team immune to silencing effects.", "timestamp_created": 1483124712, "timestamp_updated": 1483297078, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514532", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28819132": {"recommendationid": "28819132", "author": {"steamid": "76561198107552353", "num_games_owned": 39, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 434, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483081432}, "language": "english", "review": "This started as a fun little game.

The best way I can describe this game is that it is Dragon Warrior Monsters ON CRACK. Level your monsters forever, breed them for better and different offspring, craft items for them, enchant said items, teach them spells, dive through roguelike dungeons... and that's still not even everything.\n\nYou're also trying to work your way up to gaining favor with all the different gods (who give you abilities and sell you items, and give you points you can use to unlock MORE abilities for you and your creatures), expanding your castle, doing quests, cooking food... I haven't even finished my castle yet and I know there's still things I haven't unlocked yet.\n\nThere's a story on the side too, but the main focus is on the gameplay. Even so, the writing is pretty entertaining, and I've laughed quite a few times at things that have happened in the game (as well as raged over the times the game played a joke on me). \n\nSome people complain that the graphics are \"outdated\" but honestly I think the sprite-based stuff is part of its charm. The monster designs are very nice--they range from your typical weird monsters, to big scary ones, to \"cuter\" ones (or, well... I use the term \"cute\" loosely here, but let's just say I was quite satisfied with monsters like the dragons, unicorns, and ravens). No matter what sort of monster you prefer, you'll probably find something you like here. As far as the rest of the graphics go, I do think the smooth text and textboxes are a little jarring alongside the pixelated style of the rest of the game, but I got used to it. Music is nice too, but one or two of the songs don't loop smoothly--otherwise no complaints there.\n\nThe monster battles themselves are excellent, of course. They're fairly complex--you'll work your way up to fighting 6v6 monster fights, and they're delightfully chaotic. You can't always just power through them--due to all the different monster abilities and spells, you have to think about what you're doing, and it keeps the battles really interesting. Especially the boss fights, which always have a trick to them. If you're smart, you can turn a monster's ability against it--I had a really satisfying moment defeating one particular boss with one spell that took advantage of the boss's own ability, and basically watched it kill itself. It was amazing. \n\nCatching monsters is simple--while fighting, you can have your monsters attempt to extract a core from one of the eneimes. If you do it successfully, you can go to your castle later and summon a monster with that core (and some materials, which you gather a lot of in the levels you explore). As for breeding, it works basically like it does in Dragon Warrior Monsters... that is, you breed two monsters together, and they leave you with an egg (literally leave--they're not coming back). The egg hatches into a critter that's stronger than its parents, always inheriting the stronger stats. There's different breeding combinations you can do to get different monsters, and as you explore the levels in the game you'll find pages to the in-game breeding compendum, which makes the process a heck of a lot easier.\n\nI think I've rambled enough. As I said before, if you like monster-raising games, you'll like this.

I am discussing my opinion with other people? Seriously, they never said what rule I broke.  And for the life of me I couldn't find it anywhere. They also failed to mention the rule I broke. And since they deleted my discussion the proof is gone even if they were in the right. Seems like they get upset when they don't communicate with the fans and they accuse people of harassing when the fans try and communicate with them.  They can't take negative opinions and are very immature when admitting their game has a flaw. Despite how nice they seemed in the comments of my review. After getting to know how they act they are not worth supporting anymore until they realize that perhaps you shouldn't treat people like dirt who supply you with income.\n\nMy siralim review: It's too long to post here. I am very passoniate about Siralim 1 having me exceed the character limit. So just press the full review. I'm just sorry I don't enjoy this game guys. \n\nI'm so sorry Siralim team. I wish I could like this game. But it has way too many gameplay issues.\n\nFirstly, I have to say I was hugely dissapointed when I found out Breeding in this is another word for Fusing in other monster catching games. The reason Fusing works in other monster games is because it's free to summon creatures/Capture/scout creatures. Meaning you will have to grind for Resources in this game. You want to try a combo without using up 2 members of your team? You need to grind for about 20 minutes. And also, no upgrades for resource drops. That makes this a very boring grind. The reason fusing in other games works so well is because it doesn't cost resources to summon creatures. you just Capture and fuse. Making testing and trying things out very fun! But you are limited to how much resources you have. Which makes it a very boring grind.\n\nSecondly, I know a lot of people will say \"Oh but Siralim 1 was a huge grind also!\" Yes but that leads to my next complaint. Royalty points/Diety Points. In Siralim 1 you would constantly be gaining Royalty points. Giving yourself a large feeling of advancement. In Siralim 2 you gain Diety points by appeasing gods. AKA doing quests in their Realm. For each quest in Siralim 1 you gain 1 Royalty point. Siralim 2 you gain 5/10/15 and so on diety points for gaining enough points from one of the gods. And this feels much more of a boring grind than a feeling of advancement.\n\nThirdly, abilities getting nerfed. Now I agree some abilities were a bit crazy. But my main issue with this is that the creatures don't really have much of a different function from others. All the abilities are nothing that is really game changing. It's overall just... boring. Seeing that all abilities are mediocre it doesn't really make me want to play and see more. They all feel the same. \n\nI have more but that is all I can think of at this moment. And It's very dissapointing. Trust me it's doesn't feel good to post this! I want to love this game! So much! I love Siralim 1! It's one of my favorite games of all times! And I'm not one of those people who hate grinding in games. I love Siralim 1, Phantom Brave, The Dark Spire! Tons of rpgs that require a huge amount of grinding! The grinding in this game just seems so boring... As I stated on a discussion if they add a new mode where parents don't dissolve after breeding one of my main issues with this game would be solved!\n\nNow don't worry though... This game does have a lot of really good additions. Which is why it's so sad for me to not like it. All the new creatures are really cool and have pretty good abilities for the most part. When they aren't taking nerfed abilities from older creatures. Creatures equipping spells themselves is a really great function. Although if you want to breed a creature from your team you'll have to reequip them to the new creatures. The new realms are nice. And being liked by the gods could be a great function if they didn't limit it to improving your characters and having to grind for a rare drop to try out a breeding combination.\n\nAnd it's not like I only played for 2 or 3 hours. I've played for 12. And it just doesn't get fun to grind for anything on this game. I'm sorry Siralim team. I wish I could like this game more. And some people may like this game.

You can \"end the game\" with your first 6 creatures. A lot of other similar games forces you to change team composition at certain point of the game, since your tier 1 creatures just arent as effective as tier 2,3 ones. The game also offer a huge variety of creatures that all have ways to make itself work. The possibility is endless.\n\nI never played Siralim 1,so when I picked up 2, some thing seemed missing, informations or glimpse of the awesomeness await. As a new player, I have no idea I need to be level 60 to unlock warlock, I have no idea the stable thats awaiting me. I could have abandoned the game long before I run into those thing. It would be really nice if blood of alter, stables and warlock, etc are revealed much earlier, you can unlock more of it like the forge.\n\nmaybe Im not deep enough into the game, but the mage class seems very dull, Im barely getting any deity point. With the point I do get, it barely makes any difference, there are some 1 rank wonders, but most of the other perks requires more deity points than I can actually grind at a reasonable rate.\n\nAnother thing I find annoying is you can only buy, but not sell spell gems. My latest save only has about 50 hours, but Im already getting like 3 to 4 pages of spell gems of each kind, I didnt even bother to farm for any spell gems, I can only imaging the horror when Im level 600 instead of 60.Can't wait for the free addon ,another 100 of hours of great gameplay.", "timestamp_created": 1473618851, "timestamp_updated": 1479973713, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502797", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25462690": {"recommendationid": "25462690", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075488512", "num_games_owned": 209, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1972, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482776942}, "language": "french", "review": "Savant m\u00e9lange entre un pokemon et un rpg plus classique (du m\u00eame style que final fantasy x pour citer un exemple) . une grande diversit\u00e9 de cr\u00e9ature toutes uniques avec une optimisation tr\u00e8s pouss\u00e9e (\u00e9quipement, enchantement, sort \u00e0 \u00e9quip\u00e9e et autre bonus sont l\u00e9gion) permettant de nombreuse strat\u00e9gies .\nUn contenu colossal qui se r\u00e9v\u00e9le petit \u00e0 petit au fur et \u00e0 mesure de notre progression .\nBref des dizaines voir des centaines d'heures de jeu en perceptive, si le style rpg old school ne vous d\u00e9range pas foncez .\n", "timestamp_created": 1473600877, "timestamp_updated": 1473600877, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25454715": {"recommendationid": "25454715", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062751391", "num_games_owned": 291, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 2612, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503201849}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is like the cooler older brother of pokemon im 22hrs in on the writing of this review and have thourghly enjoyed my time on this game, all the custemizasion will have you completly absorbed into the world (Your kindom) of Sirlam the creatures a really cool and the spells and traits are buffed and tuff there are many classes of creature and class of mage you can choose from in the begining of your Grand journey the amount of content in this game will never stop supriseing you i highly recomend this game on quality of playtime ( which can go for hrs i fully exspect about 50-80hrs on my death mage file alone) the replayabilty is really there so many RPG elements its unreal each creature has an uniqie skill or trait that can be further buffed by equipping a mace,sword,shield,armour, wizard hat etc and those items can be upgraded almost endlessly as it lvls up with your critter and dont forget your spells too each of your monsters can hold 3 spell gems!

Everyone dies in one hit?\nHere take some \"challenge\" modifiers, to dungeon generation.\n\nStill not good?\n\nOk, how abot just one hard fight, with some random monsters, with bunch of buffs and your debufs, that can be summoned from item?\nOh, and they lvl will scale to lvl of your team.\n\nOh, and it can be like this:\n+ 189% damage to you\n- enemy block all phisical / magical damage\n+ 74% speed (enemy ofcouse)\n- your minion's stats are switched in random order (like def -> speed and ets.)\nOh, and their lvl are yours, times 5.\nEnjoy.\n\nTo hard?\nNo problem.

Also, the monsters are better.\n\nSeriously though, I've got some 120 hours in the original Siralim, and the sequel improves on the original in almost every way. If you're not familiar with Siralim, think old-school, 8-bit RPGs like Dragon Warrior and Final Fantasy combined with creature collection and a deep customization/stats system. There are more than 500 creatures to fight or to fight for you once you've obtained them.\n\nThe creatures all have unique abilities and they all stack, so half the fun of assembling a squad of creatures is figuring out the best way they can amplify each other's abiltiies. You can forge weapons, enchant them, and upgrade them -- and you decide the bonuses they'll grant based on what works best for a particular creature.\n\nCompared to the first, this game has a better flow, it's more accessible, and there's an abundance of variety right from the get-go -- whereas in the first game you had to complete rituals to unlock new tiers of creatures, in Siralim 2 the creatures get more exotic and strange the further you go into what the game calls \"realm depths.\" (Kind of like levels, but with some big differences.)\n\nThe familiar creatures are all back, including favorites like the Fallen Carnage, Unicorn Vivifier and Servant Hunter. The new creatures and creature classes look awesome, and add lots of interesting possibilities for building your team.\n\nThere are new realm types, a new pantheon of deities, new types of quests, new upgrades to your castle, a rehauled nether creature system, and even greater customization through runes, gems and the character/creatures/perks point system.\n\nAnd if you're new to Siralim, you'll feel right at home with the way the game presents itself and operates -- everything feels intuitive, as if Siralim is an RPG gem from the NES era. If you played those early Dragon Warrior and Final Fantasy games you'll pick it up in no time.\n\nBasically, Siralim 2 is the best of the NES and SNES-era classic RPGs with the depth we expect from modern RPGs. It's a nostalgic RPG for adults.\n\nA few caveats:\n\n- The game seemed very easy in the early going, and I'm not sure if that's because I played the original and already knew how to start customizing and enhancing right away, or if the difficulty curve was softened. What I can say is that the game got appreciably more difficult by the 15/16/17+ realm depth.\n- As a kid, I could listen to those repetitive 8-bit chip soundtracks for hours-long marathon sessions. As an adult, I have my limits. Even though Siralim 2 has a much wider variety of music, and different tracks for each realm type, the game thankfully allows you to turn the music off while retaining sound effects. Personally, I enjoy listening to podcasts while playing Siralim.\n- Especially in the early game, sometimes it's very difficult to whittle creatures' HP down to extract their cores without killing them. If you run into that problem, unequip your artifacts so you can damage early creatures without killing them outright.\n- Buddy the Cat should have his own throne! Siralim's dev has a cat named Buddy, and so do I, so I'm partial to little Buddies.

To those of us who built the perfect teams.  To those of us who found joy in finding that crazy spell combo the developers never thought of.  To everyone who got all the characters to level 100, just to do it.\n\nAt a surface level, Siralim 2 seems like the same indie dungeon crawler you've played dozens of times before.  A retro sprite aesthetic, 2D procedurally generated dungeons, and several other seasoned gimmicks many of us remember from your childhood are all here.  What makes Siralim special is that Thylacine Studios took no half measures in crafting a very specific experience.  This is a min-maxxers paradise.\n\nThe realms of Siralim 2 are populated with hundreds of monster types to serve as both adversaries and party members.  Each monster has a special ability, and its these often absurdly powerful bonuses that can completely change the way you play the game.  You have things like: heal your whole party for 25% of their HP every turn, lower all your target's stats to be equal to its lowest one on every single creature you attack, give your whole party 30% chance to dodge all attacks, deal damage at the beginning of every enemy's turn, gain huge damage bonuses every time you're attacked, increase your defense by a percentage of your allies', and many many more.  \n\nBoring little \"+1% passive damage\" perks are nowhere to be found here.  There are countless synergies and strategies to exploit, with lots of play and counter-play as a result.  At times, it almost evokes the sense of a collectable card game in how you can cobble together a seemingly invincible combo, only for something else to hard counter it and force you to think on your feet.  There are hundreds of monsters with so much variety, picking just 6 at a time for your party can be torture.  The sheer wealth of meaningful options is hugely liberating in this era of careful moderation in RPGs.\n\nIt has to be said that this is a grinder.  You will spend hours clearing dungeon floors, leveling up, getting gear and perfecting your team for the next challenge.  Thylacine Studios recognized their target audience and didn't put in much that distracts from that core appeal.  You're either going to enjoy that endless dungeon crawling gameplay and the many little mechanics that add depth to that experience, or you'll find the repetition tiring and quit early.\n\nThis one is for all of you who could never put the controller down after the credits rolled.", "timestamp_created": 1471411579, "timestamp_updated": 1471482657, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.635048", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24965505": {"recommendationid": "24965505", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961903103", "num_games_owned": 115, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 6976, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472247841}, "language": "english", "review": "+500 unique monsters.

I had to sleep and work in that time period as well. Literally all my free time has been spent playing the game, because it's that addicting.\n\nThe game slow-rolls you all the increasingly complex systems one at a time, and nothing ever gets old. I haven't encountered anything particularly game-breaking except for a few spelling errors and some awkward controls issues, but it's been overall smooth sailing. I've never felt lost or inundated with information, and the in-game Library is very helpful for the most part, and contains information on pretty much every question I've had so far.\n\nThe graphics are generally good, for being pixel art, and the overall aesthetic is really similar to games like the original Dragon Warrior Monsters. The music isn't awful, but the loops are very short so it does get repetitive pretty quickly (spending more than 2 or 3 minutes on a floor means the music will loop eight times or so). Some floors do have great music, though, so it kind of evens out. Since each floor has its own tileset, interactables, and music, each floor does feel very well put together.\n\nThe gameplay is solid overall but there are some complaints I could make. Breeding monsters is a blast, and \"catching\" them (extracting their cores in battle) is generally not particularly difficult. Leveling up creeps to a grind around level 15-20, but luckily dungeon grinding always feels impactful. You're usually not just farming for EXP, you're farming for Power to complete your rituals, resources to hatch eggs or summon monsters from cores or buy items or modify your artifacts. Or favor with a particular God. Or hunting for Artifacts. Or looking to extract Cores. There is just so much to do on every floor! Completing a single floor might only get you part way on all your aforementioned goals, but since it usually generates progress on all of them  it winds up feeling pretty good. Boss battles have been challenging but staggered at just the right pace for me- during the last boss fight I beat him with 2 of my 6 monsters left alive, both pretty low on health and drained of MP. Earlier ones were a bit easier, but that just makes me believe that the NEXT boss will be even more of a challenge.\n\nThere are lots of systems to get familiar with- understanding artifacts is a big one. The breeding compendium appears to have thousands of entries so there are tons of opportunities to create new, interesting monsters whenever you get tired of your old ones. There's upgrades to your base that unlock new opportunities for you, from sidequests to vendors to re-rolling stats on your equipment. It seems almost endless, but nothing feels out of place.\n\nThis is exactly the type of game I've been dreaming about for years. I've been nostalgic for the original Dragon Warrior Monster games for a long time, and this scratches that same itch tenfold.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is, if you think you'd like this game, you'll probably love it.

Siralim 2 is a grinding monster collection and training game with the story being more of a side project rather than your main focus. The developing team works with you and responds to your forum posts and emails within the day! With a responsive community and staff, any questions you might have can be answered.

You should buy this game. You will enjoy it and get your money's worth. \n\nThis game is almost exactly like the old Dragon Warrior Monster (and now Joker) games, with several improvements. You can find breeding recipes, so you actually know how to breed up to the rare monsters, every monsters has a unique ability that change how you play, and the strategy actually matters the deeper you get in to the game. I got to level 12 of the dungeon without putting any thought in to how my party interacts with their abilities and got rekt.\n\nThe soundtrack is a solid 8/10. I enjoy it a lot, but I find myself tempted to turn it off if a session goes longer than 2 hours. Lots of looping, which you expect from a smaller dev. team.\n\nSome things that took me a second to figure out:\n- Getting to breed takes awhile to unlock. I forget what dungeon level it was now, but be patient and just enjoy collecting cores in the mean time.\n- To hatch an egg, you have to place it on the hay in the hatchery. (I missed that in the text I guess, and it took me 5 minutes to figure out :/)\n\nEhhh I guess that's it.\n\nOverall I give this game a 9.5/10. I get that the point isn't to have an amazing plot.

In Siralim 1, the majority of your minmaxing time was just spent on figuring out your party of monsters and their layout.  Figuring out complimentary abilities, how to use them, and so on.

It has endless creature and realm levels, allowing for potentially infinite play. And contrary to many other procedurally generated games, it's not just infinity for infinity's sake. It's got a staggering amount of content and variety. In fact, the game's still introducing crucial new gameplay elements after dozens of hours playtime.\n\nCompared to the first game, Siralim 2 is a little more reserved in it's approach to levels and scaling. Enemies no longer scale to the player's level, allowing you to farm past realm 30 and beyond even with a suboptimal team. The introduction of gods gives the player more stuff to do and is overall a good move.\nThe nether creatures take something of a back seat compared to the new breeding system, which is the main way for improving your party aside from levelling. It's also the way through which new monsters are introduced in the wild, which is neat.\n\nAll that said, the game is still a little rough around the edges. Strange things occur when you clash together such a staggering amount of variables. Some of these strange things might be intentional (monsters casting spells while silenced via special abilities), others probably aren't (When spell gems should be shared with allies, they're sometimes also shared with the enemy?) and most of it can work in favor of both sides.\nAlso, the palette swaps are probably unavoidable due to budget concerns I'm still gonna point them out. And the combat can get a little boring eventually, to the point where it eventually becomes the game's weakest feature. An auto resolve option might be problematic to implement, but might also help speed along the game's flow later on.\n\nVerdict: A highly complex game, recommended for anyone who's ever enjoyed a Pokemon or Final Fantasy game.

(i.e.) siren oracle in siralim gave a barrier at the start of the battle equal to 25% monster health for each monster. this barrier would absorb all physical and magical damage until it is exausted however negative status like poison and bleed still cause damage to the monsters health. new siren oracle doesn't do this but the life mage has a set of abilities that replace this well and potentialy surpass it. One after being fully upgraded gives the full barrier effect and another lets you create the barrier continuously. when conbined with leach and new things called runes and their effects it becomes almost imposible for your monsters to loose all their health.\n\nI can't say i love everything but i like the artifact creation for sure. enchanting an artifact with a trait creates a trait you can now equip to any creature along with the other stat bounuses it has on the artifact. think about it equipable traits with stat bounuses which is even better when the traits give stat bounuses.

I also feel like starting over again with one of the 5 elements I have yet to play!\n\nThis could be true: \n\nMany years ago a group of game designers were born on a mountain top somewhere in Tibet.  There were created with one goal in mind for their lives, to create the most nearly perfect game in existence.  While the computer had not yet been invented (small calculators had not yet made way to Tibet at this time), they met daily, and discussed how they might accomplish this goal.  Finally, once computers were invented they created the ultimate game, that ticked off almost every box you can imagine (crafting, catching critters, breeding critters, character building etc...)\n\nThe result was Siralim 2.  While you might foolishly think they forgot to include something in this game, you soon realize how silly you are, and that you had not gotten far enough into the game to unlock the missing component to this game. \n\nI have spent the last 30 gaming years hiding in my own cave (man) in pursuit of such a game.  While the graphics look like something from the 90's just remember, these guys were stuck in Tibet.  The music is not terrible, and sometimes I leave it on, rather than put on my own music.  \n\nBuy this game, you won't regret it.  Don't put it on your wishlist and wait for it to go on sale.  Pay full price!  This will greatly increase the odds of a Siralim 3, complete with modern graphics.  Oh, I had one tiny problem.  The 2nd boss stole my lunch money over and over again on one of my runs.  Made 2 other characters that beat it to a pulp almost instantly.

Such a great update to the first one that it is both a great starting point for new players and worth the small price for Siralim veterans.\n\nPeople who love discovery, experimentation, and strategy will be pulled in by all the different gameplay systems Siralim's creators have meshed together. You have a team of six creatures with a variety of combat stats--but it's much deeper than that. Your creature taming character, for one, is one of 5 classes with game-changing abilities. Each creature has spells, which don't necessarily need Mana to cast--some leech off the user's HP or have a % chance to be cast randomly. Each creature has a very unique trait, ranging from Area of Effect attacks to buffing your team's Defense to spitting out a poison cloud when it is attacked. Each creature carries an artifact to specialise its stats and potentially give it an additional trait extracted from other monsters. Siralim 2 is a beautiful and crazy madhouse of potential synergies that just take some critical thinking to achieve. And when you achieve that perfect team--that team that gives the enemy 0 time to react, that team that has a gamebreaking amount of defense, that team that Power Rangers fuses together into one great hound and mauls the enemy--that's what you've worked for for all those hours. But there's always a next step, always something more to perfect.\n\nI do believe that this game has a somewhat niche audience--this is not for people turned off by turn-based combat or repetitive gameplay--but I believe that you wouldn't have even scrolled down this far if that's the case. One thing which might not be too obvious from the previews is the sandboxy nature of the game, which is to say that you make your own goals most of the time. The story will carry you for a while (~20 hours in my case but it could easily be done in less than 10), and afterwards you'll find a multitude of things that can grab your attention. Want to reach floor 100? go for it. Want to collect one of each creature? go for it. Want to start a winning streak at the arena? Finish building all castle expansions? Collect super rare creatures?

S2, on the other hand, feels big, fresh,thrilling and satisfying from the word go. Here are some of the highlights, with comparisons between the two generations:\n\nCUSTOMIZATION: Damn, Thylacine! So artifacts, spells, passive abilities, rituals, nether orbs and hundreds of different creatures weren't enough? Now, we have God's Favour, Runes, Cards, Multiple Spell Slots, Gems, Meals and who knows what else on the horizon?? That is the sound of an itch being scratched.\n\nThe incredible freedom afforded by S2 is palpable. There is a genuine sense as you play that you can try any team comp, any strategy, and you will find a way to make it effective. The game practically screams at you to experiment, and allows a level of creativity that S1 often grazed, but never fully penetrated.\n\nSPELLS: S1's spell system was, in my opinion, dreadful. 99% of the time, spending an entire turn draining your mana into a single spell with a very meh effect essentially removed it as a viable tactical option, given that by the time you had any decent spells, you had invested in your team's abilities so much that you would be mad not to use your turn sending them in to Provoke/Attack. Casting spells felt boring and pointless.\n\nBut S2, oh you beauty, you learned well. Now your creatures cast the spells, and by God, do they do it like it ain't no thang. Spells are now gems, equipped onto slots on each creature (which average 3 slots each, meaning you normally have access to no less than 18 different effects in a given round of combat) and these gems can have random situational triggers (such as taking damage). This makes every single round of combat in S2 unique, exciting and meaningful, as a chaotic chain reaction of damage, debuffs and spell triggers can turn the tide of battle at any point!\n\nREALMS: How many were in S1, like seven? S2 says HAVE ALL TEH RAELMS. And Gods, because why not?\n\nTHE ONE THING I DON'T LIKE: Those \"boss\" battles. Very gimmicky. Often frustrating if your team comp is not designed to deal with a particular enemy/effect. Can bottleneck your experience somewhat. Pro tip - INSPECT is your friend.\n\nOVERALL: The game feels much more sandboxy and creative than S1. The battles are geuinely exciting. Things are looking good S2!

If you care about HD headshots, go elsewhere.\n\nThis game and its predecessor are everything games like Dragon Quest Monsters and Pokemon bring to the table, except with all the complexity and depth being an intentional work of craftsmanship on the part of its (I believe) singular developer, rather than a series of company wide half-flavor, half-We-Have-No-Idea-What-Makes-A-Monster-In-Our-Own-Game-Viable-And-Fun-But-Not-Broken compromises. Which is not to say that every little aspect of the game is perfect (though for an early access game, much of it is functional and very fun), and it isn't to say that every monster is useful (some seem to be tailor made for ridiculously specific situations that are harder and harder to forcibly create the more punishing the game gets, and though I haven't hit that point yet, I can already see it on the horizon), and it isn't even to say that the game systems are so balanced that they cannot be broken (breaking them is part of the fun, you're going to need to to get past the deeper realms). But what there is a kind of ballet to the many, many interlocking game systems as devised by the developer, with an elegance and a real love for the genre. There is so much satisfaction to be had in discovering new monsters, puzzling out new strategies, unlocking new features, and feeling like the game is ready to meet and challenge you on a level that those other games, bless their child friendly hearts, are not.\n\nAs a series of final notes, I'll say that in my review for the first game I asked for boss fights and more of a story, and indeed this game delivered these, with me clocking the story's completion at 24 hours (not bad at all for the state of modern RPGs). I'll say this game delivered things I didn't ask for, such as a completely overhauled spell system and a better system for unlocking new monsters, which have brought as much pleasure to me as the angry totem god who called me ugly (more than you think). I'll say this game boasts all I have talked of whilst not even completed and more to come.\n\nSo nerds, buy the game.", "timestamp_created": 1467106801, "timestamp_updated": 1467106801, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.559946", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23800122": {"recommendationid": "23800122", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019743733", "num_games_owned": 669, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1424, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483477212}, "language": "english", "review": "Successfully evokes Dragon Warrior nostalgia while possessing a great deal of mechanical depth, with a great variety of customization options that open up fairly quickly.", "timestamp_created": 1466878536, "timestamp_updated": 1466878536, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.999545", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23703079": {"recommendationid": "23703079", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005489951", "num_games_owned": 76, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 11231, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499710093}, "language": "english", "review": "gr8 game", "timestamp_created": 1466591699, "timestamp_updated": 1466591699, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.471464", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23656693": {"recommendationid": "23656693", "author": {"steamid": "76561197986063677", "num_games_owned": 283, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 3415, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493179081}, "language": "english", "review": "An improvement in every way to the original pretty much, it's a 6 on 6 dragon-quest-monsters-esque game where each creature has a passive ability and the ability to equip an artifact with one other passive and several spell gems, which allow him to do things other than attacking.\n\nLot of fun trying to figure out the most overpowered combinations.

I picked nature which so far seems to mean I have a cyclops who hits hard and regenerates a decent amount of  HP every turn.  I also pick up a weaker combat pet that casts a random spell each time it attacks or is attacked.  I'm not sure if everyone gets that pet.  That would maybe be more interesting if I hadn't played Hearthstone which has lots of random spell effects.\n\nThe pets have relatively few traits and I can give any spells and equipment to any of them, so not much separates them.\n\nI explore randomly generated 'dungeons' which have settings of desert, jungle, and so on.  The setting makes no gameplay difference.  You go around this basic map collecting loot and fighting monsters.  There's some 'mini-quests' which so far are just fetch quests (pick wood up off the map, bring it to a trader's hut for loot, click on mini-totems for angry totem dude).\n\nCombat is a simple affair.  I can get by just attacking each round and it'll be over after 2-5 rounds.  I have spells I could use that buff/debuff for 5-10 turns, I'm not sure how long until using any of these will be worth it when combat ends so quick.  Lots of the spells require 20-50% of your pet's health to cast which makes them even more inefficient, since each pet does have a mana pool they could use instead.  I assume some could become worthwhile later in the game.  For now I only actively use 1 of my 6 spells (debuffs the targets defense), and one automatically gives an attack buff sometimes when my pet is hit.\n\nI completely explore the first 2 dungeons and at the third dungeon I fight a mini-boss that absolutely devastates my 2 pet party.  I guess this means I'm supposed to repeat the level 2 dungeon to gain levels for awhile.\n\n The game says you need strategy and care to beat these bosses, I imagine this means picking a few spells and equipment that might be a bit better suited for those enemies (although I have not encountered specialized spells/equip yet).  Or you could probably just have a standard gear set up, and use grinding as a solution for most of your woes.\n\nThere is a crafting system for components like in Diablo or Grim Dawn, combine basic elements to get something with a beneficial effect.  You also get 'recipes' for evolving your pets, whenever you end up getting those multiple pets to combine into one.\n\nOverall my game time is spent grinding combat and I assume like Diablo and other dungeon crawlers, I'll occasionally consolidate my loot to enhance my powers somewhat.\n\nOverall this is not enough for me.  For a completely pet centric game, I would've lliked to see something more interesting than a 6 party dungeon crawler.  I think of the opening sequence of FF6, which had you using over a dozen moogles to defend a location, or Ogre Battle which does it on a much grander scale, with many parties of 3-6 underlings.   \n\nAlso i thought I read that this was a rogue-like, when I die my pets just get sent back to base so not sure where rogue-like comes in.  \n\nOverall this is an okay game.  It might scratch an itch you have, and depending on what RPGs you've played in the past the experience could be novel and interesting to you.  For someone like myself, who for better or worse has played well over a hundreds of games in the RPG genre over my life, it is not worth 15$ to me for sure, maybe 2-5$.  I've played more ambitious RPGs for free that someone made in RPG maker.\n\nTry it for yourself, and/or support a dev that is making a solid effort.

I like the game a lot, and as such I have a few suggestions for the devs, from a longtime fan of RPG's and roguelikes.\n\n1) I spent a good chunk of my wet-feet character thinking that the back row was significant.  As far as I can tell, it isn't.  I understand you have to get all the sprites on the screen, but maybe scale back the size some to do a single row, or introduce a guard rating for the monsters in the back if nothing else.  Perhaps allow the PC this option to row their monsters as well.\n\n2) Overhaul the battle interface a little, maybe look at doing a list with HP and MP like FF or something, it's more pleasing to the eye than the bottom row of tiles.  Even if the monsters just flash when they attack and bump forward for a second, it's something I'd encourage you to consider.  \n\n3) The map.  I am in love with exploring the different realms, they're fun to uncover, and the style of it really brings me back.  This part of it is nearly flawless, but the map needs some attention, I believe.  Maybe it's meant to be vague to encourage more thorough exploration, but it's nigh unreadable at times.  Maybe a color difference between discovered and undiscovered terrain is what's needed, at the least.\n\n4) Some sort of levelled list of creatures in your stable/in your party.  As it stands I have to check out the character sheet of each creature to determine levels, which evidently are a huge consideration in the game, since you want to construct parties for particular depths/levels.  I also feel like the artifact/equip mechanic needs some love too.  I don't want to have to check out each monster's artifact individually, nor do I want to do the same with spell gems.  It's still in EA so I understand that mechanics are refined further, just suggestions from a fast fan!\n\nAll that having been said, I'm having a good time with the game.

You breed creatures and make them stronger, but it's about more than just raw brute force.

Finding the synergies between these is a lot of fun! It's possible to run theme parties as well. Creatures like Hounds, Hordes, and Griffons have bonuses that depend on creatures of the same type.\n\nThe developer's quite active as well. The game's already feature-complete, so you're not paying for an alpha! In the 2+ weeks I've had the game, I think there have been 3 major patches updating the UI and balance concerns. A lot of these have come from player feedback as well. \n\nDon't let the early access tab scare you away.

Much has been improved since the prior game, especially the spell system as each creature can now equip gems to cast spells based on their element type. This makes party configuration and customization miles better than the previous entry. Additionally, the reputation based systems add a compelling reason to revisit the different realm types, of which there are quite a ton. That, coupled with the new breeding system grants almost endless playability, as you can increase the \"gene strength\" of offspring giving them greater possible stats with each new generation. There are also many combinations that cause new \"evolved\" type creatures to be formed which combine two creature types.\n\nIn terms of criticism that could be leveraged against the game, I would say that the art and map generation are a bit lacking. The game reuses most (maybe all) the creature graphics from Siralim, but there are new ones included as well. This, I don't mind so much as it only means more content. However, I would have liked to see a change of tileset for Siralim, as the layout is more dynamic this time which is great, but the textures/feel of the city are the same as the previous game.\n\nThe game (as of now) is still only at version 0.1 in early access so much may change, but for those who haven't played the first game I would recommend to pick this game up as the content included already surpasses the first game and overall I find it way more fun to play than the first game.", "timestamp_created": 1465178807, "timestamp_updated": 1465178807, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504008", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23410936": {"recommendationid": "23410936", "author": {"steamid": "76561197980795527", "num_games_owned": 255, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 3720, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501101878}, "language": "english", "review": "Did anyone else play with Monsters In My Pocket when they were a kid?

(staffs seem to increase attack and intelligence, whereas axes seem to increase attack and speed) there are also gloves, shields, and other armors that boost your defense and other resistances and there are even ribbons and necklaces and other accessories that boost intelligence or speed and other stats like that. all of the artifacts will endlessly (i think it's endless-i have some at level 1 and some as high as level 9) level up while equipped to a monster. as your rack up kills, you level up the artifacts. \nthis game is something i can see myself playing forever. an endless amount on endlessness. i wish i could more than recommend it.", "timestamp_created": 1465078862, "timestamp_updated": 1465078862, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.475046", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23381586": {"recommendationid": "23381586", "author": {"steamid": "76561197974986915", "num_games_owned": 258, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 17393, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468236054}, "language": "english", "review": "It's amazing.

Daily updates. A dev who chats with the players during early access. Great music. And all the monster collecting you could want. Now lest talk about gameplay. On its surface this is a basic monster collecting and breeding game. You start off selecting your favorite critter from five choices. Each one is specialized in it own way, be it offense, defense, spellcasting, debuffing, or support. You will find all kinds of playstyles to choose from. Then you are sent off on your first quest; to kill some powerful monster summoned by a BBEG. Well along the way you will find more critters than you can shake a stick at and you will eventally fill your party with them. You can have up to 6 in your party at once and like I said before, each has its own thing that its good at, which can be further customized by equipping spells and artifacts. You want a tank that taunts enemies and every time he gets hit he places a DoT on the entire enemy team? go for it. Want a ninja that can dodge lightning and summons meteors every time he swings his sword? yep, you can do that too. Ok, ok, what about a dragon that resurrects allies whenever a spell is cast? you know it. \n\nUnlike other capture and breeding games in the genre, this time you can only evolve critters by breeding. You will come across breeding recipes along your journey. The downside is every time you breed or aquire a new type of monster, that creature can also show up in random battles. So while filling out your codex, the enemy list gets larger. At first you only fight about 8 types, but this list will quickly grow. There will be some where your party composition take easily and some not so much.\n\nTL;DR this is a mildly interesting game in early access. devs are receptive to their userbase. and the game should be checked out if you like the genre.", "timestamp_created": 1464740324, "timestamp_updated": 1464740324, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23315371": {"recommendationid": "23315371", "author": {"steamid": "76561197981561221", "num_games_owned": 340, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 5390, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508829534}, "language": "english", "review": "Like dragon quest monsters/pokemon/monster rancher all rolled up into one, with a castle upgrade system similar to Disgaea.\n\nIf you enjoy monster catching/battling games then Siralim 2 has plenty to offer.\n\n*It's quite addicting!", "timestamp_created": 1464726012, "timestamp_updated": 1464726012, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515306", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23313273": {"recommendationid": "23313273", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024799069", "num_games_owned": 540, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 357, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1465172754}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the most commited and dedicated dev teams I've ever seen for any game.", "timestamp_created": 1464718879, "timestamp_updated": 1464718879, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.529397", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23311318": {"recommendationid": "23311318", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037864828", "num_games_owned": 508, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 3155, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493885005}, "language": "english", "review": "Everything that went \"wrong\" (can I say wrong when Siralim 1 was so addicting?) is now near perfect.\n\nA really addicting Capture-em-all-Game but in a more adult world.

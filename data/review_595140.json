I don't recommend it unless heavily discounted. It wasn't completely boring, but it felt like a game with content for 2 hours stretched to 8 hours, and since I got the achievement \"Insane\", which you get for beating the game with 20 deaths or less, and only 1.7 % of the Steam community have that achievement, that actually means for most people it will take longer than 8 hours and be even more tedious than it was for me. The progression system isn't motivating at all. Enemies get more health and damage, you get more health and damage, that's it. The weapon pool is extremely small and weak.\n\nSo far I'm not liking it. The permanent upgrades you can buy after each run are extremely boring things like \"+1 attack\", \"+1 defense\". You can unlock new loadouts too, but the balance of the loadouts is so bad, some are clearly better than others by far. I also dislike how you start with a full weapon arsenal. I would like to start with one or two weak weapons and then very quickly and often keep finding new and better weapons. Currently you just stick with your loadout most of the time, very rarely find a new weapon.\n\nThe scrolls are also not good. Some have cool effects, some are completely pointless, some can completely kill your run by themselves, and they are completely random. Level design is pointless. There is no reason to arrange the level like a maze, because I have no information to make a decision which door to choose, so I have to choose a door randomly every time. It's purely random which room I find, because you of that the rooms could be linear and it wouldn't make a difference, except that I don't have to keep backtracking.\n\nRuns don't feel different at all. For each pyramid you will encounter the exact same enemies and rooms every time. Rooms started to repeat themselves after one run. Instead of seperate pyramids they should have only one pyramid that changes with progression and over time, adding new enemies and weapons and bosses. Why can't any rogue-lite do it right like Binding of Isaac? The developer abuse rogue-lite here to stretch the play time of the game with no benefit.\n\nAlso, who the hell though playing a Redneck is a good thing? Who wants to be a generic random redneck? That is the worst part of the game. Of course I knew this before I bought the game, which is why I waited for a sale (I bought it for the shooting), but I really don't understand at all why we play a redneck. It doesn't add anything to the game at all. I would rather play one of the egyptian gods you can choose as a \"spirit\".\n\nSome weapons are alright, a few are cool, some are really boring or pointless. The sniper rifle has no crosshair, but you can't zoom neither, and it does less damage than the kunai, and you dont need to reload the kunai. Just wanted to give an example of completely non-sensical weapon balance.", "timestamp_created": 1514053687, "timestamp_updated": 1514240065, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.586260", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37780894": {"recommendationid": "37780894", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088652959", "num_games_owned": 1665, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 733, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 16, "last_played": 1513693869}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u975e\u5e38\u597d\u73a9\uff01\u975e\u5e38\u723d\uff01\u5899\u88c2\u63a8\u8350\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1511789555, "timestamp_updated": 1511789555, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38137657": {"recommendationid": "38137657", "author": {"steamid": "76561198271662359", "num_games_owned": 377, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1615, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 838, "last_played": 1514234053}, "language": "english", "review": "I have played for a few hours and it is quite enjoyable.

similar experience to games like Serious Sam, or Shadow Warrior, \"fast paced\" first person shooter experiences, that have a ton of enemies to take on, etc, etc...\n\nNow the problem with that preconception its that \"Immortal Redneck\" its much more a \"rogue-lite\" type of game, than a shooter in itself.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I love the combat system of this games, and I enjoy most of the weapons \"feel\", but the problem is, most of this aspects serve as a conductor to the actual core gameplay mechanics that are much more related to what you've come to expect from other rogue-lite games.\n\nYou get a similar upgrade system to the one you might have seen in Rogue Legacy, another rogue-lite experience, pretty much you obtain coins, that build up to a hefty amount of cash that then you can spend in upgrades, that are often presented in quite a bland way, minor increases in your damage, health, and defence, stuff like that.\n\nReally the only interesting upgrades are ones that unlock either new skills that in this case allow you to get certain bonuses in your abilities, as well as they serve to vary your starting \"loadout\" which is usually conformed of a couple of weapons.\n\nNow I personally really dislike this system because I feel, similarlly to Rogue Legacy, it brings the game to a halt, and turns it into a chore, in which you constantly find yourself progressing through the game, but up to a point where you literally find yourself facing against a boss battle that can kill you in a single hit.\n\nThis is because as you keep progressing through the pyramids, in which the game takes place in, the enemies get bonuses in their health, as in their damage, as well as you getting bonuses in how much money you earn.\n\nIt is a problem because usually, no matter how familiarized you get with the enemy patterns, you'll eventually hit a blockade that won't allow you to continue, unless you upgrade your character.\n\nAnother one of the issues that I could say I found annoying in the game its the fact that the enemies take too many hits to kill, often times even sustaining the \"flak damage\" produced by the explosion of a rocket shot at mere centimeters away from them.\n\nAnd it is a shame that this game carries this issues because I find the rest of the game to be quite enjoyable.\n\nFor starters I thoroughly enjoy the themes of this game, the whole idea of having a first person shooter with a foul mouthed \"redneck\" who's also a mummy as a plus, its fantastic to me.\n\nPaired that up with the whole idea of playing inside egyptian pyramids, whilst fighting against enemies that are themed around egyptian culture, religion, and history, and well...\n\nAdmitedly there are other enemies that are just small blue dinosaurs that shoot green flames at you, so there's also that I guess.\n\nI also like the combat system, because despite the gunplay feeling rather tedious, and \"rough\" at times, each weapon that you get has a different feeling and function.\n\nIn my last \"playthrough\" I managed to get a rocket launcher, then an assault rifle, so pretty \"standard\" so far for the first person shooter genre, but then I got a \"double barreled\" pistol, with incredible accuracy, and a crowsbow that fired like an automatic assault rifle.\n\nThen I got plenty of upgrades, but none of them really significant, another problem that I find with the game.\n\nThe enemies at times can also be quite repetitive, I guess it's understandable being a rogue-lite, but I wish the game could've at the very least changed how they looked.\n\nOverall tho, I found it to be a rather enjoyable experience, at the very least so far, after 87 minutes of playing I didn't really found the game to be all that hard, its \"mechanical gaming understanding 101\".\n\nYou become aware of what keeps killing you, you try to understand why are you dying so frequently, and then you tackle it.\n\nFor me it was getting flanked by the enemies, so what I started doing was that I started \"hugging\" the walls of each room of enemies, while also playing close attention that nobody would sneak up behind me.\n\nWorked like a charm and end up getting to the last boss of the first pyramid...\n\nSadly the bastard killed me in one hit because of the game's terrible upgrade system, and implementation of it.\n", "timestamp_created":

Pero a diferencia de los aspectos jugables, t\u00e9cnicos o detalles meramente superficiales que posee este juego, voy a exponer una raz\u00f3n muy personal para sentir que este juego es, justo ahora, justo lo que necesitaba.\n\nRecientemente he padecido una ruptura amorosa. \u00bfY sab\u00e9is? En este juego veo un enorme parecido a lo que viene despu\u00e9s. S\u00ed, suena absurdo, pero si entend\u00e9is lo que voy a explicar, creo que lo ver\u00e9is.\n\nHas muerto. Una p\u00e9rdida. Pero no una p\u00e9rdida definitiva, has perdido algo que defin\u00eda tu vida. Y no sabes muy bien por qu\u00e9, est\u00e1s vivo de nuevo, forzado a luchar para volver a la vida.

Est\u00e1s solo contra todo, y tienes escasas posibilidades de recuperar lo que eras en un primer intento. Morir\u00e1s. Muchas veces. Pero cada vez que mueras, volver\u00e1s m\u00e1s fuerte.

Pero no conforme con eso, te quedar\u00e1s dos m\u00e1s.\n\nCada victoria que tienes es relativa. Incluso cada derrota, morir te fortalece y te hace m\u00e1s apto para avanzar m\u00e1s lejos. Hasta que llega el d\u00eda que has logrado hacerte tan fuerte y conoces tan bien tus capacidades que consigues sobreponerte a tu situaci\u00f3n y triunfar.\n\nS\u00e9 que suena raro y que no es normal captar as\u00ed un juego, pero dada mi situaci\u00f3n personal, no he podido evitar ver un parecido m\u00e1s que razonable.\n\nEs justo el juego que necesitaba ahora.

It gets rid of the stupid multi ammo system and trades level ups for purely found upgrades.\n\nWhile it feels and plays really nice, the gameplay loop is just lacking.  It doesn't have any major progressive unlock system of Rogue Legacy, or equipment selection.  You get something similar in a single-selectable-glyph, but in the early parts of the game they're minor to inconsequential.\n\nThe different \"classes\" via gods commonly feel more like punishments than fun alternative options, as many of their abilities are inconsequential to detriment, with starting weapons and stat alterations that don't offset this.\n\nThe bosses are also largely pains to fight, as it shifts rapidly away from fun gameplay to dealing with waiting through loops until you get to damage cycles and ammo shortage.\n\nI really think that the game would drastically benefit from having Tower of Gun's linear level layout, as exploring is as annoying an assinine as it is in  Ziggurat, making playing either a choice of being the same thign every time or exploring for upgrades and loot and having to deal with tons of meaningless backtracking.  There's never anything to gain by going back to any room that you were in previously.\n\nThis game isn't a hard not-recommended, but I think a lot of people are going to find that continued play will become more of a chore than a sense of play and progress, more just doing floors for the \"privelege\" of attempting a boss and that experiencing just being one of time consumption than involved

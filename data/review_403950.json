Massive rituals everyone plays different the magic and world explorng is so good. The combat you dont control on  the battle map but yo watch it happen and have some direction before but its awsome. The way the planes interact very interesting 5 planes from abyss hades to elementals planes n such. Your units are all individuals like they can lose their eye/arms ect such in battles and permannelty lose it very cool unless he was cyclopean to begin with ;(   Theres depth here  one of these iterations if it keeps going WILL be a Eu4 or total war type success im sure. If you like it try Domonions 5 which is very simliar in ways. So this is a real gem thats going places I believe. Get this on sale if you can its a little high if you didnt love dominions 5 might be a risk at full price. If you like age of wonders or eu4 civ, you might like this game if you like those games and DnD or forgotten realms  then this is a must buy because it has so much potential I love games like this but they usually dont get there.  This one is epic in scope yet pays attention to the details in interesting ways. I like this much more the civ-anything and more then age of wonders. Its like forgotten realsm world where one person/player or ai can start rituals that can open hades which leads to crazy destruction or even the abyss  whych is even scarier.  If u summon a demon lord his citadel will be vacant in hell so all sorts of neat stuff like that really cool you can become a lich or vampire theres alot going on. If  you main hero dies  he can be dead forever tho i think the souls goto hades so u could see some again. I found the imperial capital for the first time and some undead master necromancer had wiped out the outter slums and created an abomination that was eating all the bodies and growing huge with a massive army the emperor was huddling in the capotol hill within the city while abbyssal monsters were roaming outside the city. I was like what the hell happened here jeez. That same capitol is in hell and abyss i belive  hell for sure but in that plane the emperor isnt there prolly sum demon lord ect super cool so u can take it over becom a god ;) fun stuuf checkher out!", "timestamp_created": 1514129720, "timestamp_updated": 1514129720, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38243491": {"recommendationid": "38243491", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004310903", "num_games_owned": 135, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1798, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 412, "last_played": 1514311053}, "language": "english", "review": "Had some fun with this but as with Dom 4 never learned it properly.

Not enough better that I put hundreds more hours into it, but certainly worth more than I paid.  This is for someone who likes the 'me against the unstructured world' feel.  So deliciously random, so completly different styles between the species options, so familiar of sprites (I mean, I feel like a third of them look exactly the same as the precursor game they made in the 90's).  Pretty graphics are great for immersion, and this game isn't really about that.  You won't feel like you're really there.  You'll feel like you're building the power of a badass in a world where other badasses are doing the same thing each in their own weird way.  They have added some nice effects, so the spells are a little more identifiable when used.  Note that you still don't actually control the units for the fight.  Your tactical might is in building the best army - not controlling them in the fight.  You have to let go of that need to manage their eveery attack...  On the upside you get to have a fight with hundreds of units and not have to click a thousand times.   \nSaving on turn one is recommended, since you can hose yourself pretty quickly on the first couple of turns.  If you want to lower the stress a little, save often.\nThese guys make Dominion as well, which is more of a 'conquer the map as countries' style using a stunningly similar rules / characters set.  It's fun stuff if you are looking for a more map structure and less exploring.\nFYI - I'm pretty sure the 5th CoE is already out.  The versions are more like major updates, as developers have bills too.  From 3 to 4 wasn't an earth shattering update that changed the genre of the game (f'ing Fallout 4...), but instead a feature upgrade on an already highly replayable game that improves the gameplay instead of replacing it.  I'm thrilled about that, and will keep buying the new versions to promote this style of advancement (well, and because I'll be playing them for hours on end).", "timestamp_created": 1512842174, "timestamp_updated": 1512842174, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38066606": {"recommendationid": "38066606", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999903864", "num_games_owned": 166, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 17169, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 549, "last_played": 1513375727}, "language": "english", "review": "Dwarves are either descended from ants or fungi.", "timestamp_created": 1512426452, "timestamp_updated": 1512426452, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37978289": {"recommendationid": "37978289", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994296450", "num_games_owned": 72, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 10843, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1231, "last_played": 1514132889}, "language": "english", "review": "g", "timestamp_created": 1512140274, "timestamp_updated": 1512140274, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37479897": {"recommendationid": "37479897", "author": {"steamid": "76561198323013753", "num_games_owned": 22, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 7248, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509848311}, "language": "english", "review": "If u like realistic randomness, hard and unrelentin' games, with ease to play with one hand, but deepness to need all your brain and a wise kwnolegde of what-the-heck-does-any-shit that's your game.

The last 4 games I played have had constant demon portals and floating cubes events that create gateways from which massive waves of powerful creatures spawn constantly. It is impossible to respond to these events before they spiral out of control.\nThe only strategy is to hide in your citadel and hope for all of the other factions to be destroyed before you. Or to raise a massive army and try to shut down the portal. And if you destroy the portal then 20 turns later a new one pops up and you can do it all over again.\nI understand that there is an unforgiving RNG element to the Elysium games, but this seems poorly balanced. The portals are way too frequent. It makes gameplay exhausting rather than challenging. \nIt is disappointing that the game balance is crippled by these constant random events. CoE3 had terrifying events as well, but they occurred every 2 or 3 games. \nConquest of Elysium 4 is an amazing imaginative exercise, I read somewhere that it was like Sid Meiers' Civilization series distilled through the filter of the HP Lovecraft universe.

the world. Here, her rebellion went largely uncontested, quickly claiming a nearby library of the high arts, hoping to attract more magic users to her cause: The Resurrection of the God of Death, Blood and Shadow. Baal. Yet, as the rebellion spread further north, the world and its forces seemed to converge as the Priestess approached the heart of the empire.\n\nEndless forests rung with the drums of hordes of goblins and looming trolls; Another, who claimed himself the 'Priest King', commanded armies of savage, exotic, bare-chested warriors and giant animals; And a Warlock, practitioner of the arcane with mercenaries of men and slaves of the elements, also sought ascension. The High-Priestess, and her armies of men and giants summoned through blood rituals, fought for control of these rich northern lands, but it seemed like total victory could never be assured.\n\nThen, a ritual was stumbled upon: One that would resurrect the God of Death Baal himself. The High Priestess wasted no time strengthening the cities and towns that provided the most blood sacrifices. The hordes of the false pretenders were held back, until, one night full of blood, shadow and sacrifice, with goblins and trolls beating their war drums in the forests only just beyond; Baal was summoned to the world once more.\n\nEntire armies fell choking on their own blood. Men, goblins, trolls and dwarfs turned on one another, or fled, before the visage of death that was Baal. Like a shadow even beneath the sun the God of Death reaved across the land, leaving precious few alive to tell the tales of those terrible battles. Those few survivors hailed from all corners of the world, but were now converted to worship only Baal. A new faith was forming.\n\nThe empire's capital soon fell to the shadow beyond the wall. Giants loyal not even to Baal himself began to rise from deep pools of blood welling from the earth. \n\nThe High Priestess revelled in the glory, though not without worry; as many of her own domains began to fall to the swords and magic of the giants. She had ushered in a new age, and was powerful enough to hold onto her own corner of the world, but for how long? Meanwhile, city after city fell before the black shadow or the huge tread of the maneaters; until there stood none to oppose them.\n\nThe War of the Pretenders was over, but as the High Priestess gazed from the highest point of her huge Temple-City dedicated to the God of Death; she wondered what place she had in the world now the deed was done.\n\nPerhaps, she would fight back. There could be room for only one God in this world.\n\nSUMMARY: Giant war between a glorious mess of fantasy cliches ended in me summoning a one-man show who slaughtered over 600 units, conquered many cities on his own and ushered in a apocalypse of giants. Tremendous fun. It satisfies an itch I've had for a relaxed strategy game but still with a lot of depth and fun. \n\nIt's like a casual Dominions 4. I'm well up for that.\n\nHonestly, if I wanted to type up every little story that ocurred during that game, this review could be twice as long easily. There was the conquering of the capital and other cities of the empire, as Baal reforged the nation that had been taken apart by enemy pretenders and the giants. Baal's recruitment of magic-users loyal to his cause. A new elite. The slaying of the Dwarven Queen and over 150 of her children by Baal. A battle with Air Elementals where Baal actually nearly died. A swim to the end of the world by an Old Man of the Sea (or something). Astral horrors spreading from a crystal birthed from a fallen comet. Baal's search for a level 3 library where he could learn better spells. The conquering of the various faction's capitals by Baal and notable battles. The defense of the ancient magical libraries from the giants in the hope of attracting different magic users. Dabbling in necromancy where one special Giant leader could summon with necromancy magic, resulting in a hybrid army..... I'll stop now.

The depth in Elysium 4 certainly has not changed, and may have increased in very subtle and important ways under the hood.\n\nThis game has some very unexpected twists.  It is generally a \"brute force over all\" - but I just had a battle against a stronger army which I thought was evenly matched until half way through the battle my forces were significantly down (maybe 1/3 of the forces he had remaining) and I decided this battle and game was probably over.  Several rounds later my forces were fallen to 2 or 3 units while he still had at least 20 - maybe 30 units or so.  Okay I've lost.\n\nBut then I noticed my units kept resurrecting in strange ways.  Maybe because these were some sort of swamp units that have regeneration.  It was weird.  It almost looked like a bug, but I think it was by design.  Each time they popped up the enemy  would instantly kill them (because the rezzed units had no health to speak of), but this kept going for many  rounds until finally he was down to only 5 or so units.  Then I noticed my rezzed units weren't dying anymore and more of them started to rez, until he was completely wiped out!\n\nWhat a surprising outcome!  So I won the battle - the enemy still had hundreds of units though and the majority of my armies were wasted, so I gave up on that game.  But getting to see that strange battle left me wanting to try it again, and take advantage of what had just happened.\n\nCons:\n- This developer is notoriously inept at optimizing the UI for the sake of minimizing mouse clicks.  Between turns you'll find yourself clicking \"ok\" over and over for dialogs that could have been put into a message log, or otherwise shown as a delay.  This is also the case for Dominions 4 and exactly why I avoided the title.  I've given up on the devs in this regard.\n\nPros:\n- In depth game elements.  The variety of technologies or gameplay elements, resource trees and unit dynamics between maybe 20 or more races is mind-blowing.  This is what I truly admire in the developers and wish they would still not overlook other parts of gameplay when this is so much their strong suite.\n\nI recommend this game.  :)  Yes buy it.", "timestamp_created": 1492274529, "timestamp_updated": 1492286416, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.701228", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30985116": {"recommendationid": "30985116", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000530094", "num_games_owned": 59, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 33096, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511831978}, "language": "french", "review": "Comme tous les jeux Illwinter c'est une petite gemme, et actuellement mon jeu le plus jou\u00e9 sur Steam.\n\nL'absence totale de contr\u00f4le sur le d\u00e9roulement des batailles qui diff\u00e9rencie la s\u00e9rie CoE de celle des Dominions ne rend le jeu que plus strat\u00e9gique et plaisant \u00e0 jouer : pas de longues phases de programmation des arm\u00e9es et des mages il s'agit juste de produire les troupes et faire \u00e9voluer les mages n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 son expansion, les envoyer au bon endroit, et surtout d'apprendre \u00e0 bien estimer leurs forces et faiblesses pour choisir ses batailles.\n", "timestamp_created": 1491507623, "timestamp_updated": 1491507623, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30619730": {"recommendationid": "30619730", "author": {"steamid": "76561198122953599", "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1690, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500845789}, "language": "english", "review": "I was surprised at the depth and complexity of this game given that the graphics are rather lacklustre.

The game has 21 classes (nations), six dimensions (being Elysium, the initial dimension, similar to the planet Earth), hundreds of units, seven kinds of universe (societies) to be generated, five different map sizes, support for up to 16 players and / or CPUs, up to six teams, 10 levels of difficulty, support for mods and full customization of UI size, graphics and sound effects. \n\nThe game's battle system is quite different, as it's not possible to command the units. Although this seems somewhat pointless in theory, in practice it works very well. Battles are resolved according to the pros and cons of each unit, their current status (blessed, cursed, poisoned, for instance) and battlefield conditions, which may contain hiding places, walls and gates, among others. This system also causes epic battles involving hundreds of units to be completed in a much shorter time than if we needed to control each unit. It is also possible to accelerate the battle or to pause it, but it will never be possible to interfere with it after its beginning, and the best phase of preparing for the fight is recruiting varied units according to the weaknesses of a certain class of enemy and adding them before the match starts. The organization of the troops is done automatically and follows a pattern, and it's not possible to take advantage or disadvantage in this aspect, so take your time while you think what kind of units must be recruted.\n\nThe graphics are all made in tilesets and are somewhat reminiscent of Tales of Maj'Eyal. The sound effects part is quite simple, being only functional, but on the other hand, the soundtrack is exceptional. Not surprisingly, the developers at Illwinter Game Design have been granted permission to use Adrian von Ziegler's songs in the game, providing an epic and Celtic atmosphere for the Elysium universe. The interface is the elephant in the room. With unconventional controls (such as movement using Q, W, E, A, D, Z, X, C instead of W, A, S, D), several essential shortcut keys, no information on options, and also the lack of tutorial, the game is certainly intimidating and practically impossible to be played efficiently without at least reading a little of its 72 page manual. The good thing is that the manual has a nice and pleasant reading, and it is not necessary to read it in its entirety. Just follow the part about the controls and the interface while playing and you're good to go. Even though it was the fourth title of the franchise, if only the game came with a small tutorial, this would help give it more visibility, making it more accessible to more people.\n\nSpeaking of gameplay, Conquest of Elysium 4 classes are so different from each other that if we learn to play with one, we will need a good time to adapt with another, because besides the universal mechanics for all of them, there are some mechanincs that are unique of certain classes. Not to mention the dimensions (called \"planes\" in the game). For instance: there's one in the game which is the true hell, with diabolical creatures and other creepy things. It is possible to travel between them, and this causes the generated maps to multiply their size by six, since they are six dimensions, and sometimes some monsters and creatures escape these dimensions and spawn at the quiet Elysium, bringing chaos and destruction to a relatively peaceful world. With all this in mind, you can have an idea of \u200b\u200bhow rich this game is.\n\nThe universe of Conquest of Elysium 4 is so extensive and deep that it is impossible to discover everything in it in just a few games. It takes dozens, if not hundreds, of hours of gaming to see everything. Even more impossible is to speak of all this in this humble review. So here's my recommendation for you to get to know the game. If you like strategy, planning and tactical thinking, take time to learn how to play this game. It's worth it.\n\n[b]Pros[/b]\n* Rich and deep universe with a ton of content\n* Many customization options, with variants for both beginners and experienced in strategy\n* Great and immersive soundtrack\n* Support for mods\n* Constant content updates\n\n[b]Cons[/b]\n* Unintuitive UI\n* Lack of tutorial", "timestamp_created": 1489450496, "timestamp_updated": 1505773898, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.627218", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30348726": {"recommendationid": "30348726", "author": {"steamid": "76561197975702219", "num_games_owned": 1049, "num_reviews": 124, "playtime_forever": 1484, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510685986}, "language": "english", "review": "A fun Little strategy game with its own uniuqe twists on fantasy tropes and gags.

A baron with his knights and crossbowmen actually plays differently from a druid who uses the powers of nature. I don't mind little flaws - e.g. I did not understand how a single wild deer could prevent a whole village from yielding taxes until you conquer it a second time. I do mind that the AI does very stupid things occasionally, but I have yet to see a strategy game where this is not the case, so this is forgivable.\n\nA big minus, however, is the fact that you do not get to command your troops in battle. This feature, or rather lack of features, was the biggest disappointment for me. It all plays out automatically, with a step-by-step battle report on the side (which impairs my immersion, because it is stat-related and technical). You cannot even give basic commands like \"retreat\" or \"defensive stance\". Neither can you influence the battle formation, and in large armies, that can lead to archers being useless because your own ranks in front of them prevent enemies from getting into shooting range. Maybe, the developer wanted to spare the player too much micromanagement, but this could have easily been solved by making such interventions optional. Also, I do not understand why castles and watchtowers are all represented exactly the same. At least, you don't have to watch every skirmish play out, but can increase speed or skip to the final result, which I ended up doing regularly after an hour.\n\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\n\nThis quite decent retro indie game does not actually offer a lot of production value, but it manages to stimulate your imagination to make up narratives while you experience a minimalistic strategy game with an exceptional variety of different units. 6.5/10.", "timestamp_created": 1484833862, "timestamp_updated": 1498133249, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.592529", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29296599": {"recommendationid": "29296599", "author": {"steamid": "76561198136275532", "num_games_owned": 144, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 4080, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506952042}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Um jogo muito interessante para quem gosta de RPG de ra\u00edz.\n\n1.

Every peice on the board matters, and every soldier is represented. The sheer number of units and strategies available puts other 4X's to shame. Yes, it is not as pretty as the latest Civilization, it's battles are not as detailed as Sins of a Solar Empire, but if eye candy is not generally a selling point for you, Conquest of Elysium 4 will reward with hours upon hours of intense strategic gameplay. Most people seem to like when I do a Pro/Con list, so here you go.\n\nPROS:\n\n-20 different factions with a variety of play styles for each one, ranging from a medival baron leading knighs and foot soldiers, to cults of tentacle beasts, to dryads leading continuously spawning hordes of upgradable beastmen. There's something for everyone. Yes, everyone.\n\n-6 maps every game, most of which you will never visit, but are there in case you have to, or want to. Elysium not enough? Take over the other realms as well.\n\n-A wide variety of terrain features and five time periods (as well as hidden alternate timelines) makes every game different and unique.\n\n-Different resources required for each faction. A baron will require mines for metal to make armor, an enchanter will require them for gemstones for constructs, and druids won't care, because they will use herbs from forests for thier summons. In fact, resource denying other factions by destroying resources yours don't use is an oft effective strategy. \n\n-A wide variety of magic, with availablity differing among the numerous factions, creating another layer of strategy as each faction tries to get thier wizards to godlike power, or prevent others from doing so. \n\n-So many individual units you'll only have seen all of them after having played many games.\n\nCONS:\n\n- RNG plays a significant role in terms of events and resource/terrain placement. Some will like it, other's wont. I tend to, but it can get annoying when your playing a 6 player game and you get relegated to the center of the map, inbetween the other 5, and right next to the most powerful neutral towns. \n\n- Neutral unit spam. Another matter of contention between players. Some like it, others don't, and it can be controlled through the use of the time periods, and close attention to realm logisitics. Still, it doesn't make having to recapture that same settlement for the 4th time because a group of stealth theives jumped your village idiots, again, any less annoying.\n\n- The AI, though aggressive, and properly able to manage it's empire, is often... just plain stupid. Sometimes opponents will be eliminated just a few turns after the game begins because they didn't bother defending thier starting settlement, or thought running their last general into a dragon was a good idea.\n\n\n\nTLDR: Conquest of Elysium is a 4X that may lack in graphics but more than makes up for it in depth of gameplay. With so many options, it promises to be a different game each time, while telling a story of heroism, tact, or just plain bumbling (and hilarious) faliure.\n\n-Mightyfox has been eliminated from the game.

Sieze resource and magic sites, build up your army, and conquer. Yet at the same time it is also a game about discovery, about unlocking new magic and forces, about discovering new locations, and trying to make it gel together to become more powerful - and often without knowing for certain exactly what you can unlock as you progress. It's an entertaining premise on a simple turn based format that flows effortlessly forwards.\n\nAs with the Dominions series, part of the real joy of the Illwinter games is the imagination and ideas that are included, and this game is no exception. The game's graphics are basic but in the main work well - though as monitors get bigger it is coming to a time where the beautiful sprites are simply too small. Illwinter's UIs also still need much work, but the apparent simplicity of the game belies something more complex under the hood - yet with the enormous advantage that you don't have to delve into the numbers and abilities unless you want to.\n\nEach starting race/character plays very differently, and Illwinter truly understand that the art of 4x is to ensure that discovery remains past the early part of the game - and on this Elysium delivers in trumps. It's not an easy game though - don't run into the gamer's habit of picking any of the higher difficulties; you will be frustrated!\n\nWhat's it worth? \u00a317 / $20", "timestamp_created": 1479737391, "timestamp_updated": 1486237280, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26637691": {"recommendationid": "26637691", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054506788", "num_games_owned": 359, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 7102, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510756796}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a deep but very easy to play strategy game. \nThe best part is how well this game fleshes out each faction. \nIt's not often a game really makes factions so different from one another, but here playing a necromancer really feels like it, and playing a druid really feels like that.

To tell the truth I didn't think I'd like it because glancing over the manual gave me the impression of over complexity. And let's play videos, for some reson, don't do the game justice. Also reviews by prestigious reviewers all say that, athough CoE4 is simplified and streamlined compared to Dominions, the game is still very hard (to win, not to play). \n\nWell I had to give it a try and I picked it up expecting to be bored, confused, irritated, and to get a refund before the 2-hour limit. But as I was advised in the Steam forums, CoE4 game is not too hard to pick up, but to play well takes a lot of time and effort. As for the manual...What I mistook for complexity was instead explanations of the depth and finer points of the game. Listening to the advice in the forum, I read the parts about movement,  recruitment and commanders. That got me started quickly. Then in between playing of a few short sessions, I read over the other parts to answer my questions and to learn the finer points.\n\nWell my 2 hours are up and that is all it took for me to fall in loe with CoE4.

Oh, and converted all the graphics to crappy little 2D icons.\n\nHere's some problems with this game.\n\nYou can't recruit anywhere except your capital, and some very specific other locations, such as guard towers, and broken castles. This is only a problem because if you don't happen to have any of these near your front lines, you are going to have to run your troops up (who only have 3 moves a turn which isn't very many) all the way up. And another thing. Because you have to have a commander commanding your troops, you need to have some guy ready to ferry those troops up, and you can't just buy a commander at any time, no, of course not. So say you need to replenish your troops on your fighting commander guy. You need to go all the way back to your capital or whatever recruitment building is closest, train your troops over as many turns as you need to get back up to strength, and then you can get back to fighting. This is a problem only because you can't recruit from villages. Even big named villages. It makes no sense.\n\nThis is enough for me to not recommend this game.\n\nThere's also without a doubt some balance issues. There's also no such thing as overexpansion. There's no downside to building an empire as ungodly huge as you can build it. There doesn't feel like a lot of depth to this game beyond the combat.\n\nActually watching a huge combat unfold is pretty cool, it's kind of a shame that you can't direct any of your units or anything, especially since you're going to see your wizards doing shit like using a big damage single target spell on a frog or something, as opposed to the massive hill giant next to him. But that's okay, since there wouldn't be a way to fix this.\n\nThe actual universe is... interesting to say the least. It's always nice to see classic fantasy. You can also play as the Innsmouth cult, basically, from Lovecraft canon. So that's cool. But then you've got... weird shit. Like giant moose and such which can trample an entire army, or take your cities and such.\n\nAnother thing that is really really annoying is that there's no militia or anything raised to protect a town. Nothing. You can just walk onto a space, and you own it. I get that this is a kind of thing one or two of the 'races' have, but it's still stupid. I'm not even talking something serious. I just want to see SOME kind of resistance, so a single wolf or something can't run into a town and take control of the whole thing.\n\nI don't know, I don't want to compare this so much to Total War, but that's how it goes, this is pretty damn close to the Total War formula. Except it's only about conquering.\n\nLet's talk about some of the rumours of 'depth' and 'tactics' - now let me tell your right here and now there really isn't much of either of these. There's no micromanagement except for your commander units, like you can equip these guys with certain magical things you find... if you ever find any. My last game I found two. Just two. One on a hero I bought, was some crappy mushroom spawning thing, and the other was a lightning staff from an enchantress I murdered, which was pretty cool actually.\n\nThere's no paper scissors rock type triangle, spears aren't extra strong versus cavalry, there's no flanking bonuses, nor are there bonuses for attacking from behind, obviously, and because of this, Conquest of Elysium has little to no depth whatsoever. \n\nDon't praise a game for things it doesn't really have.\n\nHowever, this is gonna be a thumbs up now.

Conquest of Elysium 3 was good in itself, I played a lot with it and enjoyed it. That said, I don't play thousands of hours with a single game, I'm more diversed in the way of gaming I have. But this game is absolutely worth it! Illwinter Game Design made it. They are responsible for the Dominions series as well. That is more complex. This game is simpler, but that does not mean that it is simple! In fact it is not simple at all! You have either tons of units to recruit or tons of units to achieve with your special resources through Rituals of Masteries. It is more straightforward than Dominions. but it's depth is even deeper than many of the turn-based strategies today. There are zounds of units either under your control, or seeing the game as a whole. You have a choice from the beginning. What you want to do defines the gameplay for the 20 classes not mentioned before. These 20 classes range from Necromancers to Barbarians, through Senators and Demonologists, to name a few. I said before recruitment. You either have a lot to recruit from (but usually only one per turn can be recruited, with a few exceptions) or you have not many, but you can collect resources and expand your abilities named Rituals. Mostly, there are three levels of rituals. You can repeat a Ritual of Mastery many times, but the result will always be random, granting it infinite replayability! But it's the usual explore, exploit, expand, exterminate formula many times did before. I recommend it highly to anyone, who didn't try it before and is good at English. You should definitely give this game a try and let you get charmed by the atmosphere and music it has. You can play with your friends online or at the same computer at the same time!

In fact most of your thinking is risk management rather than tactical management. Instead of picking a civilization like in most 4X games, you actually pick a character. The characters all have different ways of interacting with the world and they recruit armies to carry out their way of defeating their foes.\n\n[b]Upsides[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Simple to play but MAN is there a lot of little things that can change things! You don't nessecarily USE it all depending on your character. \n\nExample: You may be a Witch who has to run around, capturing forests so you have more fungi to collect to cast your spells, however unlike say, a Baron, you don't really have the income to raise a huge standing army, but you can cast powerful spells unlike the Baron!\n\n[*] Suprisingly solid RNG Based Automated battles. Yes you read that right as an upside. It is true, once the fighting starts, you have no control, but the strategy is about risk management before the fight (\"Can I really take on these 12 dwarves with my Calvary Army?\") and then the game automates a battle in a kind of \"Auto 2D total war like\" scenario, which is really neat! Plus the game competently puts your soldiers in formation (Tanky heavy-hitters in the middle, skirmishers in the flanks, archers and spellcasters in the rear) and they act as you would expect the unit would in a fight!\n\n[*] The soundtrack!\n[/list]\n\n[b]Your mileage may vary[/b]\n[list]\n[*]Yes it looks like it Came from the 90's, I'm ok with this personally, but again YMMV.\n[/list]\n\n[b]Main Downsides[/b]\n[list]\n[*] It doesn't explain the basics at all. There is no tutorial and help only appears after your first year, and it's always about random factoids rather than how to play. The best way to learn how to play is to watch someone else play it on youtube. That said it is actually simple enough to actually play despite the depth this game has.\n\n[*] UI is sometimes a awkward to use.

And then get lost in the void, go insane, and fight horrors until you die.\n\nFor those who havent:\n\n- The game is well drawn but not graphically advanced. It never bothered me. Think of it like an eletronic boardgame.\n- It is an adventure of a hero and his army. And everyone in the army can pick up the advanced weapon and be a hero.

It's as close as you're going to get, and that is very high praise.\n\n\n\nSecond Update 27 Feb 2016 (thumbed down): \n\nHaving sunk a bunch more time into this (offline mode, I probably have fifty hours offline), I'm ready to thumb it down. It's tedious. MoM was never tedious to me. There is a non-stop barrage of deer, snakes, wild life, and wandering nobodies that continually take your farms, forests, and anything else you could have possibly laid claim to. For no good reason. Two wandering deer do not chase people from their farm. \n\nIt's a non-stop game of recapture. You leave three guys to defend the farm? Four bears show up and kill them. If that's not bad enough, there are actual random factions and events that pop up for the sole purpose of spitting random extra monsters across your lands.\n\nIf you start a game with five AI, three of them will be killed by neutral \"armies\" (deer) in the first dozen turns or so. As far as I can tell, the only difference you get for ramping the AI difficulty up is that they start with bigger armies (and probably get cheaty amounts of resources per turn).\n\nI assume I'm just bad at the game still, but there's no excuse for the amount of rubbish that exists just to force you to keep recapturing the same thing over and over.\n\n\n\nThird Review  7 Jan 2017 (thumbed up): \n\nYou should probably own this game.  It's pretty damn good.  What I said before holds true, but it's possible they've tweaked the deer attacks so that there are less of them.  I think there's an option now to make more of them.  Play slower, keep all heros active and with at least a very small army so you can run around recapturing things.\n\nIf you like 4X games where there are lots of different characters / play styles, you can't go wrong with this one.", "timestamp_created": 1451766027, "timestamp_updated": 1483854140, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.536232", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20200528": {"recommendationid": "20200528", "author": {"steamid": "76561198111715771", "num_games_owned": 43, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 5735, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500621985}, "language": "english", "review": "Even though it appears deceptively simple at first and it is not as complex or deep as Dominion, it is pure strategy at work.

If there is no space for them to exist in, they get spawned on the opposite side of the map...where they usually are killed..or may get lucky and kill the casters of the enemy due to this bug.

I can't say any of the two classes really play the same, at all really, which is a plus since there's currently 20 classes.\n\nEarly game is a bit hard for certain classes, but if you can get through it, those factions usually become much much stronger later on than the ones that have an easier time early game, so risk vs reward... all it takes is one lucky hit for a troll king to be slaughtered in one blow, (open ended dice means that if you roll a 1d5 for damage, and roll a 5{maximum} a 5 will be added, you roll again, each consecutive 5 after this adds 4 {5-1} damage, which can stack infinitively, causing a possibility for a single levie/random miltia to slaughter a troll king/dragon in one blow...) which brings another point, this game is very heavily RNG based, don't expect to win every game even if you have a near flawless strategy and are in an overwhelming lead, something can happen that can turn the entire game around in an instant... Remember, it's a game, so play to have fun, even if a meteor strikes on your biggest army in the middle of nowhere, or a gate to inferno opens and your army is slaughtered by demons.\n\nI'd consider this game a turn-based warcraft if you will, much better mechanics involved here (if a descriptor says it does something, it does it... be sure to read certain descriptions, like for ghouls; if a ghoul feeds on another person, that person will also turn into a ghoul if they die, this isn't shown as an ability, but it's clearly depicted in the description.), all in all one of the best, definitely top 2 strategy games I've played, the other also being an illwinter game (Dominions 4), so if you love strategy and want a quick skirmish (though, games still do take the better part of an hour or three if playing on medium with 3 players;) then this is the game. Dominions 4 is better for longer games and has more management aspects overall, but I'd almost argue that the combat, though unable to be as finely tuned (with scripting spells and army order) is better here, since you can clearly see all units depicted on each of their own tiles, the visual noise isn't too crazy, you can see each and every target getting hit, and the combat log is full of information for each battle.\n\nhrm, getting a bit off track, not the best at writing reviews but yeah, definitely recommend this one,\n\np.s. the soundtrack is AMAZING, wish it came in mp3 or something so we could listen to it any time.", "timestamp_created": 1449182254, "timestamp_updated": 1449661154, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.531162", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19458415": {"recommendationid": "19458415", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027116005", "num_games_owned": 302, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 22831, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 456, "last_played": 1514327128}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game, my daughter loves this game.

Worth the price for an upgrade?  Well, if you played the crap out of the last one, you'll probably play the crap out of this one too.  The additions and upgrades are, in my opinion, definitely worth it, although I wish the game could have been a little cheaper.  Same great classes as last game, and even a couple new ones, which are interesting, but not really insanely awesome either.  First differences you'll notice are the changes to the battle system.  It's much more fluid and interesting to watch.  Also, you now have a little bit more control over your characters' development throughout the game.  Libraries (as far as I can tell)  can be used forever, so as long as you have the gold, you can just keep learning new spells. They can also be used to upgrade those cool mercenary wizard characters that are recruitable from time to time.\n There are also different worlds you can visit, like hades, inferno, some elemental planes, and probably more that I haven't cared to remember, each with their own landscapes and towns and citadels to recruit from.  Overall a very fun time.  I was addicted to 3, and now I'm addicted to 4, and they added and changed most of the things that I was hoping they'd change in 3.\n\nMultiplayer works, but it's another game that seems to make it a pain in the ass to set up. It's basically a direct connect type of game, and if you don't like dealing with port forwarding,  you're going to have to use something like hamachi. Hosting requires you to start another instance of the game, which can be tricky in steam, but doable if you just run the .exe from the game folders.  I  haven't played too much multi yet, but the only downside I've encountered are the continuous restarts from you or your friend dying early.\n\n\nIf you haven't played CoE3 or really any of Illwinter's games, I can only really describe it as a game where you spend the majority of your time finding ways to put cool new monsters or soldiers in your army, and then send them into what are basically live action autocalc battles.  Might sound lame if you are into games where you play a more active role, like the total war franchise, but the fact that you have no control over it once the battle begins adds to the roguelike quality of the game.  Your favorite character will often die and leave their apprentice.  Sometimes your giant army killing troll king will be cursed within the first few rounds of play, and have that curse for the rest of the game.  Even though the game offers less freedom of choice in battles, it still has so much variety that you won't even care.\n\nIf you want a game that will run on pretty much anything and be capable of stealing hours and hours of your life from you, then I highly recommend this.", "timestamp_created": 1449149055, "timestamp_updated": 1449149894, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19448415": {"recommendationid": "19448415", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020143528", "num_games_owned": 94, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 9957, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483158297}, "language": "french", "review": "Hi\nVoila un jeu bien etrange;\nOn le penserait presque sorti d'un jeune chapeau de vieux strat\u00e8ge!\nL'univers a l'air neuf mais les rouages sont d'un ancien monde: tout est g\u00e9r\u00e9 en combat par l'ordinateur et vous n'avez d'intervention que dans le nombre de\"soldats\" que vous envoyez...L'I.A qui g\u00e9re ensuite le combat est tout simplement presque al\u00e9atoire et il ne reste aucune certitude que vos troupes ayant le plus d'experience s'en sorte plus...Chaque adversaire ayant avec un tirage \"de chance\", non visible la possibilit\u00e9 de tuer al\u00e9atoirement un alli\u00e9e...Autant dire qu'entre toutes les \"races\", celle proposant soit des troupes aux niveaux de vie plus \u00e9l\u00e9v\u00e9s, soit des alli\u00e9es invoqu\u00e9s, ont carement plus de chance...Byebye les nains trop l\u00e9gers..et comme vous \u00eates dans un sch\u00e9ma de course \u00e0 celui qui a le plus de troupes, il est a preferer encore les troupes qui popent moins souvent mais qui resistent!

Formula is simple: player must gather army, gain control on resource spots and destroy all other factions. There is very simple economy, no construction, no even a sign of diplomacy and research. But there are many factions, units and spells, clashed in endless uncompromising battle.\n\nVariety of factions is the best part of Conquest of Elysium. Game has twenty factions, each of them has its own unique style and gameplay, they even require different resources. Just a pair of examples: while trolls roam the forest in search of fungi, humans are trying to burn the groves, for their armies forest is nothing more than an obstacle in path. Demonologists gather sacrifice, hoping to call powerful allies from Inferno. Priests of El convert settlements in right faith, while their leader seeks to bring the Apocalypse. Each faction plays differently and it is really good.\n\nMaps are randomly generated, considering a variety of factions and units it ensures that each new game will be different from previous. Game offers a large number of combinations, so it will not be boring.\n\nAI is decent. It is obvious that on higher difficulty levels AI receives bonuses, so he can collect very powerful forces. For me it was not easy to play with AI even on medium difficulty, game is challenging enough.\n\nUnfortunately, from my point of view, Conquest of Elysium is far from perfect. First of all, i do not have enough control of units. I can not design formation for my troops. In combat, units just rush forward and beat each other; in same time, valuable warriors such as mounted commanders or heroes are often in first lines, so they die in vain.\n\nWizards cast spells at random and it is impossible to predict what spell your magician will cast next turn. Will it be powerful attack, able to destroy half of the enemy squad, or it will be something completely useless? Random knows! I really want to see a system that allows to customize the formation and tactics of units. Such system is implemented in other game created by Illwinter - Dominions, and i hope to see something like that.\n\nBalance is not perfect too. A lot depends on the generation of map. If settlements are rare then human Baron or priests or El will be very weak, because they can not realize their full potential. If there is no forests, then trolls will not have enough resources to their powerful spells. Map generator can place a powerful monster right next to your capital and you can not do anything about it. And so on.\n\nAs for monsters. Neutral creatures, roaming around, can sometimes attack your settlements. This is not surprising, but i do not understand how lone deer can capture fortress. Even if there is no soldiers, but deers can not climb the walls, and why they need to attack fortress anyway? I may give advice to beginners: do not leave your capital unprotected, unless you want it to be captured by moose or snake or a band of hamsters from nearby meadow.\n\nA lot depends on luck. Your best wizard can be smashed by stone from a catapult during the minor siege of small fortress; your brave commander, leader of elite infantry squad, can decide that it is good idea to attack pack of wolves without waiting for footmen; puny serpent can poison your favorite dragon or giant... a lot of things can go wrong. Well, from my perspective, it adds some spice to the game.\n\nGraphics looks dated. In fact, i am calm about graphics, but... just imagine how great Conquest of Elysium would look with modern engine... well, this is just dreams.\n\nAnyway. Despite all flaws, Conquest of Elysium brought me a lot of pleasure, i want to play this game again and again. If you enjoy turn-based strategic games in fantasy style, i can safely recommend this game to you.

Would recommend. I tried it for the first time last night and couldn't go to bed until I won a game.\n\n\nSTORY TIME:\nI must admit- I went into this game feeling a bit reserved. \n\nI did everything random my first time, got the Troll King, and because I thought he was completely bad-ass, went out after the first mob I saw. (It was a wraith or something similar.) It performed an ability that ONE-SHOT me. I was a little put off because he was supposed to be the toughest to start off with, but he got basically bloodstained by a ghostly apparition. \n\nI thought it was a fluke. (Probably not- I'm new to the game and probably did something wrong.) \n\nSo I tried again, and the randomizer gave me the Demonologist. And here is where I started to see the game begin to shine. I slowly but steadily started to built an army of demons- starting off with different flavors of imp, then cautiously working my way up to hell-hounds, devils, and vast clouds of demonic locusts. I would take over magtic sites and began to clothe myself with items that would do things like summon lesser imps at the beginning of battle. With glee I would summon demon knights and watch as army after army began to fall before the hordes of wrath I had summoned. Great swaths of flame scoured huge holes in enemy lines and they rapidly crumbled. Ruling the world with my demonic army became a goal that I could not put down. The barbarians were the first to fall. Soon, my army would destroy the Burgmeister and his beer-swilling ants of ... men.  Even watching the sprites wage war on each other, I could imagine the Inferno slowly starting to take over this world. Even after I destroyed my enemies- I felt an insatiable desire to start up another Demonologist to go forth and sacrifice untold thousands to explore anything else this class had to offer. \n\nJust a few more thoughts:\n-the above was based on all enemies being on default difficulty. \n-I took over the world with a Demonologist that wasn't even maxed on ability. (What could I do with a maxed out character? I don't know, but intend to find out!)  \n-I had the option to go to another plane, but because I wanted to win the battle on my plane, I chose not to explore to see what was there, but completely had the option to do so.\n-The independent mobs can be a little annoying. I found it best to create a few small mini-armies to go around and destory them. \n-there's a LOT left to learn. I had an incredibly satisfying game. \n-read the manual.

I started (after about 4 fail starts where I lost my starting army to fire ants or a disease demon cohort) in a desert and grabbed a few little farms and converted them.

The other day i seen this was out and most reviews said it was a much improved version so i decided to skip part 3 and buy this. Since i never played part 3 to justify buying this i decided that i had to play this one first day of purchase rather than leaving it in back catalogue to be forgotten.\n\nAll i can say is this i recently bought black ops 3 and star wars and tomb raider and i have to force myself to play them as they can get boring fast yet this game i put on yesterday and i played it for close to 10 hours on my first day. I couldnt turn it off pretty much its so addictive. The only thing that made me turn it off was i realised it was after midnight and i had to be up at 6am the next morning.\n\nI have already put this game in my favourites the game is great.

It has its quirks (no control in combat), but the replay is huge.  All the classes actually do play differently! The \"Voice of El\" collects relics from settlements and uses them to increase his holy bonus and gain (random) units from El in his settlements.  The more \"seals\" broken (7 in total for the world), the closer the world gets to El and the more powerful units you get for free.  You can also spend money to convert settlements to your faith.  Even if an enemy recaptures it, it'll still pay you money every year (in a lump sum)! \n\nThen there are the dwarves.  They lack any \"standard\" recruitment, but gain a free dwarf every turn birthed from your Dvala (whcih can't leave its mountain home).  You then spend iron to upgrade your workers.  You gain less gold from settlements, but more iron from mines.  Mines also yield gems to power rituals or further upgrae your troops.  The mountain-mines also count as citadels (recruitment centers) that you can install more Dvala's into (for more free troops).  \n\nThe point is that the El faction will fight tooth and nail for large settlements to fuel their relic addiction, and while they need mines for higher-tier troops, its not critical for them.  Dwarves on the other hand, can't even collect relics.  They also get barely any gold from settlements but can't get enough iron/gems for upgrades.  Thus, its fairly typical for a dwarf  to ignore settlements and only take them away from other players.  Even if they capture a city, they can't recruit units out of it for defense (other than sporadic, expensive, mercenary options).  Nor can they upgrade their base workers in one.  So two factions that can' be bothered with the others' resource, and have their own mechanics for progress and expansion.  These are just two of the ~20 factions found in the game, too! \n\nAbout the combat though... while there is no real control, units still move about the grid and have varying ranges on their attacks.  They also try to fit in various ranks (front/middle/rear).  So you can have a cluster of rear-castesr that would otherwisse be secure behind two ranks of infantry.  However, if you think a few powerful frontliners are all you need, superior enemies can flank around them and gank your casters- this is particularly true for swarms of fast wolves.  Also, you can have infrantry ranks so thick that your archers can't fire over them, or casters that kill your own units with your spells! For the latter you have to turn those off, or only use resistant troops in the front ranks.  However, light frost damage ove the battlefield can be worth it if your enemy has tons of 3-4 hp fodder (goblins)... Your troops survive, they get decimated.  On the world map, they can have different move speeds and movement types.  So like in Age of Wonders, you can put together an amphibous army to attack from the coast-line, or a mountain-moving army able to quickly hit/run through a mountain range.  Also, some units are slow and others are fast.

I succeeded in doing this, but hell's legions were persistent, and kept reopening the gates.

Some troops have better synergy than others. con - lack of control, pro - no micromanagement. Which matters more to you is pretty subjective depending on what you're looking to get out of the game.\n\nIt's random and you can get terrible starting positions or great ones. You'll get key troop offers when you need them or maybe not. If that happened in a 40 hour Civ game, it'd be annoying. In a few hour Civ-lite, it just means some runs are more challenging than others.\n\nIt's not really a rogue-like, but it has that feel to it. Quick turns, very limited numbers of controllable units (often 1-2 stacks for much of the early game). Lots of random independent critters to kill.

The essential gameplay is very similar (identical) but the new battle system is a fantastic addtion. There's other new things, but there very specific...they all make the game a little nicer to play. If you like Illwinter's stuff you probably have already bought it. If your not familar, and like fantasy strategy games, I whole heartedly reccomend starting with Conquest of Elysium 4. \n\nOne of the things that Conquest of Elysium 3 did so well was making each faction feel unique to play. Conquest of Elysium 4 nails this too. A good way to illustrate this is to explain the different resources that factions need to collect and spend. All factions need gold and iron, collected from farms, towns and mines. Different factions require different components to cast their faction specific spells and special abilities. The demonologist, for example, needs blood from blood sacrifices (obtained from the unlucky town inhabitants), whereas the necromancer needs Hands of Glory (which are the pickled left hands of those hanged until death \u2013 collected from gallows and cemeteries), druids need herbs and troll shamans need fungi (both of which can be found in forests and jungles). Each faction needs towns and mines, but different factions will hunt out different sites of interest for their components. Druids will patrol up and down forests (being invisible to other factions while in them), controlling as much of the foliage as they can. Trolls don\u2019t need the foliage of trees to get their mushrooms, so they can set the druids\u2019 much-needed forests on fire. Demonologists will ignore the forests on the hunt for more towns while Necromancers will search out grisly gallows and cemeteries. The druids will flit through the trees, conducting their animal summoning rituals in secrecy while the other factions march around the forests in search of different goals. That is unless they don\u2019t decide to set the forests on fire to clear the druids out.\n\nThe special abilities and spells of the factions also help to create the sense of uniqueness. The Druid will command a massive horde of summoned animals bolstered by bare-chested warriors and slingers \u2013 all with the ability to be invisible when surrounded by trees. The Troll King has the ability to not only regenerate, but to single-handedly pulverize small armies, his recruitable goblins die extremely easily though. The Troll King is also always joined by a Troll Mum, a troll shaman unhappy with her son\u2019s ability at waging war. The Necromancer can summon large numbers of the undead for almost free, the only cost being to his sanity. Necromancers are able to cheaply amass a huge number of troops but will often refuse to move for a turn due to bouts of insanity. Conquest of Elysium 4 does an amazing job of translating the lore and personality of a faction into unique ways of playing the game.\n\nThe new battle system illustrates the clashes between these factions much better than the previous edition of the game. Rather than a black void, units now fight on a terrain appropriate square graphed map. Grass, rocks, snow, caves, and walled fortifications are represented. Units themselves are viewed from the top down and will move with respect to the other units and terrain conditions around them. Like the previous edition, the player has no direct control over their units. When a fight starts, the units are on autopilot, moving and fighting their way across the battle field. The only control the player has as a general is to decide which units are given to what movable commander. The system is elegant and refreshingly straightforward once you get used to it. \n\n(Parts of this Steam Review are taken from my review here: http://www.hbhud.com/2015/11/17/review-of-conquest-of-elysium-4/ )", "timestamp_created": 1447804244, "timestamp_updated": 1448154739, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 26, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.682645", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19135561": {"recommendationid": "19135561", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030880720", "num_games_owned": 405, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 2156, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498947497}, "language": "english", "review": "It's an improved version of CoE3\n\nThe additions are really neat, and it's pure pleasure to discover everything the game has to offer.\n\nTurns are quick, and so is death.

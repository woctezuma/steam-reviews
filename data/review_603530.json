The game feel itself is almost note for note \"Super Metroid\", which isn\u2019t a bad thing at all [why fix what isnt broken]\nThe story for a robot named fight is pretty unique and interesting, featuring a decent amount of enemy variety with unique behaviors, a modest assortment of bosses, and a soundtrack with a few hit pieces, and others that are enough to get the job done.\n\nThe layouts and powerups place within each level are procedurally generated, Resulting is a large variety of possible unique playthroughs. One of my favorite experiences with the game is in discovering how all the powerups are going to synergize and work together in any given run.\nThe procedural generation also impacts how much backtracking you may or may not be doing in a run, and how many powerups will be tucked away until the last stretch of a game if you go for that 100% collection rate.\n\nThe game is designed around being able to be replayed multiple times and be enjoyable. A large portion of powerups have to be unlocked, and completing certain achievements in the game gives you a slight chance to start with a powerup or two at the start of any new run. [also randomized] So each new run you end up playing becomes more and more diverse as you unlock content.\n\nAll in all, it boils down to this: If you enjoy Metroid, rougelike platformers, or metroidvania\u2019s, you\u2019ll want to pick this game up. The dev recently released free content patch to the game at the start of december, adding a variety of new items and content to the game, and seems intent on continuing to add to his game moving forward [although there isn\u2019t any mention of this on the store page], but the game is certainly a complete package as is, that may very well become worth even more as time marches forward.\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1513695410, "timestamp_updated": 1513695410, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38261421": {"recommendationid": "38261421", "author": {"steamid": "76561198089721705", "num_games_owned": 123, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 345, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 66, "last_played": 1513647489}, "language": "french", "review": "Quand Samus s'absente c'est la fin du monde, non serieusement un bon Metro\u00efd/Roguer-like sympathique avec une vari\u00e9t\u00e9 d'objet cacher \u00e0 trouver, des bons boss \u00e0 affronter, une ambiance glauque asse sympathique, et les OST sont pas mal aussi.

A Robot Named Fight not only uses the Metroidvania formula, but it also plays just like Super Metroid with Rougelike elements as well.  If you've ever played Super Metroid, then it would be instantly familiar to you how the gameplay is.  \n\nThe rougelike elements that are present are randomly generated maps, randomly placed power-ups, shops that grant upgrades, and perma-death.  Everytime you die you start over from the beginning, which makes dying pretty devastating whenever it happens.  There are unlockables that can be acquired whenever you earn achievements, which makes earning them even more worthwhile.  Once you start unlocking them, then you will most likely see them in a future run.  For example, later playthroughs can have special rooms that will revive you if you can reach and use them before dying.  \n\nThere are many traverse upgrades that you will find to further progress into the game.  There are several variations of each traverse upgrade that perform the same function, but perform differently.  For example, some areas are inaccessable due to the fact that your character can't jump high enough.  You may either get a double jump, or get a high jump in that run to progress further.\n\nPermanent power-ups can be found throughout the whole map, which are similar to stat upgrades like in The Binding of Isaac.  You will need to shoot different parts of the terrain to uncover them, just like in Metroid.  There are also different allies that you will come across that can help you with upgrades and items if you provide them the scrap they need to make it.  The allies act as the shops of the game.\n\nThe game can last around between 45 minutes to 1 hour in each playthrough, or even shorter depending on how fast you can get through the game.  The game can also be played in local co-op where a friend can control an orb that can fire at enemies for you.

I love the artstyle and the tone. Unfortunately the game falls a bit short in the gameplay and procedural generation. Some of my thoughts for improvement.\n\nPositive\n+ The visuals and music go well together and really brings some nostalgia. \n+ Artstyle is spot on. Monster design is great and creepy. Nice effects and lighting.\n+ Mood\n+ Story, simple, cheesy but effective\n+ You unlock more items for future playthorughs.\n+ Lots of upgrades\n\nNeutral\n+- Jumps are a bit to floaty.\n+- Areas can be a bit to cramped.\n+- Music wasn't varied enough and got old after a while.\n\nNegative\n- Stiff controls, That is - the character is too slow and unresponsive at the start. \nBoth the movementspeed and rate of fire. A rouge like game should be smooth and when you die you should want to start another round. The sluggish beginning really takes that away. I get that the developers wanted to give a sense of progression but it's just to slow and really takes away from the gameplay expereince. The first minutes of shooting blobs of flesh is really tedious.\n- The Invincibilityframes are to few.\nEven after getting more speed and control over your character a few enemies close together can be your demise. You get stunned when hit and can't react before you get hit again. It feels really unfair and frustrating. A small change that would make a huge quality of life difference.\n- Projectile speed should be faster than movementspeed.\n-  I liked that you could get different items to solve the same problem. Double jump, super jump or maybe even just a dash. The procedural generation could improve in certain aspects though. I found myself getting way to many gun/beam upgrades. Wish didn't bring much variety. Hav having atleast 3 mobility items in a playthorugh could be a good cap.\n- Bossbattle design \nIt's difficult to make good bosses. But I don't think that this is the games problem. Its the other points above that keep the bossfights from feeling fun and engaging. A more fluid movement system would do wonders in creating more fluid and dynamic bossfights even with the current patterns and animation.\n\nI really love the idea of the game and certain elements are steller. The effects, animation, artstyle. Certain parts of the procedural generation. But in the end I found the controls and gameplay to frustrating to keep coming back for more.

Metroid is built on its huge, interconnected, explorable map. This game's map generation, though, is severely lacking. It's structured fairly linearly, requiring you to visit each separate area in strict sequence. The open-ended exploration consists mostly of tiny offshoots of the main path through the world. The controls and abilities in the game pale to Super Metroid, as well. Most upgrades you find consist of small, piecemeal boosts like \"slightly faster firing speed\" or \"slightly more shot damage\". While there are many types of weapons and abilites you won't find in a Metroid title, none of them are all that fun to use, and there's a lot of function overlap in the upgrade pool. Also, a good portion the upgrades within a given map are just glorified money to buy upgrades from randomly placed shops in the map. Given the roguelike nature of the game, speedrunning, a staple Metroid tradition, is all but impossible. The game also does its best to completely prevent sequence-breaking, another favorite Metroid tradition. All in all, it's not a good Metroid title, considering how much it tries to be like one.\n\nA lot of this game's weaknesses are a result of its roguelike elements. Sadly, those elements don't make up for those weaknesses. Map generation follows such a strict set of rules that there's little variety between runs, meaning the main strength of a roguelike is completely lost on this game. The world has the same general structure, with the same area types, every playthrough. You go right, through the city, down into the cave, left through the factory, down into a destroyed city, then all the way back up to the final boss. The weapons lack variety, as well. Most main weapons are just a slightly different projectile. The sub-weapons widely vary in use and function, but there's usually little reason to use them as opposed to the main beam, as it often gets upgraded so much there's no reason to not use it. Despite being a roguelite, A Robot Named Fight has so little variety that each run feels largely the same.\n\nTo top it all off, the game is pretty easy. In the time it took me to get the real ending, which requires six or seven successful runs, I only had three or four failed runs. The game even gets easier as you play it, as many of the unlockable abilities are outright better than the pool you start out with. Most bosses are pretty simple, requiring a minimum effort to dodge and succesfully damage. None of them require specific abilities to defeat, either, meaning \"spam bullets until it dies\" is the strategy for all of them.\n\nA Robot Named Fight is not a good Metroid clone, it's not a good roguelite, and it doesn't bring anything new or unique to the table. Given the large library of Metroid clones availabe for the PC, currently or in the near future, this game is not worth picking up.

I wanted to like this, I really, really gave this game a solid try, but the randomness of it tied into its bad game design and finally, horrible difficulty spikes made me walk away.\n\nA Named Fight has you as a lone robotic hero standing against an invasion of meat monsters on your robot world. The plot seemed pretty interesting at the beginning, but it never seemed to be fleshed out. This has the makings of a great game but it never managed to even be a good game. A Robot Named Fight is a painfully disappointing experience that left me wanting to pull out my old copy of Super Metroid.\n\nThe character design, movement and even a few of the weapons are Metroid like. The rest of the game\u2026 ugh.. the rest of the game is a randomized shit show. Some runs you will find yourself getting almost no power-ups and then walking into a boss fight that you are in no way prepared for.\n\nNow, I don\u2019t mean you just randomly walk into the room. I mean that the game steers you into said boss fight encounter because you have no other places to go. There might not just be any other paths or the paths that are available are blocked, needing power-ups you haven\u2019t received yet to pass them. This happened several times for me and it was always maddeningly frustrating. Especially after spending 10-20 minutes to find the boss. I would inevitably die and it wasn\u2019t fun, it wasn\u2019t a learning experience, it was just cheap and frustrating.\n\nThe boss fights themselves are just horribly implemented and done. Many enemies have hard to see tells if any at all before unleashing powerful and often times one shot kill attacks. That is just wrong. Others create so many smaller enemies that the screen is practically filled with them all moving around making dodging an impossibility.  Others, are just pushovers\u2026 Getting this random grab bag of bosses with no rhyme, reason or regard to player progression is just bad game design and game-breaking as a player.\n\nRoguelike games are supposed to test player skill in the face of adversity. Good ones raise the difficulty appropriately the further you make it. Each death is clean and there is always something to learn about how you died. The biggest problem is, the games dependency on the player getting useful weapons, health power-ups and other useful items. A Robot Named Fight isn\u2019t beatable without them, but they often times don\u2019t every show up.\n\nThe character control isn\u2019t tight enough. The plot had potential, but fizzled out. The randomization is broken. Buying items in the hidden shops is a horrible experience thanks to the total lack of explanation of what you are buying and what it\u2019s for.  Not to mention the near impossibility of getting the needed currencies to buy things. etc\u2026etc\u2026etc\u2026. There is a lot more wrong with this game but at this point, I feel like I am beating a dead horse.\n\nA Robot Named Fight has the makings of a great game, but as is, I hate it. I can\u2019t honestly see this mess getting any better. Maybe, maybe if the developer turned this into a proper linear platformer instead of a randomized game this would be a better experience, sadly I doubt that is going to happen.\n\nhttp://nardio.net/2017/10/10/robot-named-fight-review/\n", "timestamp_created": 1507652939, "timestamp_updated": 1507652939, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.433534", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35560684": {"recommendationid": "35560684", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065860631", "num_games_owned": 218, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 191, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507429945}, "language": "english", "review": "A lovingly crafted hybrid of Super Metroid and Dark Void, it takes the visual themes and atmosphere of Dark Void, and the gameplay of Super Metroid.

The difference between this game, and other Metroid \"clones\" is that this game has much more replay value, due to the fact that it is randomly generated every time you start a new game, in a way much similar to Issac or Gungeon.

The game also has multiple versions of the same upgrades, some that take ammo and some that are primary weapon upgrades.  This makes each playthrough feel more varied and fresh, giving you different variations of the same basic weaponry and equipment.  Arachnomorph takes the place of the Morph Ball in Metroid, but on another playthrough you may get the \"Power Slide\" ability instead, which allows you to slide under small passage ways in a similar fashion.  This game feels incredibley polished and nice.  It's a great experience, and it blends sections of it's random level so well, I wouldn't know it was randomly generated the first time I played if I hadn't read about the game before I purchased it.  The smooth visual transition is particularly impressive, and the different areas are unique and interesting to look at.  It's a very good game, and my only complaints are the lack or more than one real song on its soundtrack (Which is almost like a remix of the Brinstar theme from Super Metroid) and the lack of variety in boss battles.  The Boss battles are fun, but not very difficult.  Having bosses themselves being randomly generated from different boss \"parts\" would be interesting, or at least giving them weak spots.  As of right now all the bosses are just bullet sponges, and adding weak spots would spice things up.  Randomly generated bosses would be amazing, but difficult to do, making it's lack of implementation understandable, but the bosses still need more variety and unique gimmicks for them.  There is particularly few bosses as well, making the lack of uniqueness particularly unforgivable.  These issues are very small, however, when compared to the overall quality of the game.  Very good, very worth your time and money.\n\n85/100 Score - Must play for fans of the Metroidvania genre, esecially those looking for a high replay value experience.", "timestamp_created": 1507430980, "timestamp_updated": 1507430980, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491172", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35496803": {"recommendationid": "35496803", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049806292", "num_games_owned": 175, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 18, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507214513}, "language": "english", "review": "Have yet to spend much time with it due to time constraints, but thus far it looks like a very polished metroid-esque game.

I try to judge a game on its own qualities, but it\u2019s impossible not to notice the similarities. Fight feels and plays exactly like Samus in Super Metroid. You spin like Samus when you jump forward, you aim up and down like Samus, you crouch like Samus. This isn\u2019t a bad thing because Samus felt great in Super Metroid, and Fight feels great here. However, problems arise when the game seeks to not only emulate the feel but the structure as well of games like Super Metroid.\n\nTo the game\u2019s credit, it does generate a properly built interconnected world. It is, by the end of a run, a complete Metroid map. Sure, each room is of a pre-built format, but it serves the form for this game. The premise is that you, a lone robot on a planet of robots, must fight the \u201cmeat.\u201d Enemies are dynamically designed, if a bit ugly to look at, and the combat is snappy. All enemies look like big flappy flesh monsters, with a few exceptions. You\u2019ll come across an area boss occasionally, all of which are fun to fight. I do like how the game handles \u201csaves\u201d. A save station functions basically as an extra life. If you die, you\u2019ll respawn back at the save station. This is a smart way to give the player a second chance, especially in the context of a game with a lot of space to cover.\n\nBeing designed like a Metroid game, the world map becomes large and sprawling. Runs can be too long and lost too quickly to feel satisfying. You can be in a run for well over half an hour and not be too far in before it\u2019s all over in an instant. Sure, that\u2019s the idea of a rogue-like, but runs more often than not felt like sunk time. Occasionally, you\u2019ll unlock a new permanent upgrade. Dying always feels super disappointing, because you know you\u2019re going to have to do the same things every time: find a gate, get one of a few upgrades, use on said gate, fight a boss, drop into a new area, etc. This is a caveat from the random generation. Upgrades are consistently the same for the sections, so it becomes repetitive and unexciting. You always collect the same subset of weapons and upgrades in the first section: missiles, charge beam, flamethrower, etc. It felt like I was just playing the same game over and over again, but without a normal save slot.\n\nIf the appeal of a rogue-like is often adapting and learning what\u2019s coming next, the game becomes too rote to succeed at this. If the appeal of a rogue-like is often replayability, the game is too predictable to succeed at this. If the appeal of a Metroidvania is often slowly building a strong character over a campaign, the upgrades feel too inconsequential to succeed at this. If the appeal of a Metroidvania is exploring a fascinating alien world, the game\u2019s maps are too predictable to succeed at this. The structure of Metroidvania becomes frustrating within the context of a roguelike. Backtracking becomes tiring and annoying (especially with the bland soundtrack droning on) because you might end up wasting your time anyway if you die soon enough. All rooms in the game are of a stock subset, and certain tiles have the chance of being a hidden upgrade, so when I walked into a room that was marked on the map, I knew exactly which blocks to shoot. The novelty of discovery is lost.\n\nIt\u2019s weird because ultimately I think A Robot Named FIGHT! is a fine game. The game plays well; it\u2019s put together fine. But every time I played a run, it just felt like a bland Metroid. Yes, the game has succeeded at emulating the Metroidvania structure of an interconnected world within the confines of a rogue-like, but it fails to realize that the structure of those games was only a fraction of what made them so good. When these maps have only the cold generation of a computer, they lack flavor and heart. It\u2019s a Metroid game in shape, but something was lost in its spirit.\n\n---\n\nThis review was written in tandem with [url=http://saveorquit.com] Save or Quit.

I'm not pretending to speak from an objective viewpoint, here. I either liked the game, or I didn't.\n\nA decent little procedurally-generated rougelike Metroidvania. Plays very similar to - and looks a lot like - Super Metroid, which was the entire reason I bought it and it did not let me down in that regard. \n\n[h1]A quick breakdown of what I did, and did not, like about the game:[/h1]\n\n[b]Things I Liked:[/b][list]\n[*]Handles close to Super Metroid, and has a similar gameplay style.\n[*]Good pixel art, and great effects.\n[*]Lots of upgrades to acquire.\n[*]Great enemy design (visual and practical) for the most part.\n[*]Story was orginal in many aspects.\n[/list]\n[b]Things I Was Neutral Towards:[/b][list]\n[*]Story overall, however, was rather meh. Which is its own charm for some people.\n[*]Soundtrack isn't great or varied, but at least suits the game.\n[*]Jumping feels like it's always underwater, which is weird.\n[*]Lots of unlockables, which is great if you're into that.\n[*]Most areas are pretty cramped.\n[/list]\n[b]Things I Did Not Like:[/b][list]\n[*]Locked out of several runs because the game does not spawn approproate power ups in an attainable area.\n[*]Not very many procedural rooms - feels very same-y each run.\n[*]Lots of randomization in the powerups, meaning some are wasted; i.e. getting lots of \"Energy Tanks\" for secondary weapon, when I don't get one until the end of the run.\n[*]Very little explanation about some powerups. I thought the Shield Bot would protect me. Turns out, it doesn't, not much anyway.\n[*]Dark rooms are unnecessarily annoying. Doesn't add to gameplay aside from making me find one more powerup that may or may not be there.\n[*]Speed Module. I don't want to run faster, Fight is plenty fast. How about my bullets go faster instead?\n[*]Fragile Shell. I lose health for speed and RoF? Makes Fight almost uncontrollable. Lame.\n[*]UI gets in the way of... well, everything. Including itself (active save station icon is overlayed on minimap).\n[*]Doesn't scale well on 21:9 (3440x1440) monitors. Understandable because it's a minority resolution? Yes. Doesn't mean I liked it.\n[/list]\n[b]Things I Would Change: [/b][list]\n[*]Have some kind of \"completable\" check so I'm not missing powerups to progress, even after I've checked every room.\n[*]Get rid of Scrap counter on main UI and move it to the fullsize map display.\n[*]Fullsize map display is toggable, not hold to use.\n[*]Turn on and off powerups. E.g. Not a fan of Big Bolt, but I want my 100% item find.\n[*]Boss name display, rather than just \"Get Ready\". I know it's a boss fight, I've played a videogame before.\n[*]Jumping mechanics. It's too... floaty. Like I said, it feels like it's underwater.\n[*]More distinct areas.\n[*]RT + LT is always aiming straight up, regardless of movement.\n[*]Map size modifier. Like, Normal, Double, Quadruble for number of rooms.\n[*]Powerup exchange vendor. Trade one powerup for another one like it. E.g. firebolt for flamethrower, slide for spiderbot form and vice versa.\n[/list]\n\nBiased About:\nSome animations could use work, or a few more frames. Jump + shoot down in particular is kinda cringy. But I've also got a hard-on for how Super Metroid it looks, so I'm probably just unconsciously expecting that animation.\n\n[h1]Overall Impression:[/h1]\nIt's not a BAD game, don't get me wrong. Could it stand improvement? Sure. Most games could, so it's not like it's alone there. It's easy to pick up and play, it's stable, and it's fun in and of itself.

Or at least, that's what the game's first impressions seem to imply.\n\nRather than expecting you to learn every room and every enemy flawlessly, punishing every mistake and holding health drops and ammunition to ransom, ARNF embraces its obvious inspiration. Health and energy drop regularly and in ample supply, enemies respawn between rooms, and the overall gameplay balance seems to be made to facilitate fun encounters and exploration rather than focusing on lots of short-lived runs.\n\nPerhaps it's just my first impressions, but it seems to me like ARNF is more interested in giving you something fun and well polished to play that can be replayed over and over with different results, rather than making the roguelike elements a restraint that draws all the focus. I almost expect the roguelike elements were added in simply because they had too many ideas they wanted to add to fit a standard game, and so used procedural generation to shuffle elements between playthroughs.\n\nOn my very first run, I got 3 zones in.

this is a yes. It's worth every penny and then some. \nAn excellent game, somehow made by one guy.\n\nARNF plays, feels, looks and sounds like an indie version of Metroid. In the best ways. \nAlbeit with a Robots Vs. Meat Monsters theme.\nIts controls are tight and the level design is solid. \nGood enemy variety as well, especially within the limitations of \"meat monsters\".\n\nOn one side, it's a roguelite. On the other side, each run is basically an independent Metroidvania game. \nWith each run taking between 50-70 minutes if you aren't rushing too much.\n\nYou start, fight your way to the first boss, then drop down into the exploration part of the game, it's fairly open but usually a loop that you can figure out vaguely where things are going to be. This makes \"speedrunning\" possible while still being randomly generated.\nThere are incentives to revisiting areas that you couldn't fully explore (like a proper metroidvania), there are merchants where you can buy some very helpful or powerful items and upgrades.\nLittle white circles on the map denote the general location of items (often hidden in the walls, floors or ceilings), it's entirely possible to 100% collect each item every run.\nThis is all good stuff that I'd expect from a pure metroidvania.\n\nOn the roguelite side, it does have permadeath and a generated map, different bosses are selected each run, different items and *key items. \nAs well as unlocks that affect future runs; items you can find or buy and the ability to sometimes start with extra items.\n\n*Key items being a staple of Metroidvanias, such as an item to let you move under 1-block-tall spaces, or explosives to bust through an armored door that you saw 20 minutes ago\n\nYou can even unlock one-shot save stations, up to 3 extra lives can generate on the map once you unlock this feature. Sometimes you won't even need them because, unlike a lot of other roguelites, this game isn't brutally hard.\nFor the most part, it's fair when you get hit.

The story is woefully underdeveloped by comparison, but that's not terribly important because that's not what the game is about, it's just a little disappoint because it seems like it could be deeper due to the areas you visit. The controls are floaty but fairly easy to get used to, especially for a Metroid veteran. The enemies are all very gross and organic, and they seem interestingly parasitic--a lot of later enemies in the game are visibly combinations of previous enemies in ways that gives them unique abilities, which is very cool and feeds into the aesthetic. However, the biggest surprise was how good the procedural dungeon generation is. The overall layout is somewhat sporadic and doesn't feel as hand-crafted as a Metroid map, but the individual rooms are solid, and the enemy placement feels like what you'd see in a Metroid game; they even move around a bit after defeating a boss, and in true Metroid style, some areas will change quite a bit if you live long enough to revisit them.\n\nThe biggest problem with this game at the time of this review are the bugs. Occasionally, the camera sticks in place when it should be moving around a room with the character. This can usually be fixed by saving and reloading. Aiming doesn't seem quite as snappy as it should, either, as holding up actually causes the character to aim diagonally upward for a moment before aiming straight up. Sometimes projectiles will float in the direction you aimed for a moment and then drift off in a different direction, too. Some specific weapons seem to be far more succeptable to this behavior than others, namely the flamethrower. That all said, none of this stuff is utterly gamebreaking and it didn't really hurt my experience beyond the initial confusion.\n\nThe only actual gripes I have for this game are that it's so short and easy. I'm not terribly good at Metroid. In fact, Fusion is the only 2D Metroid I've ever completed. But I beat this on my second playthrough, and the only reason I died in the first one was because a door transition walked me out into some spikes at a bad time. You see, most of the bosses in this game are just a bit beefier than normal enemies. You can smoke them pretty fast just by constantly shooting them--most of them don't have gimmicky methods of hurting them like Metroid bosses do. In fact, the first boss I fought became a regular enemy near the end of the game, albeit in an optional gauntlet that lead to some upgrades. These complaints don't extend to the final boss, which is frantic and difficult for reasons I won't get into. Experience it for yourself.\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend this little gem. It's not long and it's not terribly difficult unless you roll a rough dungeon, but it has very high replayability factor. If you ever finished a Metroid game and said, \"That was fun, but I sure wish I could just have more of that.\" Well, now you can have more fresh Metroid experiences. Repeatedly. For a mere ten dollars. If this game is on sale and you don't already own it, there's absolutely no reason you shouldn't buy it immediately.", "timestamp_created": 1505604253, "timestamp_updated": 1505604253, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34998549": {"recommendationid": "34998549", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081199744", "num_games_owned": 371, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 131, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510800464}, "language": "english", "review": "A very unforgiving Metroidvania style game.

Over all a great game. \n\nIf the whole GORE thing turns you away from the trailers, its not really that bad, and honestly if the dev asked me how to change their trailer I would say focus on what you do interesting rather than the whole GORE thing. \n\nMade by a single guy for the most part. \n\nUsing examples of other games, this game is literally a Metroid / Binding of isaac like game. \n\nEvery run you do is some what random, bosses, actual room lay outs, direction you need to go. But the metroid aspect comes from actually gaining items that enhance you. Things like double jump, charge beam. Which not only give you more freedom or strength, they also open up their own paths opening more of the game. \n\nA great example of this is the sub weapon system, you have a small energy pool (recharges on its own slowly) Which allows you to use things like Lightning Rod which pierces walls, locks on to enemies, AND does the same affect that a charge beam would on doors. So while your run may NEVER come across Charge Beam you'll have that Lightning Rod gun to open doors, and paths.\n\nUnlocks work a lot like Binding of Isaac, which is fine. The majority of items are always good.

The story is not the main focus, and thank god its not, because its just about killing some giant flying meatball.\n\nAs soon as you start the game, you immediately go into the settings and fix your button layout. I don't have a 360 contoller, and I don't know why, but my Generic USB Joystick (my GameCube controller) has an inverted axis only on this game, and I can't seem to fix it. So I had to use keyboard, which was probably the best option for me. The most suitable way I found is to have movement with 'WASD', diagonal aiming and switching weapons on the arrow keys, Space to shoot and Enter to jump.\n\nThe game doesn't hold your hand, and unless you know how Super Metroid controls, you may go through a few playthroughs getting confused about the control scheme.\n\nUpon choosing 'New Game' the world is created, building a map using pre-existing rooms with random powerups in them.\n\nEven if you only get terrain-phasing shots, four orbs, and no energy weapons, or something equally ridiculous, the game is still entirely completable as its procedurally generated to construct the world's obstacles based on the upgrades you are given. Because of this, the game is fairly linear, and you should be able to get 100% completion as long as you go through every room, since there's no secret rooms or alternate shortcuts, and all the items show up on your map.\n\nEventually you'll come to your first boss, 1 out of 3 random bosses for each area. Although these bosses are simple enough, they can be quite hard especially at the start since you're only guaranteed one or two powerups, which may not even be for your weapon.\n\nIf you beat the boss, you'll be introduced to the game's semi-permadeath mechanic, with new items and perks for all future playthroughs as you progress and unlock achievements. \n\nThese items can be found in upgrade rooms, or forged by the hand of allies whom you can find in the lower levels of the world. To craft these items, you use scrap found from monsters, or found randomly in hidden locations where powerups can also spawn. You don't need to craft these for 100% completion, but you do need to find all the ones across the world.\n\nIf you manage to survive the onslaught of all four areas and their respective bosses, the objective now is to go all the way back to the start and kill Megabeast. Assuming you beat the damage sponge that is the final boss, you teach robotkind the important lesson that things die when you kill them.\n\nThe ending wraps up telling you Megabeast's arrival was due to the 'anti-fascist' Mole People, and that many other robots will now take on the name Fight and challenge Megabeast. Which kind of makes sense with the permadeath idea. S'not 'A Robot Named Fight' as much as it is 'Multiple Robots Named Fight'. \nAnd the game ends with no further explanation. And then you win!

I read reviews and kind of saw how they explained a little bit of the programming made to make a consistent roguelike metroidvania, but it didn't take the wonder away. I like the choices given and I like that there are more upgrades than necessary. It makes playthroughs all the more interesting when you have a different combination of abilities each time.  I genuinely think it brings a better sense of satisfaction finding upgrades in this game than in Metroid games. The tiny ability upgrades makes you feel like Fight gets stronger and stronger, rather than just plateauing and gaining a new ability.  Felt like an RPG element in a metroidvania I didn't know I wanted until now.\n\nIt wears it's inspiration on its sleeve, definitely. The hallways feel sometimes almost copy and pasted from Super Metroid (one time I found a secret in the exact same place as in SM). I get that Binding of Isaac is a revered game, but the art style is personally off putting. Thankfully the gameplay here is good enough to stomach the art direction inspired (at least partly) by that. \n\nThe game seems a bit like the difficulty swings from thrive or die, what I mean by that is I never have a problem with my health or with my energy... until I do. The challenges here are big, but in a game that takes on the metroidvania and roguelike challenges at the same time, the feeling of peril doesn't really get you until you hit an unescapable boss room. I feel like this may be a tough obstacle to hurdle in a procedurally generated game, but the juxtaposition between run and gun, moderate invincibility in exploration zones and then crushed like an origami crane during some of the harder boss battles is just frustrating. You forget what you're getting into.\n\nIf I could fix any things about the game though? I'd have a more easy to control aiming system, putting aiming as an option on the right analog stick seems like a no brainer. I'd fix hit boxes and collision detection, I can't tell you how many times I have wasted time just trying to jump up a one box hole when Fight's sprite looks slender enough to fit. And lastly, I'd at least include a settings option to turn off the flashing lights in a certain section of the map. It doesn't really feel like they add anything, but they are a strain on my eyes and I'd worry for someone who has a more sensitive reaction than me.\n\nAll in all its a pretty great game and I can't wait to keep playing it and finding all the things the world has to offer.", "timestamp_created": 1505229290, "timestamp_updated": 1505230450, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34902373": {"recommendationid": "34902373", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078153982", "num_games_owned": 97, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 468, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511015953}, "language": "english", "review": "A Robot Named Fight is an easy 10/10.

You can tell this game is a love letter to the genre, and it scratches just about every itch that's associated with it.\n\nI'm not fantastic at reviewing so I'll just skip right to the Pros and Cons:\n\nPros:\n- It's a bite-size adventure that has all of the best elements of a Metroid game. It's designed to be able to be beaten in a little over an hour, which encourages multiplie playthroughs and speed running.\n- There's a good sense of progression, you really feel like an unstoppable force by the end of a run, yet the final boss remains challenging.\n- No mindless wandering. I know this wont be a plus for everyone, but I don't like feeling entierly at a loss on what to do next, this game always has a few leads to follow if you're unsure. It never spells it out for you, but you always have an idea on where to go next.\n- It follows the beam-stacking formula, which means your default weapon will always be fun to upgrade and worth using.\n- There are some really nice musical pieces in here.\n\nMixed Impressions:\n- Bosses are a bit too easy sometimes. I'm grateful for this sometimes, but other times I'm unsure. Maybe the late game bosses could be a little harder. The final boss seems just right though.\n- The minimap lets your know if there's a powerup in the room somewhere. This isn't a big deal, and encourages speedier play, but I wouldn't mind if there were additional powerups that weren't revealed on the map as well as the ones that are. (Unless there are, then whoa...)\n- The downward shot while jumping looks hillarious. \n- No wall jump. I can see how this would break a procedurally generated game though.\n\nCons:\n- This is just an early game gripe, but my first few play throughs saw too many of the same powerups.\n- Each run (so far.) has contained the same areas in the same locational placement. \n\n\nI'm always happy to see fellow Unity developers have success.

Lord knows this game has done more for the Metroid series in about 2.5 hours of my life than Nintendo has in the past what, 4 years?\n\nPROS:\n- Unlocking items for future playthroughs is always a nice time, making your next runs feel that much more fresh.\n- Secrets aren't too hard to hunt down, which for this style of game IS a good thing.\n- Bosses are varied between playthroughs so its neat when you fight one you haven't before.\n- The game controls and feels just like Super Metroid.\n- While its true that coming across the same rooms is kind of yawn inducing, its nice that the larger rooms have varied doorways between runs.\n- Poor, poor Tutorial Smith. We knew him long enough.\n- Save Rooms as extra lives was brilliant.\n\nCONS:\n- The music just.. isn't that good. Its not BAD by any means, but I often found it really easy to just ignore and never really felt like it was adding to the experience.\n- Its... shorter than I'd like. My first successful run was about 2 hours long and after I beat the boss I just sat there wondering if there was gonna be anymore. Then the credits rolled.\n- The Final Boss fight could have been better. Its a nice bullet hell (sort of) but when you show up completely decked out you can kinda just blast all the pesky mobs and bullets.\n- Normally I like my games Charge-Attacks to charge off the first press, but in this case I found it more frustrating that my attack-speed gets nerfed slightly by having a charge weapon because it always tries to charge shots when I wanna just tap-tap-tap the fire button quickly. (This might be modifiable in the options, so if it is disregard this and call me an idiot)\n\nThings that could be done to improve the experience (aka Things that my greedy white ass demands of the dev) :\n- Make it so that you can visit the Final Boss at any point, this will promote Speed Runs and No-Powerup Runs. And give the Final Boss door a clear warning so that people know to avoid it if they want to.\n- Unlockable areas to flesh-out (heh) future playthroughs, Isaac did it first yeah but that doesn't mean its a bad mechanic for other Roguelikes.\n\nThats all I've really got right now.

I like it a lot. In fact I was giddy when I first started playing it because it blew my expectations out of the water. I've beaten the game twice now, and from what I understand after you've beaten it a few times, the game gets harder, which is good.\n\nPros:\n[list]\n[*]Real metroidy map design and gameplay loop\n[*]Different upgrades spawn that help you get through the same obstacle. For example, to reach a high ledge some games will give you a double jump, some games will give you a jetpack, ect.\n[*]More items unlock when you complete certain achievements.\n[*]The character movement feels almost exactly like super metroid, which is admittedly kind of sluggish. This is a pro for nostalgia, and a con for feeling sluggish, ha.\n[*]Lots of bosses and lots of content. Each run has you fight 5 bosses including the main boss, but there is a lot more bosses than that in the pool that can be drawn from.\n[*]Local coop is as good as it can be for a metroid like game. The second player controls a floating orb and basically plays like a twin stick shooter. Having the second player makes the game a lot easier, but that's okay.\n[*]Interesting art, and unique locations to explore.\n[/list]\n\nCons:\n[list]\n[*]The opening sequence is poorly voice acted. I wish that there wasn't a voice actor and that it was just text.\n[*]There's a piece of graffiti in one of the areas that says \"f***\". Everything else in the game is probably rated E10+, and that automatically makes it so you can't play with your kids anymore for absolutely no benefit. Kind of ridiculous.\n[*]The video options are pretty limited.\n[*]Finding the upgrades secretly hidden in the walls is kind of a chore. There is no graphical indication (that I saw) where the upgrade is, so you just have to shoot like a crazy person all over the room until you break the wall chunk that has the upgrade in it.\n[*]Sometimes enemies are a little hard to see against the environment.\n[/list]", "timestamp_created": 1505074136, "timestamp_updated": 1505074221, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500086", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34869750": {"recommendationid": "34869750", "author": {"steamid": "76561198096607404", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2173, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506864631}, "language": "english", "review": "If you liked Binding of Isaac and Super Metroid, then you will LOVE this game.

This year has been amazing for \"homage\" games with 20XX taking inspiration from MegaMan X and now A Robot Named Fight! from metroid (a series in dire need of SOMETHING) \n\nYou play as a Robot attempting to rid the world of fleshy beasts and if your robot dies, another Robot takes its place (not a huge deal, but it helps me personally be okay with the lore aspect of the revive lol)\n\nThere are hidden powerups throughout the map and there are indicators on the map telling you that there's a powerup in the room...this is a pro and a con. I can see people being a little MEH about KNOWING there's a powerup in the room because then there's no \"discovery\" but you still have to search for the powerup. Maybe in the future there can be an option to turn off the indicators?\n\nThe gameplay is great, it feels like you're in a Metroid game. The weapons and powerup you get change so much about the game. You can only access certain areas with certain powerups and sometimes you flat out don't even see those powerups and will have to abandon that room. \n\nBasically - if you're a fan of metroid and \"roguelike\" permadeath games with random powerups you should buy this game. It's fantastic, It's so much fun.

It would have been nice to find some lore items that you can collect.\n\nSo unless the game gets longer as you beat it there isn't much replayability, once you beat it that's it. I look forward to what the dev does next, I feel that if he ever decides to make another metroidvania without the rogue-like elements and with some storytelling elements he can make a game as good or even better than Axiom Verge.\n\nSo, should you buy this game?\nIf you are here because of the Metroidvania or Pixelated graphics tags then yes, it's a wonderful addition to your collection.\nIf you are interested in the Rogue-like element you may consider waiting for a discount/more content being added.\n\nEdit: After playing the game a couple of more hours there's some things that I want to point out:\n- The game becomes harder with each playthrough which is good since it makes the replayability better.\n- Enemy placement should be rechecked in future patch notes to avoid \"unfair\" damage, specially on later playthroughs.\n(SPOILERS)\n- A new area becomes available after beating the game a sixth time which adds a bit of lore.

Exploration also comes into play with various hidden items and optional side-routes scattered around the map, and their placement even encourages backtracking to old areas to find new secrets with acquired abilities.

The creator managed to find the right balance of sprawling exploration, backtracking to areas previously not accessable, unlockable powerups, and just plain, good fun. Excellent original soundtrack and great meaty sounds. \n\nDropping into the game the first time immediately reminded me of Super Metroid; especially the movement. Although sluggish at first (at least compared to my memory of Super Metroid), the movement feels better after your first speed powerup and overall makes sense with the concept of continued growth. By time you head to the final area, you feel light-years from your sluggish start. \n\nYou'll spend slightly over an hour to collect everything and get to the final area. I'm sure that time comes down the more you play (there is a 35 minute acheivement). While, I was initial surprised how quickly it took me, it does feel right. Replaying the game yields new bosses to fight and new powerups to enjoy. There are also varied room types each play through, such as fire rooms and dark rooms. Good surprises each run. \n\nFor me, the difficulty is somewhat easy with moments of panic as Fight hangs on with 1 bar of health. I think the difficulty could be bumped up or possibly offer a hard option to suit people's taste. Don't get me wrong, a wreckless person will be punished. \n\nA Robot Named Fight! is well worth the asking price, especially given the creator is actively incorporating feedback into the game.

I wanna leave a positive review but I just can't for the game's cost/length.\n\nThere's a lot of good - the music and sound are pretty solid, the graphic style is decently solid. They've got a nice pixely art thing going, but obviously not a 'true' pixel art with the way assets and gibs move and flop around, but it's a minor nag.\n\nWhat gets me  though is I beat the game, first playthrough, no deaths, in an hour and fourteen minutes. The bigger problem is I didn't really feel compelled to do it again - the unlocks just seemed to be a few random powerups and a weapon or two, but none of that really changes up the game dynamic enough to be really worth further exploration. Metroidvanias work because they are sprawling and vast - this one had basically two areas, and that's it. Several powerups felt kinda pointless - the 'dash' is just a sluggish short-range dash with no purpose besides breaking a few blocks to arbitrarily block you, and many many assets are more 'copied' than 'inspired by' metroid. There's a fine line between homage and needless mimicry. The last boss was more of a pain in the finger from button mashing than difficulty, I knelt in one spot and just shot for a few minutes.\n\nThis is a game where I wish steam had a yes but bear in mind or a more neurtal rating, I hate having to give it a thumbs down, but I really just wouldn't recommend someone to buy it. It just doesn't quite work as it is. A true metroidvania relies on several things to really make it jive, and those things don't really jive well with some roguelike nuances.\n\nIt was kinda fun but horrifically short - if I hadn't left it on the title screen to get lunch I woulda beat it with 45 minutes to spare in the refund window, and that just doesn't cut it for me and a 'metroidvania' of any sort. The entire point is to spend hours and hours wandering  and exploring different areas, going back and forth, finding things, etc.\n\nSeveral things really threw off this game further - the item which lets you see powerups totally trivializes exploration and removes the need to keep an eye out, you immediately know every room with a powerup, period. SEveral powerups don't seem to work together - I got a 'shot fragments on collision' powerup, but my shots already passed through enemies and walls.. so it just did nothing? The shops have no explanation whatsoever for items until after you buy them, and resources to purchase seem random/scarce.. but ultimately not really needed anyways, apparently.\n\nThe game isn't bad, if it were just a couple bucks I'd let it slide for an hour and change, but as it is I just don't think it really works.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1504821283, "timestamp_updated": 1504821283, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 67, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.661966", "comment_count": "19", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34803231": {"recommendationid": "34803231", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045040005", "num_games_owned": 183, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 462, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512599665}, "language": "english", "review": "You know?

This is your game. \nNow I know what you guys are thinking: a roguelike with procedural generated maps? Sounds dull. HELL FUCKING NO.  Trust me: every single time you start, the map layout arranges itself, and every single fucking time it's something that it isn't crazy nor it doesn't feel dull. Heck, you can even get shortcuts in order to reach other areas faster. And everything connects perfectly which is something that you'll never see in any other \"metroidvania roguelike\".

Coming from someone who played Super Metroid for more than 200 hours it's something.\nPros:\n+Great level design \n+Great soundtrack\n+Controls are just great\n+Exploration feels and IS rewarding\n+Random generated maps which connect areas in a very metroidesque way\nCons:\n-It ends.

Not only does this game play and feel just like Super Metroid and have all the great ideals that game held true, but it has the uniqueness of it's roguelite gameplay loop to hold it firm in place. Not often are games so easily pinned against one another, but as far as I'm concerned this is a true roguelite metroidvania (as expressed in the email I recieved). Now for the fun bits:\n\nGameplay - When someone think of Super Metroid, they most likely think of the large map that folds in on itself via item-gated challenges. Well A Robot Named Fight does just this. Every run (we'll get to that in a bit) of the game has a clearly defined meta progression to follow in order to win. Items unlock new areas you couldn't access before and lead to more fun challenges and items. Now when someone mentions The Binding of Isaac, or roguelites in general, they think of persistent progression, permadeath, and a run based gameplay loop. Well...how does one do that in a closed off exploraion based platformer? Matt figured it out, and I have no idea how. This game is run based like it's contemporaries, however each run is in it's own metroidvania style map. Sounds crazy right? Well you have to play it to believe it!\n\nSound - The games OST instantly grappled me with it's opening menu theme. The sound is reminiscent of old school Genesis and SNES titles. Not only is the music fantastic, but the games sound design is spot on as well. Footsteps, shots, squishes of meaty baddies, and all other assorted metal clinkings are right there to pull you into the environment.\n\nVisuals - This is the most subjective area of the review, and thusly is something best looked at via videos or screenshots. I find the art style of the game to be one of it's highlights. The art style pays great hommage to Super Metroid and the older Castlevania's. While most modern metroidvania games try to go above and beyond, sometimes a good classic feel is what's really needed. The art fits the game and while some may find it moderately offputting, I find it to be a right fit.\n\nMatt Bitner really did create one of this years greatest surprises for sure. This game came out of nowhere and will most likely end up in many of my followers steam libraries after release. A respectable price point for one of the most enjoyable games I've played this year.

As a big lover of Super Metroid and the almost 16-bit action adventure exploration perfection it brought to the table all of those years ago being a bastion of non-linarity and mechanics driving gameplay, I have long awaited something that would scratch that itch in the same way.\n\nA Robot Named Fight is right now the closest you will get to a true procedurally generated Super Metroid. The way the game carefully gives out its powers, to the sense of progression it manages to build up on each and every run. This is a very skill based game, and despite what some would think of the floaty controls at first, there is always a way to get out of binds and save yourself. Each death that comes feels well deserved and helps you learn more about the game.\nThe roguelite aspects of this game actually help it shine rather than confuse as some would think with a different map and item progression with every death or victory. Every run never outstays its welcome with a nice hour to hour and a half run time (provided the game doesn\u2019t kill you first), and if/when you die you don\u2019t ever feel too much loss since another run is just a click away.\n\nI haven\u2019t had this \u201cjust one more run\u201d feeling since Binding of Issac won me over so many years ago. This game truly is the perfect melding of Issac + Super Metroid gameplay that I didn\u2019t know could possibly work so well, and yet it does!\n\nThe pixel art in the game is superb and while it recalls into memory games such as Splatterhouse with its fun yet grotesque enemy designs and Metroid area inspirations, the game still manages to feel original. The music as well doesn\u2019t disappoint with not only hitting such great atmospheric tones to set the lone exploration mood, but also blood pumping full out rock tracks to help you finish the fight, its a wonder that everything here was put together just by one guy alone. The quality shines through every entire bit of this meat filled project as well as the sheer love for the gaming classics of yesteryear that have helped inspire this work of genius to be made.\n\nWith the developer stating that much like Binding of Issac, he hopefully plans to add in a bunch of new content over time to the game which would keep me (and everyone else hopelessly already addicted to this ) coming back constantly to this title for many months/years to come! The price point is perfect and has already given me so much enjoyment in my short time already. Because of this, I wish this game the most possible success and implore anyone who happens to be intrigued at how a Super Metroid roguelite could/should be done to immediately pick this one up! \n\nP.S.

I've known Matt Bitner for a few years and he's a hard working guy who has a good grasp on what makes good video games.\n\nIf you're a fan of Super Metroid and Roguelikes in general you will enjoy this game a lot. The sprite graphics fit the feel of the game, and the music is absolutely killer. The controls are not quite as tight as I would prefer, but you get used to it. The gameplay is really well thought out though. Each run you feel like you are progressing a little further and unlocking more goodies for your next run. It is very enjoyable learning about the different enemy types and how to approach them with your current weapon load out.

Dead Cells is great, don't get me wrong, but it's not at all a metroidvania no matter how many people or how much the devs will claim it is.\n\nAll the metroidvania elements are here: gated progression, meaningful powerups with your weapons and movement, and bosses, fun exploration.  All the roguelite elements are here too: permadeath, randomly doled-out powerups that will change from run to run, unlocks based on your performance, procedurally generated maps.\n\nA Robot Named Fight (ARNF) draws a lot from Super Metroid and Megaman and ties it into a relatively small map with runs that can last a little over an hour.  Control-wise, it feels like the movement was heavily inspired by Super Metroid which might feel a tad floaty at first, but is tight and precise as you master it.  There's a lot of fun different item and weapon combinations that you'll experience over your different runs.  One run might have you with a super-powered automatic rocket launcher, another one might have you relying on your energy-powered secondary weapons like the bouncing sawblade to deal most of your damage.\n\nARNF is a trailblazer in the \"roguevania\" space and makes me excited that my two favorite subgenres were successfully combined.  There are still some sacrifices from each side that were required, such as the intricate world-building of a well-crafted metroidvania, but ARNF proves that the \"roguevania\" is real.  And fun.  And now that it exists, I'm hoping that it inspires many other game developers to try their hand at making one.\n\ntldr: It's great.\n\nIf you're interested in an in-depth analysis on the concept of a \"roguevania\" with direct comparisons between A Robot Named Fight and Dead Cells, check out my video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpceV7GD6fg", "timestamp_created": 1504803716, "timestamp_updated": 1504803870, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476325", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34798148": {"recommendationid": "34798148", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023893421", "num_games_owned": 1296, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 415, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505064970}, "language": "english", "review": "Video showing off start and endgame: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z92rmBATH2w\n\nA Robot Named Fight is a Rogue-Like that captures the essence of Super Metroid. You start out as a weak robot fighting a bunch of meat beasts; but as you traverse the map and gain more powers, you become a full on fighting force.\n\nThe controls and feel of the game is very Super Metroid, it is one of the developer's favorite games and they nail it. Each run is one big map that has connections to different areas and ability gated sections like a Metroid game. You're fighting your way around the map looking for abilities to get passed the gated areas as you search for the final ability which will allow you to reach the final boss. Which is a pretty epic fight.\n\nThere are other bosses you have to take on as you travel across the map, each looking quite horrific while being an interesting fight.\n\nThe variety of enemies and weapons keep the game interesting for many hours of play.  Complete runs for me have taken around an hour.\n\nAnother great feature is \"pick up and play\", you can leave the game and come back later and it'll be where you left off. More Rogue-Likes need to do this.\n\nThe visuals are good, especially if you're into body horror. The music is good as well; my favorite is the opening song.\n\nThe game is also priced pretty well. You can have 10s to 100s of hours with this game and it's only $10. Pretty good.\n\nI like it and I recommend it.\n", "timestamp_created": 1504802997, "timestamp_updated": 1504802997, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.398203", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}}}

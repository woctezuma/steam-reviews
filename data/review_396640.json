The main gameplay loop consists of entering the tower, climbing as high as you can get, dying from [b] your own [/b] mistakes, and starting again with whatever newfound knowledge and experience you have.\n\nWhat makes this work so well is how tangible your progress through the tower feels. At any point on your journey, you will find yourself in a completely different environment than the one from the one half an hour ago, giving the tower a layered feel as you make your way to the top, and a feeling of true accomplishment with every conquered area. This is accompanied by fantastic pixel art and amazing sound design, not to mention the beautiful soundtrack. \n\nThe gameplay is in a league of its own. The developers realize very well that less is more, and so the gameplay can be entirely captured in running, jumping, climbing, and throwing or using items. The controls serve this gameplay near perfectly, except for the rare instances where you have to interact with vines (vines are not your friends). A complaint I have seen often is that this game's controls make no sense, and I frankly have to question whether whoever says this gave themselves a chance to even learn how to use them.\n\nThe design of this game will never cheat you. Your enemies in the game are the environments of the tower and the creatures residing in them. Every single one of the hazards will kill you almost instantly, but their behaviour and rules are clearly telegraphed no matter what. Whenever you die, it's because [b] you [/b] made a mistake, and the game punished you accordingly.\n\nTo summarize, this is a beautiful, well designed and, most importantly, fun game which has lasted me almost 150 hours so far, and I have yet to finish even the core game as of writing this review. If you pick this game up, or are even slightly interested in it, I recommend checking out the game's [url=https://discord.gg/82TQnWy] discord server, [/url] a dedicated and active community of helpful TowerClimb players who are always up to the task of answering your questions about the game or just having a chat about whatever.\n\nEDIT 1: Spelling and grammar.", "timestamp_created": 1512080874, "timestamp_updated": 1512826165, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37962905": {"recommendationid": "37962905", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063298490", "num_games_owned": 76, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 10943, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 447, "last_played": 1513733320}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is extremely fun as well as challenging.

However, I would also say that this game isn't for everyone. This game's difficulty level is very high, and is pretty much exclusive towards a hardcore audience. Even on easy, you'll die a lot. Scrubs will get kicked in the teeth here.\n\nThe controls, once you get to learn them, are very fluid. The gameplay is great and the music is very reminiscient of super metroid. As you climb the tower, you have to carefully manage your resources, and sometimes even make quick decisions on the fly. This can be both a good and a bad thing. The good, being that it teaches you to \"git gud\" over time, and the bad, being that you can't pause the game and oftentimes leads you to your death because you cant react quick enough. \n\nOk....you can't pause. I know, I kind of got turned off by it too. But each floor is usually very quick, and after beating the level, that's where you're supposed to take your break.  I think the reason why the devs didnt really bother to implement a pause button was to help you improve, but I still think it causes setbacks too, especially when nature calls or you have to answer your telephone, etc. I imagine that having a pause button would actually help the game more than do harm, but that's my opinion.\n\nThe other two things I think would make this better would be to add a quick save function and achievements. Having a quick save would be extremely helpful with this game for those who have to leave and come back later. Achievements would also be a great addition too, as this is a very challenging game. To get you an idea of how challenging, there are people on steam who have played over 100 hours and still havent beaten it. So trust me when I say that if this game had achievements, it would give a player great accomplishment in getting them all.\n\nAll things considered, with its flaws, I would give the game an 8.5 out of 10. Without them, I can see the game going to a 9 at least. This a very solid platforming title that would give fans of the genre a lot to offer.

It may even be amazing. But it is FAR too hardcore to have a broad audience, and for that reason, I must give it a thumbs down. That's the basis for my review at the core, but it's not the only reason. I think you should only buy this game if you are the most dedicated of roguelike players with your own personal high mechanical skill cap and are a junkie for Dark Souls to infinity levels of punishment. If you're not, then there is no world where this game is for you. This is not an Enter the Gungeon, Binding of Isaac, Rogue Legacy, or Don't Starve. Buy it, test it, but don't be afraid to get a refund from Steam and don't let yourself feel like this game \"beat\" you. This game requires religious amounts of dedication to learning its ins and outs along with the most stringent of mechanical prowess to get satisfaction from what you put in. \n\nPROS\n\nI loved a lot about this game, and I think it does yield a decent return on effort put in (if you can make it that far). That all, however, is not the aim of my review. If you want positives about the game, I suggest looking at the positive reviews. It's got an overall positive rating for a reason. I think that's completely justified, but I can also assume that it doesn't have a very large owner base either. \n\nCONS\n\nWhat TowerClimb copiously offers in hardcore rogue-like platforming it falls short in virtually every other department.\n\n* The pixel art is extremely basic. We're talking like if the Atari took steroids, that's the level of art you're to expect from this game. It's hard to distinguish hazards amongst all the muddy sprites sometimes, and it's just generally not very pretty to look at. Now I know that's a preference thing, but let's be serious about how much the quality of art has evolved in games compared to what's being offered here. There's an option to \"depixelize\" the games which just turns everything into what appears to be blurry, borderless watercolors. Ironically, making it harder to distinguish the multitude of hazards in the game.\n\n* The controls, while seemingly tight, are not very intuitive and require some relatively strict mechanical input to operate in frequent high stress situations. There are a lot of instances where you have less than a second to react to several incoming hazards. They're nigh unnavigable when you have to use upwards of 3-5 inputs almost instantenously. On top of that, several of the buttons serve dual functions at the same time, further complicating these highly mechanical maneuvers. To put this in perspective with an Xbox controller, to hold any item in your hand, you HAVE to hold down the X button at all times if you want it to be held in your hands. If you DO let go of the X button, your character will hurl the item away from you. The X button incidentally also must be held down to run. Very similar to Super Mario's control scheme. Then, let's say you're holding a sword, you have to press and hold the A button to swing it (with a delay on the lower tier swords). The A button also controls your jumping. That's 4 inputs plus movement controlling 6 functions all while trying to navigate hazards in the environment. Then combine all of that with the fact that you can only hold one item in your hands at once and every item has different uses, you're having to do an intricate dance with your hands to operate within life or death situations that affect whether or not you have to completely start over. Unfortunatley, the way the controls are designed and how they interact with mechanics are entirely intentional, so readjusting them would require a lot of reworking of some of the game mechanics.\n\n* The music is unbearably repetitive. Especially when you'll be spending a good chunk of time going back through the same areas after you die and restart. Now the two big issues with this, 1) There are certain sound cues tied to dangers/events happening around you that fall under \"music\". Not the worst thing and infrequent, but definitely an issue. 2) There isn't an option to turn off the music in the game. That's pretty basic functionality in my opinion. The workaround is to change the name of the \"Music\" folder in the game's directory to something else, but I don't feel like I should ever be required to do something like that for something literally every game has. Normally, this wouldn't really be a problem, because it's a tendency of rogue-likes. How often can you listen to the same music while dying over and over and not find it repetitive? But without integrated functionality to mute it, it's worth noting.\n\n* Now this is a HUGE issue for me. I'm talking monumental. There is no way to pause or save the game. I understand it's a roguelike where death and restarting are inevitable, but the sheer length of the \"story\" makes the ability to save a necessity. Even pausing alone would be far better than not being able to at all. I had to leave my computer running with the game playing for 11 hours one night, so I could pick up where I left off in a run.\n\n* As for variety, there are a slew of different biomes and hazards/enemies over the course of the game's 50 or so floor run, but each biome is divided into three floors and you'll be rerunning those floors a lot. Now I've put 10 hours into the first 4 biomes alone and I can very confidently tell you that there is not much variety within them. You are always the same guy, albeit with a different name and outfit color. There is hardly any equipment variation. I must have picked up nearly a thousand crates and blast berries at this point. The rarest thing I've found is appropriately and plainly named Golden Greaves. The cool, rare items that do exist are extremely hard to obtain or have a very low chance of coming into play, and they're usually one use items. The same 3-5 enemies/hazards are present in each biome. (Outside of a few random chance environmental hazards. Which I assure you, you don't want to encounter.) There are no unlockables or persistence aspects of any form between runs. The only thing there is to unlock are harder challenges. Which is great if you didn't mind the rough pounding the game gave you the first time around.\n\n*SLIGHT SPOILER* there is a slight bit of persistence in the form of one checkpoint halfway through the story. *END SPOILER*\n\n\nOVERALL\n\nI respect the two brothers who made this game. They clearly have a passion for niche, hardcore gaming, but that doesn't mean they're infallible nor does it mean that their project is perfect. 5 years is a lot of time to pour into something you care about, and I know critcism is hard to stomach especially with the amount of thought I'm sure you've put into every aspect of the game. Working as a two man unit without all the resources of a bigger company or studio can leave you lacking in certain areas and that's fine.

Anyways, you can feel this game was made with love by the devs behind it, they've put a lot of work into it and it deserves way more attention than it has. Also, there's a DLC planned to be released, which, according to people on Discord, will fix some bugs, add a new chapter and also the so desired save option.\n\nThis is definitely one of the best platformers i've ever played in my life.

I've lost track of my death count....\n\nEver think platformers were too easy??  Think you are too hardcore for a platformer??  This game will open your eyes!  \n\nTowerclimb is a brutal platformer that will punish most small mistakes with death.  That ever present threat of immenant death makes the game really epic and enjoyable.  You can purchase revive potions from shopkeeps to help offset the 'one slip and dead' situation.  The controls are very responsive - and 99% of your deaths will be YOUR fault. (whether from lack of skill, stupid decisions, not using/rationing items properly, etc.)   The music is fantastic.  Each run will tend to have a unique feel that requires different platforming skills.  The game has VERY impressive level randomization - which adds to the replay value significantly.  I'd say its definitely worth buying/playing 100%  \n\nNotes - I've played only with an xbox controller and it plays great\n           -  I have a high tolerance for dying a lot and learning my way to victory.  If you're impatient or hate dying, this game is probably not for you, lol.\n      -Patience, Focus, strategy, intelligence, determination, raw skill, twitch reflexes.....all of these things will help you in this game and create a rewarding experience.

Un sc\u00e9nario simple et tr\u00e8s discret, mais c'est surtout l'univers et l'ambiance qui se distinguent :\nTowerclimb d\u00e9gage une atmosph\u00e8re extr\u00eamement particuli\u00e8re, charg\u00e9e de mythes, de myst\u00e8res et de m\u00e9lancolie.\nJe n'avais pas ressenti une ambiance aussi singuli\u00e8re depuis Zelda Majora's Mask ou les jeux de Fumito Ueda, qui poss\u00e8dent une \u00e2me, une personnalit\u00e9 tr\u00e8s forte.\nTowerclimb fait partie de ces jeux-l\u00e0.\n\n\n+ STYLE DE JEU +\nC'est un rogue-like platformer fa\u00e7on Spelunky, sauf qu'ici il s'agit de grimper au lieu de descendre...\nce qui est d'autant plus int\u00e9ressant, car l'ascension est difficile et la crainte de la chute est omnipr\u00e9sente.\nOn a un petit inventaire pour stocker et utiliser divers objets comme des armes, de l'\u00e9quipement facilitant l'escalade, \ndes potions permettant de sauter plus haut ou de cr\u00e9er une explosion, etc.\nOn parcourt des niveaux g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9s al\u00e9atoirement mais ayant un th\u00e8me fixe \u00e0 chaque fois.\nLe jeu est divis\u00e9 en deux chapitres distincts avec un checkpoint au milieu, bien utile pour s'entra\u00eener.\nLe second chapitre est excellent et bien plus cr\u00e9atif que le premier, qui reste plus classique mais tr\u00e8s r\u00e9ussi quand m\u00eame.\nIl y a deux boss obligatoires \u00e0 la fin de chaque chapitre, et le combat final, faites-moi confiance, est vraiment exceptionnel. \n\n\n+ GRAPHISMES +\nJ'\u00e9tais un peu dubitatif en regardant juste le trailer et les screens, mais une fois immerg\u00e9 dans le jeu manette en main, c'est bien diff\u00e9rent. Car dans Towerclimb, le visuel, le rythme du jeu, les musiques, l'ambiance, tous ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments communiquent ensemble pour cr\u00e9er une belle atmosph\u00e8re, coh\u00e9rente et surprenante. \nLes niveaux sont tr\u00e8s vari\u00e9s, avec m\u00eame certaines th\u00e9matiques que vous ne retrouverez dans aucun autre jeu de ce genre.\nLe style est r\u00e9tro mais ultra fluide, et il se distingue par une direction artistique chatoyante, tr\u00e8s personnelle et singuli\u00e8re. Le r\u00e9tro n'est clairement pas un cache mis\u00e8re ici. De plus, des FX de lumi\u00e8re \u00e9tonnants (et de bon go\u00fbt) viennent moderniser le visuel et dynamiser l'action en permanence.\n\n\n+ DIFFICULTE +\nTowerclimb, c'est l'esprit d'un jeu r\u00e9tro combin\u00e9 avec un gameplay nerveux, fluide et moderne.\nDifficile et d\u00e9courageant au d\u00e9but, on se met \u00e0 ma\u00eetriser et \u00e0 adorer le jeu avec la pratique.\nLe challenge est clairement compens\u00e9 par une r\u00e9elle courbe de progression hyper gratifiante.\nChaque obstacle semble insurmontable au d\u00e9but, mais avec le recul nous para\u00eetra bien plus simple \u00e0 aborder une fois arriv\u00e9 un peu plus loin. Ce challenge fait partie de la dur\u00e9e de vie du jeu : Comptez une vingtaine d'heures pour ma\u00eetriser le chapitre 1, \net le double pour ma\u00eetriser le chapitre 2, qui est d'autant plus dur que fun.\n\n\n+ GAMEPLAY +\nLe gameplay jongle entre des phases nerveuses d'action, d'esquive et de plateforme pr\u00e9cise, \net des temps morts plut\u00f4t reposants lorsqu'on est occup\u00e9 \u00e0 grimper.\nPass\u00e9 le premier quart du jeu, chaque niveau se renouvelle en adoptant une m\u00e9canique diff\u00e9rente et unique (notamment dans le chapitre 2). Un niveau o\u00f9 il est interdit de casser le moindre bloc sous peine d'\u00eatre sanctionn\u00e9, un autre bas\u00e9 sur le principe d'1, 2, 3, soleil avec des ennemis qui tentent de vous forcer \u00e0 bouger malgr\u00e9 tout, un autre ne contenant aucun ennemi mais qui est bas\u00e9 sur la seule gestion de votre inventaire, un niveau concentr\u00e9 sinon sur de la plateforme pure et dure... \nFranchement, les id\u00e9es sont excellentes et vari\u00e9es ! c'est dur au d\u00e9part, mais \u00e9galement super fun d'apprendre \u00e0 dompter puis \u00e0 ma\u00eetriser chacune des m\u00e9caniques du jeu.\n\n\n+ COMMANDES +\nIl est indispensable de jouer \u00e0 la manette pour en profiter. \nLes commandes sont tr\u00e8s inhabituelles, et on pourrait penser qu'elles sont mal foutues.\nEn r\u00e9alit\u00e9, elles sont pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment adapt\u00e9es aux m\u00e9caniques propos\u00e9es, et ont \u00e9t\u00e9 volontairement r\u00e9fl\u00e9chies dans le sens du jeu. C'est tr\u00e8s rebutant pendant quelques heures, mais si on accepte cette phase d'adaptation et d'apprentissage, \non se surprendra plus tard \u00e0 ma\u00eetriser le personnage comme jamais, de fa\u00e7on fluide, ultra pr\u00e9cise et tr\u00e8s agr\u00e9able.\nC'est juste une mani\u00e8re diff\u00e9rente d'aborder les commandes, mais il faut simplement le savoir et l'accepter.\n\n\n+ BANDE SON +\nInattaquable, cette OST de 83 pistes (!) est l'un des tr\u00e8s gros points forts de Towerclimb.\nElle colle parfaitement au jeu en renfor\u00e7ant son aura tant\u00f4t mystique et m\u00e9lancolique (on sent les influences de Joe Hisaishi et Koji Kondo, comme en t\u00e9moignent par exemple \"Chapter 1 Ending\", ou \"Temple of Devotion\"), tant\u00f4t compl\u00e8tement folle et d\u00e9jant\u00e9e, avec une sorte de bitpop cosmique super entra\u00eenante (l'incontournable \"Flex Flash\" et les th\u00e8mes du \"Final Battle\" vous convaincront \u00e0 coup s\u00fbr). Ah, et les FX sonores sont excellents aussi. Franchement ce jeu, c'est un r\u00e9gal pour les oreilles. J'ai d'ailleurs achet\u00e9 l'OST sur steam, et c'est la seule que je poss\u00e8de !\n\n\n\n- DEFAUTS -\n\n> Impossible de mettre le jeu en pause ! Alors \u00e7a c'est incompr\u00e9hensible, je n'ai jamais vu \u00e7a ailleurs.\nHeureusement qu'il y a de nombreux safe spots pour pouvoir souffler un peu, se gratter le dos, ou commander une pizza.\nMais vous savez quoi, cette bizarrerie renforce \u00e9trangement l'immersion du jeu.

Get 1-2 real climbs in and you'll see. It's incredible 10/10.\n\nBought Catacomb Kids and it ran like garbage on my machine so used the refund to get Towerclimb. It had been on my wishlist for a long time and every time I would go through to thin the herd a bit the trailer would always get me excited and it would survive the thinning. Finally I bought it. Now, my first impression was actually not so great. The tutorial level is pretty brutal and I felt the controls were very slow and clunky at first. I even considered refunding it. Boy am I glad I didn't. I made a few climbs and it did not take long for me to realize just what a great purchase this was. This game is incredible fun and addictive. Just when I think I\"m getting a good strategy the game throws a new challenge at me. The diversity of levels and orientations and obstacles is staggering and once you get a grip on how the game controls it no longer feels clunky. It feels very tight and polished.

After every death, you get a death card, and then you start over from the bottom. You have no healthbar; one mistake and your dead. Luckily the game provided revives to help you along the way, but they won't be of any use if you aren't careful. When I first started playing the game, I only thought of it as your typical hard-as-hell rougelike. But every time I died, I went straight back to climbing. You will gradually get better, and the progress is easy to see. Overtime the game has gotten to me. The music is wonderfull, unique, and suprisinly fits each area very well. Along with that, each area has new elements to it that add to the unique challenge each area provides as you climb with the few resources the game provides you. On that note, it is vital that you must utilize everything the game gives you to be succesful. A blast berry you didnt pick up might have you wasting a resource later on, or those golden berries you missed might have become the revive potion you so desperately needed. \nSomething so simple as climbing a tower has provided more entertainment and rewarding gameplay then some games do over their lifetime.

It may not look like it from the store page, but there is quite a lot of stuff in this game. It starts to really get interesting once you get halfway through the game.

Like a few others, I went into this thinking \"Cool, it's like Spelunky, but you climb. I'll give it a shot.\"  I had no idea how wrong I was.\n\nIt took some time to get adjusted to the new world of vertical ascention, but every time I'd re-enter the tower, I'd climb a few feet higher than the last, with every step of the way being met with a fresh new challenge, and all new traps to keep my confidence in check. It's a pain, but such trials only fueled my determination to keep making my way towards the top.  It didn't take long before I knew I was hooked.  I had to know what was up there.\n\nMy whole climb was filled with thoughts of what mystery awaited me at the top.  An amazing treasure?  A ferocious guardian?  Every foot higher that I climb pushed me harder to keep going, but I was not prepared for what awaited me at the top.\n\nIt's uncommon for a game to completely catch me by surprise and leave me stunned, but making it to the top only made me realize that there was much, much more to this tower than meets the eye. And honestly, what I found at the top was exactly what I wanted to see the most.. but it's something you'll have to discover for yourself.\n\nIf you're a tough customer who's ready for some true challenge, then get your gear ready because I cannot recommend this game enough. It's gameplay, atmospheric soundtrack, controls, and challenge are all in perfect sync with one another to create a truly unique and solid experience that towers above other roguelikes.

Most games just churn out the same protagonist over and over. Despite a simple procedural trick, I feel much more involved with the characters and their elation when we find a pair of climbing gloves, and their fear when they fall from an almost-fatal height.\n\nTowerClimb's visual style is a combination of dynamic lighting and crunchy pixels, and it's beautiful. The character animations are expressive, especially when the avatar pushes against a block or wall. That specific animation almost looks rotoscoped. I can imagine a backstory where the Climbers don their ceremonial one-color climbing suit. The color changes for every climber, so it feels like each avatar has a unique identity.\n\nThe controls don't make sense at first, but perservere and they become natural.\n\nThe gameplay is tight, hard but mostly fair, though the giant worm miniboss is a bit OP. Even touching its abdomen is fatal, and I think that makes it really to escape it when one is cornered.\n\nThere are lots of secrets and side-quests, so the replay value is high, though I haven't beaten the main quest yet I can imagine playing through multiple times to explore the secrets.\n\nThe music is great, and very evocative of each level's theme. The music in panic levels, like when the lava rises or the worm chases you, is pretty good at getting novice players to crack under stress and die, which is always entertaining. It takes some concentration to tune it out, but it's doable.\n\nThere's substantial support and hints on the wiki, so novice players such as myself can pick up a lot of the knowledge required for a successful run, but don't be fooled, this game is very skill-based. The game includes a playthrough log, so I can clearly see that I'm getting progressively better.\n\nI'm glad it's not item-based, and I'm glad that nothing carries over from my previous runs. The game is very well balanced, and you will become a better Climber with experience.

It is very difficult, and every death comes as a learning experience. There are tonnes of nuances and tricks that you learn as you play to improve your speed and efficiency, and figuring new ones out is always satisfying.  Compared to other games in this genre, Towerclimb plays much slower, and many players actually dislike that weapons aren't something you get to use very frequently. There also isn't any form of unlock system found in other roguelite games where even if you die you're still making progress.  Despite this, TowerClimb is perfect for those who don't mind starting from square one at every death, and love learning from their mistakes.  \n===========================\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n===========================\n-Extremely difficult (for those who enjoy that sort of thing)\n-Very few deaths feel \"unfair\", and even the ones that are unfair are still a learning experience\n-Excelent sound track\n-Photos of all of your deaths get listed on a handy-dandy chart so you can view your progress and possibly see where your mistakes have been made \n-The wiki isn't very expansive. This is a good thing, as finding things out on your own is just so much better.\n===========================\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n===========================\n-Extremely difficult (for those who don't enjoy that sort of thing)\n-Some runs can take upwards of an hour , so if you don't have much time to spend on this game you might not like it\n-The main mode as a \"side quest\" that is heavily dependant on RNG being in your favor\n\n-------------------------------------\n\n[b]TL;DR:[/b] It's a wonderful game. Very tough, but with many different nuances and tricks, you can learn to master the tower.

Il s'agit d'un des meilleurs repr\u00e9sentants que je connaisse du genre \"roguelike\", assez similaire \u00e0 Spelunky dans l'esprit.\n\nLe monde (la tour) est rempli d'\u00e9l\u00e9ments tous plus \u00e9tonnants les uns que les autres, qui vous terroriseront la premi\u00e8re fois que vous les rencontrerez, surtout si vous etes en train de battre votre record de hauteur. Tout, ou presque (y compris certains bonus) peut vous tuer, et pourtant, rien de v\u00e9ritablement injuste.

Vous finirez par savoir ce que vous pouvez faire ou non, et \u00e0 quelles conditions. Vous vous surprendrez \u00e0 passez ais\u00e9ment des lieux qui vous avaient sembl\u00e9s impossibles, tout simplement parce que vous aurez compris le fonctionnement des divers \u00e9l\u00e9ments.

Et pourtant, le filtre appliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 ces pixels, qui donne un aspect impressioniste, contribue, avec la bande son magnifique, \u00e0 former une v\u00e9ritable ambiance. \nOr, cette cr\u00e9ation d'une ambiance, quand on l'ajoute \u00e0 celle de situations in\u00e9dites par le gameplay et les \u00e9l\u00e9ments du monde du jeu, fait selon moi de ce jeu un v\u00e9ritable chef d'oeuvre.\nOn voit que la personne (je crois qu'elle \u00e9tait plus ou moins seule) qui a fait ce jeu l'a travaill\u00e9, avec passion, jusque dans ses moindres d\u00e9tails.

You can take all the time you want to strategize your actions and manage your items. (except when there is lava, but that's close to non-existent in later stages)\n- A perfect run require to fill your inventory with key items, which makes the game all the more challenging for those who could find this game somewhat easy.\n- Multiplayer. Reviving your teammates is cheaper than reviving yourself. Inventory is shared among players so there's no way to cheese the legend fragment run ;)\n\nCons :\n- 1 checkpoint, practicing the later stages can be very brutal.\n- No steam achievement (yet ?)\n- The coliseum of 50 waves, oh dear.

Such include bug sanctuaries, factories of death, disco club of twisted apparitions etc. There are some deadly secret areas to such as the world within the arcade machine as well as bonus unlockable game modes like Z-Ball.\nThe levels themselves are randomized each time you play so you\u2019re forced to learn generalist strategies rather than rote learn layouts.\nI've played a lot of roguelite platformers (also involved in making one called \"Aura of Worlds\"), and I found that TowerClimb has provided over 100 hours of engagement post main campaign. I still need to complete the bonus challenges such as the Colossus arena and 7 legendary fragment run...\n\n\n[h1]TLDR:[/h1]\nWant a game with a focus on explorative wonder and strategic challenge?

So, let me just say up front. This is a game that requires a lot from you. And well...I came close to not reaching those requirements. See, the controls are very unusual - They take a LOT of getting used to and they are VERY frustrating to use at first. So frustrating that, for the past half hour of play, I had been seriously considering getting a refund on this - But not due to any real fault of the developer. Any other time, I would have been okay to just eat the paltry \u00a36 cost and put it on my \"to come back to\" pile. But I am currently between jobs, so I do not have the luxury to do that. If I got a game, I told myself, it had to be something I would be happy investing in, so at first, I was close to refunding it. \n\nBut then I got better at the game. \n\nOh man. This is the sort of game you got back in the day where you intially find it terrible, but because you were a kid and refunds weren't a viable option, you'd keep muscling through, trying to like it...Until eventually you have that breakthrough and end up adoring it. \n\nSomething clicked with me on my tenth run, and I got all the way up to floor 8. It was exhilirating. \n\nI would give this a tentative reccomendation, just...Know what you're getting in for. But if you're the sort of gamer that can deal with wonky controls if it results in a wonderful experience once you're used to it...Go for it. I've made far worse investments on Steam.\n\nEDIT: 24 hours of played time later, and I have to say that the game only gets better as time goes on. Everyone thinks I'm an utter lunatic, but I love this game now. I love it so, so much. I will not spoil anything, but...After the halfway point (You'll know when it is), the game just takes a massive, unpredictable turn and goes absoloutly off the wall. Saying any more would spoil the \"WHOAAAAA\" aspect of it that I had, but...It is almost Undertale levels of out-of-nowhere depth and change. \n\nAnd something I forgot to mention before? The music.

It will take probably 30 min to reach the checkpoint and 1.5 hours to beat the game starting from this checkpoint. Total game length is approximately 2 hours.\n[*]No Save & Exit feature\n[*]It has permadeath\n[*]Pixel Graphics\n[*]This is not a rogue-like game but has rogue-like elements, you should buy this game mainly because you like platformers. I Don't recommend buying it if you are looking for a rogue-like game.\n[*]Controls: Scroll down to the Controls & Physics section for the reason why.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Game description and my experience[/h1]\n\nIn this platformer your goal is to reach the top of the tower. This will be mainly achieved by climbing the side of blocks and wall of the tower. There are 46 floors (excluding many secret floors). The theme of the floors change every 3 floors, like 3 snow covered floors after 3 lava maps etc. The floors are littered with blocks, enemies, items, chests, obstacles and sometimes a witch which will sell you potions and lifes or a crafter which will craft items if you hand over multiple items and a small fee for crafting (check out the wiki for item combinations). Resources help you overcome the tower and on some floors it is a requisite. So gathering resources is an important element in the game. Items can change your character's properties like raising run and climbing speed.\n\nOn normal difficulty you will carry one extra life which can be refilled at the witch for a few golden berries, which are spread throughout the floors. The layout of the floors is randomized thanks to procedural generation and keeps the replayability high, creating unique situations and is the major reason why I think this the most replayable platformer I have encountered. This also makes sure the game involves a lot of skill and takes away being good at the game by memorizing the level unlike many other platformers. You will die a lot in this game not because the game is unfair but more like the slightest misstep often result in death.You need to train yourself to become better and reach higher floors. Persistency is key here. It took me 15 hours to reach the checkpoint and finished the game exactly at the 100 hour mark for a game with a length of 2 hours while I'm familiar with difficult platformers.\n\nThis game is about improving your runs which will probably happen with baby steps. The game can play with your mental state for example, when you are closing in at the end and aware that every small misstep means that you throw away all your progress can make an ordinary jump look like an extreme hurdle, it suddenly becomes a scary thing. The process up until the moment you die is fun but never frustrating and can be tense. The reason is because this game is fair, there are no cheap shots. If you die it always is due to your own fault. Once you get the hang of the controls and being familiar at what the tower is throwing at you the experience changes from a slight tense to a relaxing one where mastering the game feels almost zen-like. \n\nReaching higher floors feel rewarding especially clearing the game similar as what Dark Souls does. Level design is not only diverse for its graphical appearance but also for its playstyle. Some floors require fast or slow climbing, avoiding certain enemies, let you use more resources or force you to use certain objects. You are not simply playing the game but rather experience it. Conquering the tower feels like completing an epic journey. \n\n[h1]Controls & Physics[/h1]\n\nThe first thing you will notice when starting out is the, what you will think of, weird control layout. There are multiple functions assigned to a button. For example jump and attack shares the same button, so you cannot attack without jumping. This is done because there will be moments where you have to do a combination of different actions within a short timeframe like jumping, catching an item, store this item, dodging an enemy, Scroll through your inventory to take a different weapon and attack the same enemy. It doesn't work if you are playing twister on your controller when using one button for every action. The control scheme does make sense, although this doesn't seem obvious when you first start out, keep this in mind. This point is repeatedly brought forward in negative reviews, people don't seem to understand.\n\nThe most common things I don't like in general with platform games are lag between controls and the actual movement of the character, the feel if as characters are walking on ice especially when turning around or floaty physics. There are no such things in towerclimb, the controls are responsive, tight and the physics are spot on. You may struggle with the controls due to the layout and it takes a while before getting used to as described above. Another important factor to me is the flow of the gameplay, which is fine in this game, you are always on the move.\n\n[u]Small sidenote[/u]: Using the left trigger while holding the right one and vice versa on a xbox 360 controller doesn't work. Using them simultaneous is impossible. You can solve it by using the cheap software called Controller Companion on steam. Even if you don't buy this game I highly recommend that piece of software.\n\n[h1]Graphics, Sound & Music[/h1]\n\nThe graphics of this game are minimalistic. You can argue that it is a step back from modern gaming but in the end it comes down whether you like the pixel style. I like the pixel style and also see it more as an art style. Despite the minimalistic approach there is a lot attention to detail. When it comes down to sounds there is great diversity although simple. Every item has its own sound when executing an attack, throwing or picking it up. Enemies have different sounds for movement, patrolling, attacking, being attacked etc. A strong point of this game is its great soundtrack. The musics fits the game very well, from ambient eerie sounds, mysterious tunes to dance music. It has characteristic tracks with great diversity. It really helps setting the mood on a floor.\n\n[h1]Final Word[/h1]\n\nI played a lot of platform games in my life from old school titles like the Mario, Crash Bandicoot and Donkey Kong Country series to modern platformers like N+ and Super Meat Boy, but I have to say this is the best platformer I have played. DKC2 was my favorite one for almost 20 years up till the moment I played towerclimb. It is also the most difficult, replayable and addictive one, a true classic in my book and ridiculously overlooked. A prime example of an indie gem lost in a sea of titles on steam. Or like a reviewer mentioned ''It's probably the best kept secret on steam right now actually''. Worth every penny. One thing that can make this game even better is a level editor, including level sharing via steam workshop.

Now I'm 20. [/h1]\n\n\nTowerClimb is a very unique game. It's probably the best kept secret on steam right now actually. It never holds your hand, and every foot gained is a foot earned. \n\nIt's more of a personal thing with me though. Everytime I play I experience something different. Something exciting. Something heartbreaking. You learn about life with every decision you make. You get better and climb higher. \n\nI've read many reviews and heard from many people that this game's controls are too difficult. They've added default controls for xbox controllers and you have a tutorial that teaches you everything you need to know, But there's always so much more to discover. I think if the controls are what hold you back, what doesn't in your life? \n\n\nDeath snapshots are a great way to casually laugh off your failures as well. They snap a photo right as you die and you can look through all your photos and see how you messed up.

The game is everything you want from a platformer, and more: mainly so, it's not predictable, you can play through the game for the 100th time and still have a hard time with even the first couple levels. This is also one of the few platformers that is an actual challenge (excluding the \"unfair\" games, but they are just trolls), as in everything you see on your screen likely will one-shot you before you get a full idea of how to not get one-shotted.

You achieve this mainly through platforming. There are climbing mechanics, your character can climb on walls and ceilings to get to where they need to go.\n\nThere are a ton of items you can use to survive and climb higher. These items add a very light RPG element to the game and different players will have different preferred methods for survivng the terrible tower. \n\nThe art design look great. It has a very dark and foggy atmposhphere.

In the inventory you have to press CTRL to switch items per example. The tutorial then asks to place a crate, but items are automatically thrown away when you release the button, so you have to hold the button or the item will be thrown. To place the crate on the ground, you have to throw it upwards, which is a strange solution but alright. Then I get a weapon and I am supposed to attack with it by sprinting and jumping at the same time (???) It just all feels so wrong, the hotkeys chosen, the way they need to be executed, so much feels wrong, im sorry. I rather watch someone play it than play it myself. \n\nAlso why does the 30seconds intro play every time ?\nEdit: You can close the intro with pressing \"X\"\n\n@Devs, you really need to rework this control system, its a total mess and breaks all conventions of what people know about controlling a platformer. Its strange, complicated, unintuitive and makes me want to stop the game before ending the tutorial. Keys are somewhat rebindable but these are mostly that can not be fixed by changing keys.\n\nTowerclimb does simple things wrong that Mario did right 20 years ago. \n\nLet me know when/if it is reworked and im changing the review no problem, but I currently can't have fun with it.", "timestamp_created": 1458761570, "timestamp_updated": 1460519232, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.388254", "comment_count": "24", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1458769537, "developer_response": "There's so much misinformation in this review.\n\nYou've only played 30 minutes, barely enough time to even scratch the surface of this game or it's controls, or why they were made this way.\n\nYou claim that you can't jump off the wall \"like in super meat boy\". If you played this game longer than 30 minutes you'd have easily figured out this can be done with jump potions/aura. Comparing this game's controls to simple twitch platformers like meat boy is like asking why a roguelike isn't as simple as pacman. It's simply an invalid comparison. There's much more that can be done in this game. Here's a quote from someone with 500+ hours playtime: \n\n\"People have complained that the controls are very inconvenient and don't make very much sense. Trust me, they do, and you'll get the hang of it with some practice.\" \n\nPlay, and you'll see that the controls make sense once you understand the game and it's nuances. There's a lot of subtle things you can do. This game is very strategic, complex, and vast. Do not expect to be good at the game in 30 minutes.\n\nYou claim throwing the crate upwards is the only way to place it on the ground. You can simply hold down and drop it. Since the tutorial didn't tell you this word for word, you thought you could only place it by throwing it straight up.\n\nYou claim the intro plays every time. You can skip it by pressing jump.\n\nYou claim switching items with CTRL isn't explained, when it VERY CLEARLY is.\n\nYou simply got frustrated at a game you didn't play, and a control scheme you didn't immediately understand, and left a negative review full of misformation, based on controls you don't understand. There's a reason many people say this game is among their all time favorites; just read any reviews with actual playtime.\n\nIf you get frustrated by learning a unique control scheme then this game might be too much for you.

So to end i Highly reccomend this game for someone who has been looking for that certain game that will make you feel damn good about getting higher in higher in this Tower, also the community is one of the best with everyone always willing to help you out on your jouney to the top.", "timestamp_created": 1454614851, "timestamp_updated": 1454614851, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508996", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20903215": {"recommendationid": "20903215", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029358523", "num_games_owned": 122, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 4244, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501746026}, "language": "english", "review": "A masterpiece in terms of both gameplay and visuals, Towerclimb boasts near perfection in its level design and plaformer mechanics.

I wasn't sure if I was going to like it at first. Seem very brutal with only 1 extra life (2 with easy mode). However as I watched others play it I knew I had to get this game.\n\nIt's intense.\n\nOnce you know how the control works it becomes an incredible journey. You are a man/woman. You want to climb the tower. You are weak but you are resourceful. You never felt so impowered and powerless at the same time. You feel the clinging to the rock as if your life depends on it. There is jumps that you will question because you won't be sure if the distance is close enough to make it. You will be put in situations that may force you to use an item because it's the differnce between life and death. Often death will come A lot. The controls are tight, the music fits perfectly, and I like the art (pixelated, not the weird filter seen in the trailer).\n\nIt's a good game. Strongly recommend it if you enjoy Spelunky or other roguelike/lite games.\n\nLast, there is a log of all the deaths you encounter with a kill screenshot for each one. It's really cool to see your progress on an interactive graph. If you ever feel discouraged playing this game, take a look at the graph and you can see yourself get better as you play. I still die on lower floors but it makes me want to climb higher.\n\nEDIT: After completing the first section of the game I was pleasantly surprised at the additional content that is available. This game, in theory, has a ton of replay value. There is a challenging game mode aside from the main story that takes everything you learn from the main game and mismatches it all.

Earthy, low-resolution pixel art combined with pretty lighting effects oozes atmosphere. Tight, responsive controls. Lots of level variety, fully destructable environments. Sometimes it makes you think slow and carefully, working your way through environmental puzzles while trying to conserve resources. Other times it will push you to your limit, forcing you to work you way up the tower as fast as humanly possible. 6-player local cooperative (fantastic). Supports split-screen or same-screen, but I have yet to test that feature.\n\n[H1]The Bad[/H1] Technically primitive. Screen stretching not implemented well, so playing without a black border seems like a no-go (for now). Head-scratching interface choices (Shift-Esc to exit to main menu?), and analog controls that desperately need a dead-zone adjustment. One slip could kill you, you don't want it to be the fault of your controller. The control scheme itself could benefit from few more buttons, as you often find yourself playing twister with your fingers to pull items out, keep them in hand, and use them with care.\n\n[H1]The End[/H1] Highly recommended for fans of the Rogue-lite genre, specifically fans of Spelunky.

I wasn\u2019t sure if I should pick it up or not for what it is.\nI do love plattformers. I do love the roguelike genre so I figured I can\u2019t do wrong.\nYup I was right. The game\u2019s incredibly fun. I can honestly see myself playing it whenever I just want to take my mind off of things.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nThere\u2019s no real story as far as I know.\nAll that I know is that you\u2019re one weak human with an iron will and one goal: to reach the top of the tower.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nKeyboard or Controller. Pick your poison. I\u2019ve tried both and I\u2019m just more comfortable with a controller as of now but that might change.\nThe controls are rather simple. You\u2019re able to walk or run, jump and climb walls.\nIn order to climb up or down you have to cling to it first. That my friends is crucial. That means that you have to press the key/stick against the wall, hold the jump button and hold it while climbing either up or down. As soon as you let go or if you\u2019re not paying enough attention to it you let go and, in most cases, fall to your death. Thankfully there\u2019s an option called invert climb. Basically you don\u2019t have to hold the jump button in order to cling to a wall just press your key/stick against the well.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=591178339\nThe same goes for running. You can choose between holding a set key/button in order to run or if you run by default.\nLet\u2019s talk about jumping. There are two forms of jumps. Jumps while running and while you\u2019re standing still. While running you\u2019ll jump further and while standing you\u2019ll jump higher. So you\u2019ll see you\u2019ll have to make some precise jumps if you don\u2019t want to take a bath in some [b]h a w t[/b] lava.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=591177508\nNow onto the potions. You start off with four kind of potions.\nThree blues, three reds, one green and one revive potion.\nThe blue ones allow you to perform one double jump. The red ones allow you kill enemies and to break blocks. More importantly if you throw such a potion down while jumping it\u2019ll give you small boost which you can use to get higher or further. The last one is a revive potion which will revive you once most of the times. I say most of the times but it depends how you die. If you fall down in lava for example that\u2019s it. If you try to impale yourself on some spikes it\u2019ll revive you.\n\nNext stop: items.\nThere are different kind of items. So far I\u2019ve found a sword, a boomerang, crates and so on. I\u2019m pretty sure there\u2019s a ton I haven\u2019t found yet. To make it short: You\u2019ll use most of the items to give you a boost in mid air. So it\u2019s best to experiment what the items do and how you can use and abuse them. The witch sells you some items if you have enough berries for her potion of youth. Or whatever she uses those for.\n\nBerries! No need to drool we won\u2019t be eating those.\nSo far I\u2019ve seen three different kind of berries. Blue, red and yellow.\nThe blue and red ones work the same as the potions. Yellow on the other hand speeds you up while climbing which is pretty neat.\nThen there are golden berries. Those are pretty much the currency in the game and with those you can buy various things from the witch as I said earlier like the potions which you\u2019ll really need if you want to reach the top.\n\nLevel design is next up.\nDepending on the RNG, and how far you come, you\u2019ll find yourself in different kind of levels.\nI\u2019ve had the pleasure to get a lava stage three times in a row. Basically lava will [i]slowly[/i] rise and fill up the level so you\u2019re under some pressure to find and reach the exit. The music isn\u2019t any help to not stress you out.\nAnother level I\u2019ve successfully died in I had to control some kind of balloons and maneuver one through a bunch of razor sharp fans. \nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=592024535 \nMy favorite one so far is the water level. Basically you\u2019re able to [i]swim[/i] through the stage which is a nice change. You just have to watch out so that no worms or fishes try to eat your face. Fun times.\n\nThat\u2019s pretty much it as of now. There might be a lot more but that\u2019s all I\u2019ve seen as of now.\n\n[h1]Visuals[/h1]\nDeactivate depixelize. Please do me that favor even if you hate pixels. The game looks so much better without that option. The game looks gorgeous. It maybe could be a bit more defined here and there and might be a bit rough around the edges but overall I\u2019m more than pleased with the looks of it. The combination of the look, controls and the music \u2026 For some reason I enjoy every death.\n\n[h1]Audio[/h1]\nThe music in the game\u2019s just good.\nIt gives you a sense of mystery while playing, is relaxing in some instances and then it pressures you whenever you\u2019re trying to not bath in some lava.\nI especially like the sound effects of the enemies My favorite sound must the hound even though it looks like a dog(e).\n\n[h1]What else can I say?[/h1]\nThe Tower wants you dead. Keep that in mind. Not to mention the RNG can be a real pain in the ass but we\u2019re all used to it by now. Well I know that I am and that I don\u2019t mind so called [i]unfair[/i] RNG.\nTowerClimb is a really fun game that you can play every now and then either in short bursts or for the whole day. It\u2019s challenging but at the same time rewarding. Just making it to the exit of a level is pure joy \u2026 just to find out that the tower decided that you\u2019re not worthy of him and gets you killed in one way or another.\nOverall it's a lot of fun.", "timestamp_created": 1451852881, "timestamp_updated": 1451866780, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 25, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.639548", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20150558": {"recommendationid": "20150558", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052329710", "num_games_owned": 123, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 153, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489536905}, "language": "french", "review": "C'est suprenant.

It's hard to put my finger on exactly, but I think it was a combination of soft-edged sprites and synth woodwind soundtrack that gave a lot of titles a deep, otherworldly feel. TowerClimb somehow manages to evoke that same sense of depth and wonder while relentlessly murdering me again and again in the most delightful ways.\n\nPart of the unique feel of TowerClimb comes from the mysterious, parable-like setup for the game. There are immense stone towers, people keep trying to climb them, and no one knows what's at the top. You control a never-ending series of unfortunates who challenge the tower, mantling up through floor after deadly floor. It plays a lot like a reverse Spelunky, with your character able to run, jump, scale walls, and crawl along ceilings in search of the exit high above. In place of treasure are tools like crates and springs, and golden berries that can be traded for potions that let you double-jump, break blocks, and teleport.\n\nYou're going to need every move and tool at your disposal, though, because the levels in TowerClimb are bizarre and merciless. Sometimes you'll enter a level and it'll start filling with lava. Sometimes everything will be coated in acid. Sometimes carnivorous worms burst from the walls. And sometimes there are pleasant, floaty dandelion-things to ride... straight into the jaws of a bloodthirsty hound. Even if the level gimmick isn't out for your hide, the random generation might very well give you an improbable network of tricky jumps to the exit, far worse than anything you may have encountered in the likes of Spelunky. I'm not kidding about the challenge here, and if not for all the neat things to find and entertaining ways to die, it might not be worth overcoming.\n\nBut there is indeed a lot to discover in the tower, and the pixellated graphics make experimentation essential to figuring out what you're encountering. Enemies may get the best of you the first time you meet them, in part because they can be very unpredictable but mainly because you might not know what they are at first. You'll run into all manner of plants and animals, NPCs, chests, shortcuts, and more among the randomly-generated floors. Navigating is always challenging given some of the layouts, but your control over your character is very precise and allows for masterful moves once you fully grok the mantling.\n\nIt's hard and you're going to die a ton, but TowerClimb makes it look so good you'll hardly mind. The graphics remind me very much of the old SNES Lemmings port, with chunky detail and silky-smooth animations and bizarre, impossible terrains. Sound design is also excellent, with some very detailed effects and a soundtrack reminiscent of ancient titles like Soul Blazer and Super Metroid in parts. The unexpected nostalgia rush definitely colors my view but make no mistake, TowerClimb is a tight, challenging roguelike platformer with plenty of wonders to offer.\n\n\n\nDid you enjoy this review?

Towerclimb is slower, grittier and even more difficult. You have to be even more careful and it's more about evasion than killing stuff. It's fun cause it's difficult and you die a lot. There are several general level themes in the first part of the game (standard caves, jungle, lava caverns...) and special levels (rising lava, water levels, levels where you fly on giant flying plant ballons and more/weirder).

Im serious! That's [i]literally[/i] all this game is about! The experience whilst climbing the tower however is unbelievably satisfying and I have to admit i never though i'd see myself replaying this game again.\n\nThe game is kept extremely simple. Simple controls, simple UI (I think all there is is that menu on the left that displays your current inventory, items etc) simple shop/npc system (All ive seen so far is some guy asking for stuff and a witch selling you potions/items) and simple goal (Get to the top). In fact, there really is no reason to look at a wiki or guide for this game since everything is so simple to figure out (Or that could just be me).\n\nI think one thing the game does very well is making everything your own doing.

Im not one to look into wikis and guides cause in my extreme minority opinion, looking at a guide or wiki destroys a very large part of playing the game (Figuring out stuff!).

If you get frustrated because you keep pressing the wrong button at the menu screen and accidentally closing it, and that just puts you off so much that you're just not in the mood to play anymore, you may need to work on yourself a little bit before you're ready for this game. People have complained that the controls are very inconvenient and don't make very much sense, trust me, they do, and you'll get the hang of it with some practice. Besides, you can rebind your buttons as much as you like in the options, until you find something that suits you. I use a keyboard rather than a controller, and I can operate with as much precision and skill as anybody. Give it a try, you won't find this game short on playtime, and these developers are worth supporting.", "timestamp_created": 1447367646, "timestamp_updated": 1447367646, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512975", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18997984": {"recommendationid": "18997984", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041737078", "num_games_owned": 127, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 7, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1447133116}, "language": "english", "review": "Bought and installed the game with the intention of playing coop with my brother.

Also, the enemies are quite interesting anf bursting with personality when facing them.

I entered into the beta long before this game had a steam release, and being inexperienced with difficult platformers at the time, I was unable to make any real progress through the first chapter (the only 'finished' part of the game at that point). The game managed to keep me going despite my failures, as each death felt fair to me and reminded me that I just needed to get better. Eventually I put the game down, not out of frustration, but out of anticipation for its full release and the day I'd be able to come back with a little more skill. When I heard this game got a steam release, I was beyond excited. While waiting for my steam key from the devs, I dived into the game once more to prepare myself for the new hazards the game would throw at me. After many losses, I finally did it. I beat chapter 1 and finished the beta. I was dumb and thought that meant I had a pretty good handle on how to play the game. \n\nThen I got my full copy and got to play Chapter 2. It makes Chapter 1 look like a big tutorial.\n\nMy god, the game is so much harder on Chpt. 2. You have to plan every movement you make and know how to move quickly yet carefully. Every new area I reached made me ecstatic. It was such a rewarding experience to triumph over a stage that looked unbeatable before. As long as I've played this game (probably quadruple my time on steam) I have not beat this game as of the time I write this review, but I've gotten very close. And I won't stop until I do. \n\n||| Opinion of the game:\n\nThis game is a ton of fun and a fantastic example of a platformer roguelike. As it stands right now, it's got a ton of content, challenge, and replayability. With many items to find and manage and a new crafting system, there's a lot of incentive to explore the stage a bit and maybe even risk your hide to open that chest that lava is about to overtake. Even for those who beat Chpt. 1 + 2 (Considered the story), there's the centurial trials, 100 floors of mixed and matched biomes and enemies to provide an extreme challenge for those who are looking for it. This being said, the game DID and STILL DOES have some issues that need to be ironed out. The options menu, while previously non-existent, is still a little lacking. It provides basic resolution options & fullscreen, splitscreen toggle for multiplayer, a fast scaling toggle, toggles for shaders and an ugly (IMO) filter that's on by default, as well as a controls menu. I can't find any sort of options for audio, which is fairly annoying considering how simple it would probably be to add them. It's still not a huge deal given you can just use your audio mixer.\n\nThe controls are also something to get used to. A lot of people will prefer controller to keyboard with how many binds the keyboard demands you use (and most of the time, very quickly) but until the most recent patch, the d-pad on the controller didn't really work with the game. That's been fixed, though. Still, be aware that the controls will probably be harsh to you for a short while, but they're far from unusable.\n\nThe visuals are going to probably turn a lot of people off of playing the game, and I wouldn't say that's entirely unfair. Most of the pixel art is extremely low res, your character being about 30 pixels total. Some people are going to find the graphics pretty appealing for low-res pixel art, it's really all down to your preferences. The shaders and particle visuals are pretty as well.\n\nThe game is extremely difficult, but the game is very much fair and does a good job of making you feel like everything that went wrong with your climb was your fault or preventable. RNG not playing a huge factor means your experience and skill that you develop while playing will stick with you and are the main factor in deciding the distance you climb. RNG only really comes into play when you reach chapter 2. [spoiler]The Segmentation plant and Volt Caves[/spoiler] can be significantly tougher if the stage layout decides to be a dick.\n\n||| Conclusion:\n\nA tough as nails but surprisingly fair and rewarding platformer that expects you to plan & execute your moves carefully.\nIt's a bit rough around the edges when it comes to the options menu and the controls, but the few issues that exist are being ironed out. I also forgot to mention the sweet ambient soundtrack. Highly recommended if you're into roguelites/platformers.\n\nEdit: For game award!", "timestamp_created": 1446434945, "timestamp_updated": 1491364019, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500697", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18607912": {"recommendationid": "18607912", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993942841", "num_games_owned": 373, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 623, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474522444}, "language": "english", "review": "I haven't beaten the game yet, and I imagine it will take me a while.

You begin to understand how the monsters and traps work. Then, gradually you can get to floor 8, then 10, then 19 and finally you beat chapter 1. And when you do reach the top for your first time your heart, I gauruntee you this, will feel like it is about to explode with a mix of anxiety, fear, and joy. Then your baloon ride up puts you into chapter 2. You can relax a bit at this point because you can now access chapter 2 content without having to beat the tower again. Which BTW...\n\n**Acessing chapter 2 is done by picking-up the \"2\" to the right of the Tower Entrance and bringing it to the portal during the new game scene. The skull, if brought to the portal, activates Centurion Trials.**\n\n On the negative, a downside faced by new players is that It has *very* nuanced and subtle mechanics and \"tricks\" that are not laid out clearly. Almost none of these tricks are required for beating the first chapter but knowing them and using them well makes the climb to the top significantly safer.", "timestamp_created": 1443808532, "timestamp_updated": 1443808532, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18272825": {"recommendationid": "18272825", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001544477", "num_games_owned": 151, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 15, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1444938013}, "language": "english", "review": "I got this game back when it was in beta, and it's easily one of the hardest, but most satisfying and fun games I've ever played.

The controls are solid, and at first glance, seem extremely simple. However, with enough experimentation and practice, you'll slowly realize a whole spectrum of mobility options available to you. With each technique you learn, new paths to traverse the difficult terrain will unfold before your eyes.\n\nAlthough most of the story is inferred, this is a game rich with music, ambiance and theme. The slow ardous task of climbing could have made for a very dull game, but each floor offers out new and exciting challenges to overcome. Throw in some different random events and variations, and you'll be thankful for just an extra second to plan your next move.\n\nThe core themes of this game are mastery and discovery. Each set of three floors you surpass will lead you to a new \"zone\" which will have a different visual theme. Watch the trailer if you want to see some of those in more detail. In addition to the mechanics that must be mastered to progress through each zone, each zone has a sort of philosophical theme that you must master as a person, as well. For example, some zones test your ability to plan ahead, whereas others will test your ability to think quickly.\n\nOne thing to note is that this is a very difficult and punishing game. Normally, sessions only take less than 30 minutes. By my first 30, I had died probably 25 times. However, as you learn, you will blow through the early stages very quickly. Reaching the first and only checkpoint takes about a 30 minute session, once you've mastered the controls and concepts.\n\nCurrently, there is no way to save any progress inside of the Tower. Once you unlock the checkpoint, that's it. People have suggested a save/quit feature, and we may see it in a future patch. \n\nRegardless of whether another checkpoint is added or save/quit gets added, I still fully reccommend this title. There is so much to enjoy and there are tons of unlockables that take quite a bit of effort to achieve.\n\nEasily one of the best features is the local co-op; this game is a blast if you have some friends around to play it with.\n\nIf you've read this much of my review and you're on the fence about making the purchase, just buy it.

I originally bought the beta and I've been playing it for a little over one year and I'm still not bored of it.\n\nTrying to set my bias aside, here are some pros and cons about TowerClimb:\nPros:\n- Replayability: TowerClimb has probably the most replay value I've seen compared to most dungeon crawlers, rogue-likes and similar games. Every time you play you get different events, you discover to new areas and you die in a variety of fantastic different ways (105 different deaths to be exact).\n- Aesthetic: There are a lot of pixel-art oriented games out there, especially in the genre of platforming, however TowerClimb does it quite well above and beyond the rest. Using a blend of visual effects and pixel-art you get a wonderfully crafted world with complete consistency.\n\nCons:\n- Controls: While TowerClimb is great, I am curently at a stand-still with the controls. Even after mapping the controls to a controller--GCN controller in my case--I am still not quite happy with them. Over all you've got probably 12 different keys needed to play, for example: 3 for potions, 3 for inventory, 4 to move(possibly 5 if you re-map jump) along with the run key and item-store key. So the controls can be a bit of a mess a first, but they are re-configurable with up to 25 different profiles, so there isn't too much of a problem once you've finally settled in.\n\nMy overall score is 9/10.

Dripping with otherworldly atmosphere, aided largely by an awesome low-fi soundtrack. Puzzle platforming at its finest (and deadliest). That's how I'd describe this unique little (huge!) game, but that wouldn't even come close to doing it justice.\n\nAs you might've read from other reviews, the controls take a while to get used to. You might call it the first big challenge of the game. Thankfully, you can map them however you'd like, and after a few deaths you'll begin to develop a particular instinct for it. I play on keyboard, so I can't speak to the issues people are experiencing with gamepads-- but I can say that on keyboard, the only barrier to mastery is your own skill. One of the first lessons you'll teach yourself is when best to hold the run button. The answer, unless you're very skilled, is rarely \"always\". Taking your time, planning your route and using all items to your advantage is the key to success.\n\nOnce you've mastered the controls, the real challenge awaits: 100 floors, no saves. That's Chapter 1, anyway. Each floor is themed to a particular 'biome', and each biome contains its own set of enemies and challenges. Scattered around the levels are various items you can use or store for later, such as jump berries or crates. The levels being largely destructable, sometimes you must use your collected arsenal to jump larger gaps, blast a path through the terrain, or kill enemies that stand between you and the exit. On top of this, special 'events' may trigger upon entering a new level. I won't spoil them, but suffice it to say you'll never quite know what to expect on the next floor!\n\nA quick word on the graphics: What you're seeing in the screenshots is NOT how the game can look at its best! By default, for some inexplicable reason, there is a filter called 'de-pixelize' being applied. If you want the best experience, immediately toggle the 'de-pixel' setting OFF in the graphics options! I don't know quite what they were thinking when they added this, as it wasn't in the beta, but I think it makes everything look like a bad SNES emulator. The sprites were designed and work best as pixel art; the player character and various enemies you'll encounter have very minimalist sprites, but the de-pixel setting blends and smooths their edges in a way that looks quite ghastly to me. Maybe this opinion is a product of playing the beta for so long without this option, but I don't think so. I don't like the filtered look on my SNES games, and I don't like it here. It somehow manages to reduce the details, turning crisp graphics into wet goop. Don't use it, you won't miss it.\n\nIn summary:\n*Challenging and rewarding gameplay\n*Beautifully rendered (as long as you switch de-pixelize off)\n*Incredible, moody soundtrack and effects\n*Difficult to master, and may prove frustrating for more casual players, or those who struggle with platforming\n*Best suited for keyboard play, but gamepad support is currently being improved based on feedback\n\n\nFor how long it has the potential to keep you engrossed, TowerClimb is well worth the price, and I was satisfied with my purchase even before it came to Steam and received a ton of new content!", "timestamp_created": 1443256797, "timestamp_updated": 1443256797, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18198295": {"recommendationid": "18198295", "author": {"steamid": "76561197968152343", "num_games_owned": 1204, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 413, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452493108}, "language": "english", "review": "The greatest horrifying deathtrap climbing simulator you will ever play.", "timestamp_created": 1443255105, "timestamp_updated": 1443255105, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18197858": {"recommendationid": "18197858", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993406161", "num_games_owned": 151, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1332, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467668393}, "language": "english", "review": "Legit cool stuff.", "timestamp_created": 1443252677, "timestamp_updated": 1443252677, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18196854": {"recommendationid": "18196854", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026726457", "num_games_owned": 1453, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 122, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1443239156}, "language": "english", "review": "I've been playing this long before it released on Steam and was hooked from the first time I loaded it up.\n\nIt's a unique adventure every time you spawn, thanks to the procedural/random level generation and events, as well as having some great music and pixel graphics.\n\nMost importantly the gameplay is difficult yet fair in that death is often caused by a mistake rather than a glitch or impossible AI ( but remember to manage your inventory of potions and items, or the game gets challenging really quickly! ).", "timestamp_created": 1443245729, "timestamp_updated": 1443245729, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18181097": {"recommendationid": "18181097", "author": {"steamid": "76561198161440771", "num_games_owned": 90, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 917, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487540527}, "language": "english", "review": "IWBTG + Roguelike platformer.

Many men dreampt to reach the top... Today, I am one of them.\n\nTowerclimb is a phenomenal platformer with a handful of roguelike qualities, such as random level generation and permanent death. To reach even the end of the first chapter requires skill, dedication, patience, and let's face it: A huge helping of luck. Because you -will- fuck up. You -will- make a mistake. That mistake will most likely be your end!\n\nBut that's okay! You start with one revive potion! And not everything is out to get you! Almost everything, maybe even 99% of everything, but not completely everything! You'll start out with several supplies, like jump potions and potions that blow up blocks, and one that teleports you within a short range. You can replenish these potions by collecting Golden berries, usually placed in a precarious location, and trade them tower inhabitants such as the Witch. You can also give items to a guy who will craft stuff for you, but he'll charge you for new items that he makes and sometimes he'll give you junk. \n\nIt's so hard to review this game without spoilers, because a lot of the fun comes with exploring the world of the towers and discovering very subtle hints as to the lore of the world. As well, discovering new items, creatures to fight, and traps to overcome can be extremely rewarding from a standpoint of \"Am I skilled enough to do this?\". The atmosphere is simply as beautiful as it is deadly, which is to say very. I simply can't praise this game enough, and recommend it to everyone who appreciates difficult, yet rewarding challenges.\n\nThe levels change after every 3 to 4 stages, and each has it's own unique theme. Each level has many variations to it that are possible, as well, both in design and gameplay.  It is extremely rare to have an unfairly generated level, and even those can be overcome by conserving and using your supplies at the right times. You will have to manage how many potions you have left, and you'll have to carefully consider climbing routes. Maybe instead of blowing up that block stopping you from climbing up the side of the tower, you can long jump across a gap and find a way. Maybe instead of teleporting in the Ruins, you can find a gust of wind to make you soar to the next platform. It makes you think about the safest route, and it makes you pit risk against reward. Sure, you could go for that treasure chest past the lava pit, right behind that pulsating, hatching beetle egg. But at what cost? Will the reward be worth it, or will it be just another gold berry? Well, maybe I can safely explode a wasp nest instead and get one from there. Or maybe I'll climb the side wall as far as possible and avoid that nonsense altogether, finding an alternative route. Maybe a rat will fall on my head and explode me. Maybe ???? will happen!\n\nThis game has come SO FAR since the Alpha 5 years ago, and even far from the Beta. I am super proud of Davio and Quazi for releasing this game, a game that deserves far more attention and adoration than it is receiving at the time of this writing. So, I'll leave you with this. If you love a difficult and rewarding challenge and won't run away, if you can laugh at yourself when you die, if you can accept that you will make mistakes and will learn from them for next time, if you love discovery and mystery, if you love chunky pixel art and amazing music, this game might be for you. Just two last things, eh kid? If you fall, you di... I mean you lose. And if you see your character go \"?\", climb quickly! Beat cheeks out of there!

Well, you'll be in for one hell of an adventure, that's for sure. It's brutal, it's challenging, but it isn't entirely unfair. Take your time to learn all the secrets and before you know it you'll be at the top of the tower all through your own determination and skill.\n\nThere isn't much I can say that the trailer doesn't do for itself. But it should be made known that you can actually die more than once on any given run. It depends on a combination of luck and skill, but there is an item in the game that can revive you in the event that you die in a manner that doesn't destroy the body. You start every playthrough with one revive potion, and you can get more if you're lucky/daring. I can't really explain it well without typing an obnoxious amount of text up, so it's best to look up gameplay or try it out for yourself to see. But the bottom line is: I've managed to die about 4 or 5 times on one run because I was so lucky.

I've played a lot of platformers. Super Mario games are great, but they're always relatively easy to blow through with little difficulty, and a lot of other games just always mess up small details that makes it not quite that game I'm looking for. Then along comes TowerClimb, and everything is about as close to perfect as it can get.\n\nGraphics:\nI know there are a lot of games out there that have pixel art, but let's be honest here, they don't always do it well, and that's why they don't always look good. Davioware and Quazi really nailed the detail on their game in this category. The amount of detail put into everything is exquisite, and it really makes for some nice eye candy.\n\nFor some reason there's an option for depixelizing the game that is on by default, and I highly suggest turning that off, as the smoothness to me just doesn't look as good in my opinion. Some may like it I suppose, and that's why the option is there.\n\nMusic/sound:\nThis soundtrack is incredible. Once you hit chapter 2, the music hits this level of epic that just blew me away. At times I wanted to just put the controller down and just jam out to the music. Chapter 1's music is awesome as well, but it feels like it's just one level below the second chapter.\n\nThe sounds of the game are incredibly satisfying. Whether I'm slicing into a beetle, killing a dog, or dying for the 50th time, every sound is fitting, enjoyable, and adds that nice little touch to an overall great experience. All of it just feels like it was well thought out and well composed. Top notch here!\n\nStory:\n\nThe story is interesting, deep, and definitely makes one think despite how simple it appears. You are a climber, and you are climbing a tower that many have tried to climb before. You may fail, but you may succeed. Take it from there! Yet somehow there's so much more to it than that, as this tower has some history, and it alludes to it in many different forms. It is almost akin to jumping into the world of The Labyrinth. \n\nGameplay:\nTake Super Mario World. Now add climbing, extra jumps, item hopping, teleporting, and weapons, and you have the controls for this game. It feels amazing to control. The controls are extremely responsive and expect you to be too. The controls are straightforward and easy to learn (with the exception of item hopping, which I suggest learning), yet take a lot of practice to master. Even after mastering the controls, you have to learn how to deal with all the different situations you encounter in the game. since this is a roguelite, there's perma-death, which means you're dead when you die. No checkpoints. No quicksaves. No ranking system to beef you up for your next journey. You start with the clothes on your back and the determination you set out with.\n\nSeeing as how this is a roguelite, there's an expectation that this game is hard, and it is. It is incredibly hard. This game has to be learned. Rather than rote memorization, expect to know how to deal with beetles swarming you, or being dropped into a den of hounds. Or both, since there is indeed an edge of cruelty to this game. There are items to help you through all the terrors of the tower, and they can be greatly helpful to moderately helpful, ranging from gloves that help you run faster to seeds that hold explosive berries and jump berries. All these items can be stored in the inventory for later use or carried on hand ready to be used in some capacity. The items are really well thought out, and the limit on items makes one not feel too overwhelmed with useless items yet sometimes trying to figure out which items is the least useful at the time. Expect to die until you figure out how to use items wisely and be resourceful.\n\nSummary:\nPersevere and the rewards shall be bountiful, as this game really feels great to run through. Climbing up and down the towers is just a pleasure to do, and this is my personal go to game for when I want to blow off some steam. Don't expect to be good at the game to start, and don't expect to find everything quickly. This game will chop off your head, hand it to you, then make you figure out how to eat it. But when you figure out how to eat it, oh does it taste so good! It's definitely my favorite game of the year, and possibly my favorite game of all time.\n\nScore: 10/10\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1443003012, "timestamp_updated": 1443003012, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 43, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.702712", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18156238": {"recommendationid": "18156238", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999126126", "num_games_owned": 172, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 18, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1445482065}, "language": "english", "review": "My friends and I played the shit out of this game a couple of years ago.

You play as one of many who seek to climb to the top of an ancient stone tower. The path is wrought with many obstacles, including enormous creatures, traps, and supernatural events. Along the way, you'll encounter strange characters and find useful tools to aid you on your journey. As you progress, you'll uncover a hidden lore and various side-quests in order to unlock the mysteries of the towers.\n\nSimilar to games like [i]Spelunky[/i] and [i]Just Get Through[/i], the game is split into randomized levels, each with different themes and variations to keep things challenging. Unlike [i]Spelunky[/i], however, the game is slower-paced and is much more methodical. You can't just breeze through with a Teleporter (not to knock its difficult skill ceiling). Ascending the tower is a careful process. Not all paths will get you to the exit, so planning and patience is a necessity. Because of this, the game expects the player to have skill, mastery, and knowledge of the game's finer mechanics as one mistake can cost you the whole run. Also, there are multiple environmental mechanisms that need to be mastered in order to traverse the game's later levels, similar to [i]Donkey Kong Country[/i] or [i]Super Mario[/i]. In true roguelike fashion, death means an immediate game over -- there are no checkpoints or saves (though revival potions can be bought from vendors). \n\nThe platforming mechanics of [i]TowerClimb[/i] are unique. Climbing is simple but important: it allows you to save yourself from falling to your death, and you can even climb across ceilings and the bottoms of platforms. Jumping is interesting in this game as you start with a single limited leap. However, items like potions or special berries can allow you to jump multiple times in succession. Even finer skills of the game allow you to throw items downward to give yourself a boost when there's no other solution. Destructive items double as weapons against enemies and erasers to change the generated terrain. There's other items that modify your abilities, but they aren't necessarily needed in order to succeed. Everything about [i]TowerClimb[/i]'s gameplay shows a great deal of polish, which is remarkable considering the small development team of two. \n\nMy favorite thing about the game is its atmosphere. I'm reminded of [i]Risk of Rain[/i], where your avatar is only a few pixels tall, and everything else is incredibly vast. It adds this great sense of mystery and wonder to the game. Even from the beginning, as you enter the tower, you face a looming ominous portal bathing you in an intense violet light. On the ground floor, it's apparent that the path ahead won't be easy, even on the first level. Giant rats and hounds look truly monstrous in comparison to you, and the creatures only get creepier as you climb higher. Environmental hazards can be just as deadly. Just about anything can happen in this tower: from lava bursting out of the ground to entire levels filled with water. Compared to how gigantic everything is, you can't help but feel a sense of humility. Exploring the tower can make you feel almost insignificant, and you're reminded of just how fragile you are when braving the many dangers that surround you.\n\nAesthetically, the game is done in a pixelated art style. It uses low-resolution graphics infused with hardware accelerated lighting effects and rendering capabilities, and gameplay runs at 60 FPS. You can choose to play the game with its raw pixel art or with a blended filter that somehow manages to look even more retro. However, the soundtrack really steals the show. The game features more than 80 dark and foreboding tracks. It reminds me of RPGs from the 90's on consoles like the SNES or the Sega Genesis. It definitely makes your quest feel epic, and I can't imagine playing this game while listening to something else.\n\nAs much as I love this game, it definitely isn't perfect. The game doesn't have a tutorial, so players might have a hard time mastering the basics in just a couple of runs. It's a pretty difficult game that will offer challenges to players of all skill levels. It feels awkward to play the game with just a keyboard, so I would definitely recommend using a gamepad. Graphically, I know there are lots of players out there who are tired of the pixelated art that's found in many other indie games. Sometimes, items and hazards aren't easily recognizable and can cause some frustrating ends to runs. However, the development team is incredibly dedicated and is open-minded to suggestions and ways to improve the game.\n\n[i]TowerClimb[/i] serves as a testament to how amazing indie games can be. It started as a humble demo on GameJolt and was Greenlit on Steam in 2012. It's taken Davioware and Quazi [b]6[/b] whole years to develop and polish the game. They didn't put it on Kickstarter or crowdfund the game. Just by playing it, you can feel how much love and labor was invested into this project. $15.00 may feel like a little steep of a price for this game, but I feel that they've definitely earned it after creating such an artistic masterpiece. This game is a great little reminder of how much beauty and depth can be found in unassuming simple things.\n\n[b]TL; DR:[/b] For fans of platformers, roguelikes, and good games.", "timestamp_created": 1442983514, "timestamp_updated": 1443116514, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.562126", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18154815": {"recommendationid": "18154815", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038166818", "num_games_owned": 224, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 542, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1457470471}, "language": "english", "review": "great game)this will really give you the roguelike feeling you were searching for.\nP.S.

Every run is an intense experience, and the higher you get into the tower, the better it gets. When you get to a new place, way up in the tower, that you've never been to before, you're just swarmed with so many different emotions that it's hard to describe. The amazement of seeing the new place, the fear of dying and having to start all over again, and the sense of accomplishment, all at once, makes for an unforgettable experience.\n\nThe mechanics are solid, altough it can be pretty difficult to get the hang of the controls for new players.\nOnce you learn the basics, though, you're gonna have insane ammounts of fun.\n\nThe atmosphere and soundtrack are also spot on, and make the experience even better.\n\nIf you like a good challenge, do yourself a favor, and give this game a try.

That's what I still think after playing it for more than 2 years. I've never played a game as challenging and rewarding as towerclimb. When I first starting playing, I thought I'd never beat chapter 1, but when I finally did, I was ecstatic. I thought I was a pro, who has conquered towerclimb and all the challenges it has to offer. Then the centurial trials appeared. 100 floors of pure insanity... I knew I'd never beat it. \"That's just for fun, right? People aren't actually expected to beat this.\" Hundreds of deaths and hundreds of hours later, I finally reached floor 101. I beat the trials. It was the most amazing gaming experience I've ever had. Being on floor 90 and knowing that I can lose it all with one tiny misstep is the most scary feeling I've experienced in any game. Not even a game like dead space could keep me continuously on-edge like that. \n\nTowerclimb is an emotional rollercoaster that can bring you intense feelings of fear, frustration, happiness, excitement, etc., and the music is a big part of that. The music fits the atmosphere and scenarios perfectly. In the plant-controlled observatory, the music feels as if it's alive, and creeping up on you. In the cold, icey ruins, you can hear just how frigid it is, and you can almost feel the pain from the cold air brushing against you. In the volcanic heart, you can feel the magma boiling beneath your feet, ready to burst any minute. The industrial segmentation plant makes you feel like you're surrounded by technology and traps that are prepared to kill you whenever you get near. Giant worm fights are backed with intense music that really make you feel helpless. But once you defeat it, you are rewarded with absolute silence to contemplate the victory you have earned.\n\nDiscovery is another big point of towerclimb. The game starts with no tutorial, and at first I thought it was a simple game, but I soon started to uncover the layers of complexity by just... playing. I didn't need to look at a wiki or anything like that. Some items took me a long time to find a use for them. I used to think the golden greaves were useless because they made me so fast that it was impossible to control. But eventually, after getting used them, I realized they are the most useful item in the game.\n\nWhen I first found the bitchbane, and the game told me a quest has started, I knew I was going on an adventure, in real life. Anytime I wasn't playing towerclimb, I'd try to think about what the next step could be so I could try it out when I got home. For months, I didn't know what to do, until I discovered you can use the bitchbane to kill a giant worm to get the next sword in the quest. Then use that sword to get another sword. And finally get the last one, the Ascender. Keep in mind, at this point I already thought I had known everything that was in this game. Now here's 3 new items. I started getting more handy with their own individual uses, and eventually brought the ascender to the 101st floor to fully complete the quest.\n\n2 years later, I still have one more quest to complete, and I try at least once a week to beat it.

The aesthetics, the tone, the mechanics, it was the platformer i always dreamed of. Initially i didnt have the means to play it, but i looked up videos, read player discussions, read articles, all of this fueling my anticipation. When i did get it, I was in disbelief because i couldnt have asked for a more awesome game. I've played my fair share of indie games, & this ranks up there amongst my absolute favorites, alongside Cave Story. The soundtrack is a finely crafted work of art. The whole expierence of this game inspired my own ideas & further fueled my childhood dream of making my own games. Now, this game isn't for everyone, & the mechanics definitaly take mastery, but the adrenaline rushes this game has given me is unrivaled. So much Risk vs. Reward. I've been waiting at least two excrutiating years for the full release game, & with no release in site my passion waned. But now that the full release is finally here, I know it will once again reawaken that joyous, childlike awe that i expierenced when i first discovered & played it. I hope that you too can come to love this game as i have. I have had so many memories from just a few handful of runs alone, in my opinion this game is worth it's weight in gold.

Towerclimb leans a bit closer towards the rouguelike side of things - rather than rely entirely on your twitch platforming skills (which WILL be tested), you're asked to plan and assemble an inventory of tools and potions to help you survive, and yes, you can find yourself backed into a corner if you didn't keep enough in reserve to plan for emergencies.\n\nThe SNES-era graphics work surprisingly well, with a lot of shader and bloom effects to flesh out the otherwise straightforward pixel look. The soundtrack especially is excellent. Lots of mysterious, dark, brooding melodies that help drive you on while helping to establish a brooding, oppressive atmosphere. The tower is not a friendly place.\n\nTowerclimb is a very long and very replayable game. A single playthrough will take you through dozens of randomly generated floors, and due to the way that hazards and traps can interact with each other (ala Spelunky), you can end up in some very chaotic situations that require quick thinking to work your way out of. You'll see a lot of death screens before you get anywhere near the end of this, but it's very satisfying every time you clear a new zone.\n\nNow, back into the tower - I've got a few new deaths to meet!", "timestamp_created": 1442967450, "timestamp_updated": 1442967450, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.594650", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18152035": {"recommendationid": "18152035", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042105634", "num_games_owned": 235, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 28, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1450559913}, "language": "english", "review": "EDITED 23/9/15\n\nThis seems like it could be a pretty cool game.

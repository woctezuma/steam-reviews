Das Spiel hat einen ganz eigenen Humor, der sich sowohl in den Texten vor jeder Szene, die man spielt, als auch in den Szenen selbst zeigt. \nDas Spiel enth\u00e4lt unter anderem auch minikleine Rollenspielelemente. Beispielswei\u00dfe kann man entscheiden, ob man der Ursache f\u00fcr die entfernten Schussger\u00e4usche auf den Grund geht, oder ob man lieber weiter f\u00e4hrt. Oder ob man \u00fcber den Fluss springen, oder durch ihn hindurchwaten m\u00f6chte. Und und und. Jeder Weg birgt M\u00f6glichkeiten und Gefahren.\n\nMan kann im Spiel sehr viele Waffen finden (von der Schrotflinte bis zum D\u00fcsenjet...) um damit die verschiedensten Arten von Gegnern zu bek\u00e4mpfen. Hier m\u00f6chte ich keine Beispiele nennen, denn damit w\u00e4re der WTF-Effekt ein wenig geschm\u00e4lert. :D Es sei aber gesagt, dass man nicht nur gegen Banditen k\u00e4mpft. Zwischendurch gibt es Passagen, in denen man Tiere jagen kann und deren Felle sammeln, um sie (eventuell) bei einem H\u00e4ndler gegen Leben, Waffen und...anderes zu tauschen. Freischalten kann man neben verschiedenen Spielmodi auch noch viele W\u00e4gen, die wiederum verschiedene F\u00e4higkeiten haben.\n\nF\u00fcr 2,50\u20ac (Im Sale bestimmt sogar billiger) bekommt man hier ein wirklich witziges, kleines Arcade-Game mit Wiederspielwert. Denn: Jeder Durchlauf ist anders! Die Geschichte der drei Abenteuerer wird in Tagen erz\u00e4hlt. Und bei jedem Neustart passiert an den einzelnen Tagen etwas anderes. Sollte man es also tats\u00e4chlich schaffen, den Adventure-Mode beim ersten Durchlauf zu meistern (was ich stark bezweifle), so lohnt es sich auf jeden Fall das ganze noch ein paar mal zu spielen - mit anderen W\u00e4gen und neuen Wegen. ;)\n\nVon mir gibt's eine klare Kaufempfehlung!\n\n(Btw.

Granted, this is not some Earth-shattering monument of technical achievement or anything.  But for what it is, it is very fun and will provide you with hours of amusement.  For an idea of what the game itself is like, imagine Oregon Trail meets Galaga as written by Tim & Eric and directed by Mel Brooks (because that totally doesn't sound like some kind of monster).  The gameplay itself is smooth, fun, and well-varied.  Most of the things that you come across are pretty much random events (there is some overall structure; i.e. you generally pass through most of the same 'zones' in the same order, however what those 'zones' contain tends to be randomized), and there are some very interesting (and amusing) random events.  Controls are simple and responsive and it's controller-compatible, so you've got options there.

Its coming right for us!\n\nSome Bandits tried to roll up on me, but I shot them right in their stupid faces.\n\nThen this crazy ass Machine gun Bandit comes out of nowhere and starts going rambo on me, god damn, No rest for the wicked.\n\nAfter I blew that guy to kingdom come, I went off to find Berrys in the forest, That went pretty smoothly, tho I still fired some shots off for the fun of it.\n\nI then found a cave and went to investigate, because why not going into A Dark Scary cave at random sounds like a great idea doesn't it?\n\nSo It was darker then 9/11 jokes in that cave, When I finally reached my lighter I saw the cave was filled with bats the size of cars, they swarmed and instantly ate me....My family went on without me.\n\nThey had to Cross a River My daughter told mom to jump it, but mom Decided to ford it, and then all these damn boulders came out of nowhere, followed by more boulders jesus! Stupid Boulders!\n\nMy Wife got Gangrene, and Damn she looked horrible.\n\nThen came the Buffalo stampede, it left my wife dead.\n\nIt was upto my daughter to make it the gold rush and live on our family name....\n\nUnfortunently A minute later she was gored by Bison.\n\nGAME OVER.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\nThis was immensly fun, and very much like the Oregon Trail only funner and funnier.

Super Amazing Wagon Adventure is *not* fair though, so prepare to die. A lot. When there's more or less nothing you could do about it.\n\nYour hitbox is the entire wagon (large), but the area your default weapon can attack is one small line right ahead of you. You will get hit many, many times by enemies just above or just below this area charging toward you. Anyone who makes it to the Buffalo will know what I mean. There are other weapons, but there's no way to store or change them, so if you get something that could help you later you can prepare to fire it off about two minutes before you really need it. \n\nYour wagon has three passengers, among whom damage is \"shared\". Hits land not-really-randomly on your party members, often hitting and killing one person before the other two. It's possible to get hitpoints back but this happens on a purely random basis, and consists of either events that may or may not happen or medkit pickups you may not be able to reach. The frustration that comes when you find a rare event only to realize it's your 1-HP guy instead of your 4-HP guy that you have to try to finish it with... agonizing.\n\nThere's some laughs to be had here; I thought it was hilarious when I had the option to either ford a river or jump over it, and then later either go around or swim under the river. There's also a ton of content and different paths your adventure might take; I was still finding new ones until I finally quit playing. \n\nIt's a shame I'm not going to see the end of the game though because I cannot put up with these deaths that I have no real control over. If the hitbox on the wagon was a lot smaller and my gun could aim a little I'd probably play the hell out of this game.

Simplistic, low-detail sprites represent your wagon, your party and anything else that may or may not want to kill you - and the former grossly outnumber the latter.\n\nEqually retro are the sound effects, with beeps and blops and a catchy MIDI-ish soundtrack.\n\nGameplay is like a sillier Oregon Trail - normally you control your wagon along a linear course, avoiding obstacles and shooting at things that (rarely don't) want to kill you. Your party has individual life bars and you lose once all of them are dead or missing. Events pop up after every gameplay section, ranging from shooting train robbers, to choosing between fording or jumping a river, to some rather spoiler-y occurences.\n\nThere's the main campaign mode, and progressing through it and beating certain challenges can unlock survival modes (last as long as possible in a gauntlet of enemies), shuffle modes (your starting settings are randomized from what I understand) and new wagons (which change your speed, party's health and firepower).\n\nIt's a small game and gets you a few laughs when you play short sessions of it, and it's probably in your best of interests not to take it too seriously, even if it does get a tad dark and difficult (especially difficult).", "timestamp_created": 1462282953, "timestamp_updated": 1462282953, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.665260", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22761857": {"recommendationid": "22761857", "author": {"steamid": "76561198189928643", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 174, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495957576}, "language": "english", "review": "i recommend this game\nit's just so silly and dumb (not to be offensive)\nand 1990's stlye just seals the deals \nyou should get it\n", "timestamp_created": 1462197033, "timestamp_updated": 1462197033, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22745394": {"recommendationid": "22745394", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042375567", "num_games_owned": 520, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 268, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484108952}, "language": "english", "review": "Great funny time killer", "timestamp_created": 1462118154, "timestamp_updated": 1462118154, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22737762": {"recommendationid": "22737762", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024822307", "num_games_owned": 1539, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 81, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462086605}, "language": "english", "review": "My party took the wagon on a cruise across fields, rivers, deserts, and mountains.

IF I DIDN'T PLAY THIS GAME I COULD HAVE LEARNED LIKE THREE LANGUAGES OR HAVE LEARNED HOW TO PLAY THE FUCKIGN HARP OR SOME SHIT. \n\nTHE TIMES WHERE YOU'RE PLAYING WITH YOUR MATES AND JUST FUCKING AROUND ARE GREAT; I'VE HAD SOME OF THE BEST TIMES OF MY PATHETIC YOUTH PLAYING THIS FUCKIGN GAME. THIS GAME HAS BROUGHT ME LOVE, HATE, THE RAT KID STORE, AND SO MUCH MORE. MOST PEOPLE ASSOCIATE THESE KINDS OF VIDEO GAMES WITH PEOPLE WHO NEVER GO OUTSIDE, NEVER SOCIALIZE, NEVER DO ANYTHING. I AM ONE OF THESE PEOPLE.\n\nBUT, THIS GAME GAVE ME AN OPPORTUNITY TO ACTUALLY FIND CONNECTIONS WITH PEOPLE AND SPEAK WITH THEM. AND YOU MIGHT BE WONDERING: \"WHAT THE FUCK?\" BUT NO, THROUGH ACTUALLY BEING MYSELF WITH THE MIC AND TEXT IN THIS GAME, I'VE ACTUALLY MADE FRIENDS AND I'VE EVEN MET FEMALES WHILE PLAYING THIS GAME!!!!\n\nTHIS GAME HAS HELPED ME OVERCOME MY CRIPPLING SOCIAL ANXIETY, JUST A BIT. IT GAVE ME A SHRED, JUST A SHRED OF AGENCY. I CAN COMMAND MY TEAM TO GO DEEP INTO ENEMY LINES; I CAN BE A LEADER! A LEADER, SOMETHING I AM RARELY EVER IN MY LIFE. IT GAVE ME THE CONFIDENCE TO SPEAK ON THE MIC WITH ACTUAL HUMAN BEINGS, AND SOMETIMES HAVE CONVERSATIONS! \n\nTHE INTERACTIONS IN THE GAME ARE SOMETIMES PRICELESS, FOR EXAMPLE. I WAS PLAYING ALONE, 3A.M. AND I WAS PLAYING MEEPO, ALL THE LIGHTS OFF, COMFY SHIT. THERE WAS THIS ONE MAN ON MY TEAM, HE WASN'T FROM THE AMERICAS, BUT HE SPOKE ENGLISH. AND, JUST THE WAY THAT SOME PEOPLE TALK IN THIS GAME IS JUST, FUCKING CUTE. I LOVE IT. ANOTHER TIME, I WAS PLAYING ALONE AROUND THIS TIME AGAIN, AND MY TEAM WAS ALL COMMUNICATING AND SHIT, AND THIS GUY JUST SAID: \"ROGER THAT\" I DON'T KNOW WHY, BUT IT JUST FELT NICE. IT FELT LIKE WE WERE ALL WORKING TOGETHER. LIKE, WE WERE ALL WORKING SERIOUSLY, AND AS A TEAM. \n\nLOTS OF PEOPLE SAY THAT THEIR TEAMS ARE THE THING THAT ARE THE PROBLEM WITH THIS VIDEO GAME. BUT, FROM MY EXPERIENCES, IN SOME GAMES. YOU HAVE A PERFECT TEAM, AND YOU ALL WORK IN UNISON, IT JUST FELT GREAT. AND REMEMBER, THIS WAS IN SOLO, FUCKING, QUEUE. PLAYING WITH MY FRIENDS AND DOING ALL OF THIS, AND WORKING TOGETHER, COMPLETE FOCUS ON SOMETHING IS JUST FUCKIN' GREAT. IT'S GREAT.\n\nDOIGN STUPID, GAY COMBOS WITH YOUR MATES IS GREAT TOO, OR DOING SOMEHTING FUCKING RETARDED, AND HAVING IT WORK IS BEAUTIFUL.\n\nTHIS GAME, TO ME IS A STEP TO BECOMING A FUNCTIONAL MEMBER OF SOCIETY. BUT, I FEEL THAT IT IS ALSO A WASTE OF FUKKING TIME. 4,300 FUCKING HOURS TO MANAGE TO LEARN A BIT OF AGENCY AND BASIC FUCKING CONVERSATION SKILLS IS NOT WORTH IT.

We set on an adventure in  our trusty wagon. During a hunt we encountered a unicorn, which has led us into wonderful magic field. We were promptly ambushed by a herd of said unicorn's friends.

Great sense of humor, but the lack of any truly addictive qualities makes this game very easy to put down.  There is nothing wrong with it, really.  There is just not much terribly right with it.  Very neat little game, good for at least a few minutes of entertainment if arcadey is not your thing.\n\nextended:\nThis is more or less a series of extremely simple minigames strung together seemingly at random.  Most can be summarized as such: clumsily move around on the screen while dodging pixelated blobs and clicking to fire slow-moving bullets at such.  It can be amusing to see some of the situations described or depicted in the game, but the gameplay itself is lacking.  The controls are just clumsy enough that you never get into that addictive, edge-of-your-seat frenzy that the best arcade games can inspire.  Still, they are not so bad as to incite you to throw your peripherals at the monitor, and there is something to be said for character.\n\nIf there were an option for, \"Maybe\" instead of a simple yes or no, I would choose it.  That's a rare thing for me, because I am usually pretty opinionated about the games I play.

Mais alors qu'on serait tent\u00e9 de dire \" Encore un\u00a0?\" il faut savoir qu'en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 le jeu s'av\u00e8re \u00eatre tr\u00e8s amusant \u00e0 parcourir, bourr\u00e9 d'humour et poss\u00e8de un petit c\u00f4t\u00e9 loufoque et addictif tr\u00e8s sympa. C'est simple lorsque vous commencer \u00e0 jouer \u00e0 ce jeu vous ne savait pas quand vous allez arr\u00eater tellement on s'amuse sur ce titre. \n\nAlors le jeu en soit est d\u00e9j\u00e0 amusant  mais la possibilit\u00e9 de \"personnaliser\" son aventure en cr\u00e9ant les personnages de notre petite \u00e9quipe en se basant sur des amis rend l'aventure encore plus dr\u00f4le. Voir son meilleur pote mourir pi\u00e9tiner par un bison ou asphyxier par la terrible odeur de putois sauvage c'est totalement d\u00e9bile mais qu'est-ce que c'est marrant\u00a0! D'autant plus que les diff\u00e9rents \u00e9v\u00e9nements se succ\u00e8de de mani\u00e8re purement al\u00e9atoire donc au final chaque aventure que vous allez vivre est dans un sens unique. Parfois deux aventures seront similaire mais tr\u00e8s souvent ce ne sera pas le cas, d'autant plus qu'il existe \u00e9norm\u00e9ment de possibilit\u00e9s toutes plus surprenante que d'autres et mine de rien m\u00eame apr\u00e8s plus de 2H de jeu on d\u00e9couvre encore de nouvelles choses \u00e0 faire.\n\nIl n'en \u00e0 pas l'air c'est vrai mais ce petit titre ind\u00e9pendant en a dans le ventre et se r\u00e9v\u00e8le \u00eatre un excellent divertissement. Je vous recommande fortement de lui donner sa chance, surtout qu'il ne co\u00fbte pas ch\u00e8re.\n\n[url=]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hS4eW91b_M[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1448380459, "timestamp_updated": 1448380471, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19229465": {"recommendationid": "19229465", "author": {"steamid": "76561198140087428", "num_games_owned": 75, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 55, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1442919179}, "language": "english", "review": "*Played a bit*\n*Ended up in space, shooting astroids with my pistol*\n\nBest game ever 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1448258236, "timestamp_updated": 1448258236, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19217178": {"recommendationid": "19217178", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075398151", "num_games_owned": 93, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 29, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1453658437}, "language": "english", "review": "The best game anyone could ever ask for!

This game is definitely the most hysterical game I've ever played! It's a really great 2D side-scrolling, shooter spoof of Oregon Trail. Essentially, Super Amazing Wagon Adventure is a series of fast-paced, wacky, and (mostly) random sequences.\n\nThere's three characters on the wagon that you can name and customize to a small degree. This is great if you decide to name and model them after people who are watching you play the game, as there's no telling what craziness will happen on their journey. The game is short, but it's challenging... something modern games are sorely lacking. However, the replayability is very high, because you will experience many different sequences each time you play the game. You can also unlock survival modes and several different wagons with unique perks.\n\nsparsevector nailed every single thing that he wanted to accomplish with this game. It does an excellent job of harkening back to old computer and Atari 2600 games (love the Motion Blurring and CRT Monitor effects). Simple and addictive gameplay, which is also reminiscent of older games. Insanely catchy soundtrack too, which comes with the game for free. Check out the \"Desert Theme (Rap Remix)\" track after playing for a while, it's freakin' hilarious!\n\nTo sum things up:\n10/10 (You gotta go tenouttaten!)\nThis is the best Indie game out there (my opinion, but I think a lot of people would agree).\nSeriously.

It's one of those absurd hilarious games that just refuses to stop surprising you hour after hour.  It starts off as a pretty standard Oregon Trail inspired adventure as you customize your party, and pick a wagon.  Then after that first ten seconds I'm pretty sure the game takes a handful of shrooms and maybe coke right to the face and goes completely off the rails.  This game isn't trying to have a compelling narrative, it doesn't want to be IGN's game of the year, and it's not trying to tun the industry upside down with it's wicked angsty edginess.  No, SAWA is a game that just wants to be fun.  It wants to take you an adventure infused with pure randomness and heart of comedy gold.  You'll jump rivers and end up in space, you'll go looking for food and end up tripping balls, you'll be making your way across the plains and then fighting a Buffalo filled tornado.  A FREAKING BUFFANADO!\n\nVisuals- The atari style graphics are simple yet endearing, and the color is perfect for the cartoony feel.  It's not winning any awards but it's perfect for the game.\n\nReplayability- This game has it!  Not because this game offers new wagons and things to unlock, but because you just can't stop from wondering what could be next.\n\nSound-  Similar to the visuals, it's good but not mindblowing.  It's everything this game should be.\n\nGameplay_  The shooting can be a bit on the garbage side which is a shame.  You'll die a surprising amount, and what you die from will usually be even more surprising.  This game at points doesn't seem to follow any rules either.  I was once killed by a bear with no way to defend myself.  If this kind of thing bothers you, may be best to look else where.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1440390319, "timestamp_updated": 1440390319, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.578548", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17684234": {"recommendationid": "17684234", "author": {"steamid": "76561198144281585", "num_games_owned": 69, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 68, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491020407}, "language": "english", "review": "I LIKE BUTTS AND HOTDOGS AND MUSTARD!", "timestamp_created": 1440364804, "timestamp_updated": 1440364804, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494641", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17570641": {"recommendationid": "17570641", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073244588", "num_games_owned": 43, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 178, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1439748141}, "language": "english", "review": "You know you're playing a great game when Michael and Trevor from Grand Theft Auto V confess their love to each other", "timestamp_created": 1439748215, "timestamp_updated": 1439748215, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17559397": {"recommendationid": "17559397", "author": {"steamid": "76561198121532969", "num_games_owned": 64, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 328, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452650997}, "language": "english", "review": "i love this game so much! if you have any idea about how to have a life, FUCKING BUY THIS GAME.

You should buy it.\n\nSlightly longer version: This game is merciless, unforgiving, and totally ruthless, just as an Oregon Trail homage should be. You are in a wagon and have a gun to shoot things. Sometimes you get out of the wagon to shoot things. If you are lucky you get medical recovery items and better guns, from shotguns to carpet-bombing airplanes. If you are not lucky, your three characters get horrible diseases and die to machine-gun-armed bandits and Civil War fights. More often than not, the latter will build up and have your journey end terribly.\n\nWhat keeps the game from getting overly frustrating (at least for me) is the humor. This game is hilarious, and it has everything from dinosaurs to satellites. The narration is fantastic, and it is worth playing for that alone. It's why I got the game, despite usually not being a fan of these types of games. Super Amazing Wagon Adventure was just too funny to skip.\n\nIt controls well, once you get the hang of it. I personally am terrible with keyboards for games, but from how it felt, I'm fairly certain a keyboard-savvy player will usually be perfectly fine. There are plenty of options as well, ranging from a number of wagons you can unlock to survival modes. With the numerous scenarios your playable party can get into, it has high replayability.\n\nThis game is $3 for a base price, and the witty narration is worth that alone. Add in the other great factors, such as the unlockables and tight controls, and you have a huge winner.

Am I just wasting my time? Are these games that've been hyped to heaven with almost no backlash just bald-faced lies spitting in my face? I have come to this point after wasting so much of my life, throwing myself over 20 hours closer to my death, playing this repetitive, poorly balanced, poorly made-in-general piece of fucking garbage. Yes, I despise this game. I have finally come to terms with that conclusion. I tried giving it one more chance after my first (also negative) review that's now deleted, unlocked a few more wagons and modes, but nothing changed for me except the growing hatred for this game, my grown distrust for popular consensus and for sources of game coverage I thought were reliable, and the weariness this has brought upon my life in general. I really, really hate this game.\n\nOK to start: what it looks like: an absurdist, tongue-in-cheek parody of Oregon Trail (obviously), like the video game equivalent of a Mel Brooks or an old Zucker/Abrahams movie. And that description is accurate to some extent. This is a game full of zany, random occurrences, ridiculous humor, and gameplay that, to put it one way, bears little resemblance to the original Oregon Trail. This is all just window dressing though. Strip it aside and what you have instead is a really awful vertical shmup mixed in with awful twin-stick shooter segments with a factor of randomization added to try to give it variation but they bungled it up so badly that it makes already badly done mechanics more frustrating.\n\nIf there is a singular goal in this game, it's to unlock all the wagons, since doing so requires accomplishing pretty much every possible task in the game. One wagon requires you not only unlock all five levels in survival mode, but get three full stars in all of them (which means surviving three or more minutes), another requires unlocking \"shuffle mode\" where you must survive as many randomly ordered scenes from the main game in a row (to get the wagon you need to survive 50), and unlocking the final wagon means completing the main adventure with ALL the wagons. Most of the wagons are unlocked by stumbling upon and surviving random scenarios, some rarer than others, in the game. \n\nThe main adventure allows you to ride a wagon with three attendants, which you can customize to some degree by gender, hair style, hair color, manner and color of dress, skin color, eyes, and facial hair (reserved for the men only). This is probably the most fun part of the game, not that it's necessarily interesting in itself, even if it is amusing, but because it's the one and only thing in this game that doesn't cause immense suffering. Then you pick your wagon which you only have one to start with and, if I'm being perfectly honest, is probably better than the majority of wagons I've tried so far. It sucks, but it sucks less so than some of the other crap you get. Now the concepts for the wagons sound fun but actually playing with them? No. The magic wagon has probably the worst default weapon of everything in the game, firing spread \"magic\" shots in wide angles, too wide actually, and disintegrates things when it kill them meaning you can't collect precious animal hides with it (better get a power-up!), and it fires slowly at that. The invisible wagon starts you off with 1 health for everyone, no joke, as a compromise for how small and easily maneuverable it is. If you survive the first areas and can grab full health for everyone it's great, otherwise, good luck. The space shuttle starts you all off with TWO health, has an even larger hit box than the other wagons (which are too big as it is, making the NES Silver Surfer's seem like a pixel by comparison), has only the same regular attack as the main wagon, and is faster, meaning, harder to control when you're faced by a barrage of enemies and herds of buffalo who will most assuredly kill you much faster. I could go on about how annoying and unfun some other wagons are but really it's the game itself that's out to get you more than the crappiness of your wagons (though that doesn't help).\n\nOK like I said the game is randomized, but not to the extent a roguelike or even some roguelites would take it. It's more like a Tower of Guns roguelite where there is a small amount of randomization but with mostly clear-cut, set paths, level designs and so forth, the difference being that Tower of Guns was actually not a terrible game (I gave up on some of its frustrating challenges eventually but for the most part had a good time with it). The game begins the same way every single time - you kill animals for fur, run into some bandits, seek either wild berries (or if the game wants to fuck you over, shrooms, though surviving that once does unlock a wagon - but after that, it grows tiresome), then you come to a river crossing, where you can either jump or ford it. Most of the wagons are too slow, clunky and big to bother fording, so I always jumped (which sometimes landed me in the river anyway, getting me hit by boulders coming downriver). There is one set of boulders where you must wait for them to come down, with a space opening up to go through but I swear unless you have a fast-moving wagon this is literally impossible to get through without getting hit. And it goes on and on and on. The game itself is not that long, but you will be assuredly killed repeatedly due to the crappiness of the mechanics and the random events which will screw you over big time.\n\nSometimes the game asks if you want to investigate something, like distant gunfire (which is either a bank or train robbery), but a lot of times it forces you into situations that you don't want to go into. Like, no, I don't want to save the injured falcon or get the poison gun for the billionth time, especially if I'm at the brink of death and have a perfectly capable gun already at my disposal. But it will anyway and you have no choice but to go along with it. Some situations you may as well quit your game since you will get bent if you encounter them. Like having to travel to a distant trader for a new wheel with the falcon with coyotes all over you. These segments are long and the falcon really sucks at taking down large numbers of fast-moving enemies at once. Then you die and you must repeat the process with one of the other surviving characters and you die again. And if you're forced to meet a woman in a red dress and she turns into a bandit, just... quit right there. After that you will be assaulted by bandits you have no chance of winning against. Oh, and buffalo. I don't know how you're supposed to survive the large herds of buffalo with a large wagon without a decent weapon, and if your characters (idiotically) decide they're \"bored\" and speed through the herd, you're dead, and frankly they deserve it for being so goddamn stupid as to speed through buffalo to be trampled to death by them and your poorly handled vehicle. Oh yeah there are \"twin stick\" segments where you might be alone on foot and fight enemies without your wagon or compadres. Your hitbox is more reasonable, but movement never felt \"right\" nor did the mouse aiming. There are too many fast-moving, tiny enemies hard to hit with your puny weapons with you being too slow to outrun them and eventually you'll be circled and killed. That's actually more a complaint of the survival mode than of the main game but it can happen. \n\nBut no matter where you die, whether by buffalo, by wolves on a mountain, or river boulders, the game always feels so inanely repetitive. You will encounter every scenario, of which there are very few, so many times trying to complete the game with one of your many crappy wagons and failing that it becomes a mentally numbing experience. I don't want to hunt more wildlife, bandits, berries, or choose to cross or ford rivers ever again.

Super fast-paced and quite difficult depending on what wagon type you're using. Characters die at random. Watch out for bear dens and spiders! It's like the oregon trail on crack and often feels like a bullethell. \n\nStory, Characters: The story and characters' names and likenesses change with every playthough. You're a caravan of settlers trying to settle. You can customize characters and input the names of your friends or enemies! \n\nAtmosphere, Graphics: Atari-like graphics with vivid colours.  I recommend you play in CRT mode for some pre-birth nostalgia!\n\nSound/Music:Fun chip-tune music. The best music is in the timed survival mode.\n\nI'd like to add that this game gets very difficult and it definitely helps if you do not use the standard wagon, especially near the end levels.

The weapon/cart upgrades and ever-changing story make every playthrough unique and fun-filled. \n\n8.0/10\n", "timestamp_created": 1430172773, "timestamp_updated": 1430172773, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15574965": {"recommendationid": "15574965", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047068407", "num_games_owned": 344, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 76, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1412317111}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uae30\uc0c1\ucc9c\uc678\ud55c \uc11c\ubd80 \uac1c\ucc99 \ubaa8\ud5d8!\n\uc5d1\uc2a4\ubc15\uc2a4 \ud328\ub4dc \uc9c0\uc6d0!!\n\ud765\uaca8\uc6b4 BGM!!!\n\n\uc77c\ub2e8 \uc288\ud305\uac8c\uc784\uc774\ub77c\uace0 \uc0dd\uac01\ud558\uc2dc\uba74 \ub418\uad6c\uc694.\n\ub2e4\ub9cc \uc288\ud305 \ud310\uc815\uc774 \uc57d\uac04 \ubd88\uc548\uc815\ud574\uc11c \uc880 \uc5b4\uc774\uc5c6\ub294 \uc8fd\uc74c\uc774 \uc7a6\uc744\uc218 \uc788\uc74c. \n3\ub2ec\ub7ec \uadf8 \uc774\uc0c1\uc744 \ud574\uc8fc\ub294 \uac8c\uc784.", "timestamp_created": 1430106289, "timestamp_updated": 1430106289, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15566346": {"recommendationid": "15566346", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053054381", "num_games_owned": 136, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 79, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 6, "last_played": 1513558100}, "language": "english", "review": "I've never put more effort into anything in my life", "timestamp_created": 1430073526, "timestamp_updated": 1430073526, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "4.975124", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15528730": {"recommendationid": "15528730", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084258520", "num_games_owned": 71, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 246, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1455913561}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is hard but fun.

The game features buffalo, underwater buffalo, space buffalo, flying buffalo, flaming buffalo, and zombie buffalo. Also wagons.\n[b]Length:[/b] 1-3 hours\n[b]Score:[/b] 5.75/10\n\n[b]Full Review:[/b] Super Amazing Wagon Adventure (from here on SAWA) is a 2D side scrolling shooter with pixel graphics. Occasionally throughout the gameplay things will switch to a top down view, allowing you to shoot in all directions. You play as a group of three travelers, each one has 4 HP; all riding together in a wagon (never did quite figure out how the game determines who\u2019s HP to subtract from). The game features randomized scenarios to boot. For the most part, it\u2019s pretty simple stuff.\n\nBut a review isn\u2019t complete with just the quick summary, so let\u2019s delve into it a bit more, shall we? Let\u2019s begin with the game mechanics first. The bulk of the gameplay is the side scrolling shooting portion. From a gameplay perspective, it\u2019s not anything spectacular, but it\u2019s mildly fun. The screen scrolls automatically, and you can move up, down, back, and forth as it does; all the while shooting animals that you can pick up and use as food, or fending off attacking bandits. \n\nThe top down portions let you walk about the screen and do much the same, you fend off attacking animals and bandits.\n\nThe game also features different guns for one to use, such as a flamethrower, a basic machine gun, and even the ability to summon a jet to carpet bomb the entire screen. Play-wise, it\u2019s not the grandest thing out there, but it works alright.\n\nThe game is designed to have randomized scenarios, so as to mix up the game a bit. The game still follows the same basic progression each time, starting out in a forest, then encountering a river, then the plains, etc. But the individual scenarios that make up each of those vary, and some scenarios are more common than others. The game will sometimes even give you occasional binary options, for example allowing you to use your wagon to ford a river, or alternatively you can try jumping over the river. While this doesn\u2019t mix up the gameplay too greatly, it does help add a bit more to it, especially during the first couple times playing.\n\nThe different scenarios are one of the things the game does better, as in addition to adding more variety, they also provide a small dose of humour. Granted, it\u2019s of the \u201clol so random\u201d variety, and while it\u2019s cheap and juvenile, it\u2019s still moderately enjoyable, and I did chuckle at a few of them. Such as the time I tried to jump over a river and a gust of wind sucked me into outer space, where I was attacked by buffalo. Or when the volcano erupted and rained hellfire upon my trusty wagon while flaming wolves assaulted me from the stream of lava that was chasing me. And the time when the tornado sucked me up and threw even more buffalo towards my party. (The game has a lot of buffalo).\n\nAs you play through the game you\u2019ll be able to unlock different wagons by completing certain events in game. Follow a unicorn and defend yourself from its horde of brethren before slaying a dragon and you get a fantasy style carriage. Discover prehistoric dinosaurs and you can ride upon a triceratops, and throw dinosaur eggs that explode with baby pterodactyls that home in on enemies.\n\nThe game itself isn\u2019t very long, and a successful run through will only take about 10-15 minutes, but you\u2019ll die a few times along the way. Chances are it\u2019ll take you between 1-3 hours to finish your wagon adventure.\n\nThe difficulty in the game is a bit wonky, as while the gameplay itself isn\u2019t too terribly difficult, it can be a bit cheap sometimes with how the RNG gods decide to treat you. You may, for instance, suddenly contract the measles, dropping your health down to 1 HP for a single character, or to suddenly being blessed with an additional party member to join your wagon (effectively another set of hit points). Point being that a lot of the difficulty comes down to random events that are beyond your control, and sometimes are the make or break for successfully finishing the game. That\u2019s a rather poor way to handle difficulty, and it\u2019s a strike against the game.\n\nIn addition to the main game, there are also a couple different survival modes that let you see how long you can last against different hordes of wild animals, aiming of course for the best score possible.\n\nCompleting the game will unlock a shuffle mode, which throws random scenarios at you from the game, which you play until your entire party dies. Your score is how many scenarios you can complete before something claims your life.\n\nThe game\u2019s graphics are done in a retro pixel art style, and really aren\u2019t anything special. They aren\u2019t great looking retro style throwback, in the vein of a game like [i]Shovel Knight[/i] or [i]Hotline Miami[/i]. They\u2019re bare bones, and they\u2019re really just there. Which I guess is okay for what the game is, but they\u2019re nothing to get excited about. Likewise, the music for the game isn\u2019t very notable either.\n\nIn the end, it\u2019s by no means a must have game, but it\u2019s only $3, and it sometimes goes on sale for even less than that. So while even at that price point it\u2019s not a must have, it can be a fun way to kill some time if you\u2019re in the mood for this sort of thing.", "timestamp_created": 1429424426, "timestamp_updated": 1429424708, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15392717": {"recommendationid": "15392717", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118823543", "num_games_owned": 63, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1102, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509992809}, "language": "english", "review": "10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000/10\nbest game ever.", "timestamp_created": 1429137144, "timestamp_updated": 1429137144, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15392329": {"recommendationid": "15392329", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039879089", "num_games_owned": 951, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 21, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1429134916}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Esta cosa tiene su dificultad y su gracia.

In this game, you play as 3 migrants travelling west....And that's where the similarities end. To put it simple, this game is a retro-like side-scroll shooter with randomness and humor that's all around the place. Expect wacky situations to occured when travelling west. \n- Civil war? Check.\n- Bank robery? Check.\n- Zombies? Check.\n- Battling inner demon? Check.\n- And many more\nEven your migrant's death descriptions are funny. Well, in most cases. \nOne playthrough usually last about approximately 10 minutes (maybe more, maybe less). While some argue that the short duration of each gameplay can hurt the replay value, that's not really the case in the game. There are variety of wagons that can be unlockable during the main story, and because of the randomness, you can't really unlock them during one gameplay. And the way to unlock the said wagon also worthwhile. \n\nWhat else I could say about the game?\n- Controls are responsive\n- The sound assets are catchy, and kinda fit with the whole wacky nature of the game. \n- The system requirements are low\n\nProbably the only thing I dislike about the game are the screen transitions. It's kinda fast sometimes, I can't finish reading the text. Because of the wackiness, I don't really recommend this to people that hate randomness in their games. But if you like unpredictable situations, do get this game. It's cheap, fun, and can be done in a short time, something rare these days (IMO). \n\nTL;DR: A quick game that you can play when taking a short break from your activity, and also fun.\n\nAlso, one last word.

It's very clearly based on games from the 80s. You have to get your wagon from point A to point B... and shot things along the way. There are cool powerups, interesting little random events that may help or harm your run, traders to buy things from, and multiple forks in the road to keep the game fresh and replayable. There are also different unlockable wagons to use, each with their own advantages, disadvantages, and special quirks. There's not a whole lot more to say about the gameplay. It's mostly just automatically scrolling to the right as you move around the screen and shoot. It can be pretty easy or very hard depending on your choices and your luck. It's rather short, but highly replayable. I love the art style and the soundtrack is also pretty freakin' catchy. Plus the appropriate sound effects, of course. I really wish I could write a longer, more detailed review, but that's all there really is about it. It's fun, addictive, and only costs 3 bucks at full price. If you enjoy games you can complete in a sitting, this is great. And it keeps you coming back for more with the random events and different wagons. The only downside for this game is that... I wish there was more. More stuff in it. A longer trail. More events. Just... more everything. But I can't fault the game for any of that because what it DOES have is all great and makes for a wonderful experience that not many games aim to give you anymore. If you're thinking about it, just get it. You might not sink hundreds of hours into it, but the ones you DO put into it will all be worthwhile playtime, no filler.\n\nSuper Amazing Wagon Adventure gets an 8/10 for being a very fun little experience with lots of replayability and that throwback feeling.", "timestamp_created": 1420713833, "timestamp_updated": 1420713833, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503301", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13867419": {"recommendationid": "13867419", "author": {"steamid": "76561197988812463", "num_games_owned": 139, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 301, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1419777825}, "language": "english", "review": "Cool little game.", "timestamp_created": 1420566711, "timestamp_updated": 1509378422, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13852837": {"recommendationid": "13852837", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016461214", "num_games_owned": 408, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 16, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1403964815}, "language": "english", "review": "no", "timestamp_created": 1420486475, "timestamp_updated": 1420486475, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.254218", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13841625": {"recommendationid": "13841625", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011887368", "num_games_owned": 300, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 67, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1420178420}, "language": "english", "review": "BUFFALOS???

He found a tactical carpet bombing and called it in saying \"See you all in hell.\" under his breath. But, somehow he and LD had survived, they looked around them, blood and horns everywhere...to Sgt.Bigdick it was beautiful revenge, but to LD it seemed as though Sgt. had gone mad. They were on their merry way when suddenly, bandits. LD picked up a bow and was able to shoot a few before he ran out of arrows. Sgt.Bigdick pulls out his trusty pistol that never runs out of ammo for some reason, but now was not the time to question it. He was able to pick off 5 bandits before a machine gun bandit came in and shot Sgt.Bigdick within an inch of his life, the group found a rocket launcher aimed and blew up the machine gun bandit. The party comes across a river, Sgt.Bigdick obviously suffering from blood loss has the idea to jump it before fading out of consciousness. LD had the significantly better idea to ford the river, at first all was fine then...the boulders...so many boulders. Sgt. woke up just in time to be crushed by a boulder. LD was in tears as he finally made it across the river. Just as he thought nothing could be worse than losing his superior officer...a herd of buffalo appear. LD finds a flamethrower and roasts all of the buffalo without sustaining a scratch. But then, BUFFALO...\"no\"LD whispers...BUFFALO...BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO. LD goes down in a blaze of glory fighting till he couldn't bear to go on at one health left he sees an on-coming buffalo, this was it, this was the end.

But HornyFishMan, NuggleSnugg, and HurgaDerga had to do it. It was time they traveled to the West Coast in their trusty station wagon. Leading the group, HornyFishMan picks up his uzi. They hunt. Bandits attack. Some could even aim. They reach a river. They ford it. Boulders... so many boulders... and then the pirate ship attacked. Luckily, there was a rocket launcher in the river. A few quick shots, and it's down. Suck it, Blackbeard.\n\nThe group enters the Great Plains. Buffalo buffalo buffalo. The number of buffalo was absurd. HurgaDerga is impaled by a buffalo, and I swear he will be missed. NuggleSnugg and HornyFishMan go on. Horny is healed by health kits that was bought, along with a flame thrower, with the buffalo hide. Remember, the ones that killed HurgaDerga? Revenge is sweet. They see a woman in a red dress. HornyFishMan stops to see if she needs help. It wasn't a trap, and she needs no help. She thanks Horny and sends him away. A civil war battle is underway nearby. The group says hello. There were no survivors. \n\nThe group reaches another river. It was time the station wagon went underwater. Water buffalo water buffalo water buffalo. The group reaches an island. Horny notices supplies on the shore. He takes them. It was a trap! PELICANS! Luckily, he survives. They swim to shore.\n\nThey reach a mountain pass. Food supplies were running low, so they hunted. No bandits this time, but wolves. So many wolves. They find a trader. They use the wolves they murdered to buy a double-barreled uzi. There is a snow storm, yet the wolves continue to attack. Bastards... They deal with the wolves, and see a strange figure in the distance... Horny investigates.\n\nBIGFOOT! Horny runs at him, and having found another flamethrower in the snow, takes him down easily. It is now out of ammo, though, so he gets his double-barreled uzi back out. Infinite ammo rocks! He runs back to the wagon, and the snow storm was rough, so in their panic, they drive off a cliff.\n\nBuffalo followed HornyFishMan and NuggleSnugg off the cliff. So many buffalo. They dodge all the buffalo, and manage to land safely in a river. Having lost their wheels, the station wagon became a raft. They navigated through boulders and fought off alligators. Then they reached a bandit ambush. The bandits attacked with shotguns on their rafts. Successfully defending themselves from the bandits, alligators, and boulders, the group could see the West coast. They almost made it! But then a bandit showed up. He had found some sort of steam boat. Lighting up the boat as much as possible, it wasn't enough. A bandit holding a shotgun on top of the steam boat fired, and Horny wasn't quick to the dodge. NuggleSnugg joined Hurga, after all this time. She came so far, and it didn't even matter. Horny, in all his rage, blew up the boat with his uzi, ending his bandit problem. Reaching shore, Horny shoots pelicans in celebration. He made it to the West coast, though he lost his best friends.

Even if I don't put it to frequent use, unlockables are very similar to accomplishments for me, so naturally I never get tired of SAWA. The numerous unlockables aren't just for keeping you engrossed in the game; they make you go for certain events that you may not have chosen otherwise (I'm talking about the rivers here). I personally don't like going into the desert with the snakes, scorpians, and vultures, but when I saw the locked Survival mode, I figured I'd go to try and unlock it. Because of this, I encountered new events that I never would've seen without the motivation to go back to that desert. Now I like alternating between different areas to see what kind of new or unlikely events I can trigger!\n\nThis isn't intended to be a hardcore game, but there are those kind of challenges for the people that always aim for the gold in video games. You know what kind of challenges I mean, and SAWA has them, namely the Random wagon, where you have to make it 50 days in Shuffle without dying. For those who haven't played Shuffle mode, it's a hard challenge. Take it from me.\n\nSAWA is great for gamers of all types: casual, hardcore, completionists, you name it. I definitely recommend this game, even if it's for an hour.", "timestamp_created": 1410495019, "timestamp_updated": 1410495019, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12064007": {"recommendationid": "12064007", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068109782", "num_games_owned": 549, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 151, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1419530474}, "language": "english", "review": "deseased monkeys, angry narwhals, pterodactyls, unicorn ambushes, dragons, aliens...\n100% historically accurate!", "timestamp_created": 1410456628, "timestamp_updated": 1410456628, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500681", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12040907": {"recommendationid": "12040907", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989952411", "num_games_owned": 684, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 13, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1410330426}, "language": "english", "review": "The only wagon adventure I've been on where no one died of dysentary. 11 out of 10.

The weapon options are nothing too special, and the enemies mainly rely on strength of numbers to add challenge. The boss fights that I've experienced so far were OK but no big deal.\n\nWhat really is entertaining is the silly nature of the entire endeavor.

Or, you could try fording it.\"\n[Ford]\n[Jump]\n\nAnd then you can actually jump over the river if you want to.\n\nOther times you might be attacked by modern cars or \"inner demons\", and the text that accompanies almost every event is weird and goofy. And it works almost every time, and because the game is so quick to play (the game I won probably took between 5-10 minutes) and there are a lot of options, it hasn't yet gotten old.\n\nBut it probably will eventually. And when I'm tired of seeing a million buffalo charge at me for the hundredth time, then I'll probably stop because all it has left are the mechanics, which, as stated, really aren't much special.\n\nStill, it doesn't cost much, and it still plays much better than the far more tedious McPixel (I don't know why I feel the comparison is necessary - highly pixelated graphics and bite-size gameplay I guess, but nothing else much is in common so *shrug*) and I still foresee getting some quality time out of it, so I would recommend it!", "timestamp_created": 1406903127, "timestamp_updated": 1406904811, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.670272", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11500579": {"recommendationid": "11500579", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085888807", "num_games_owned": 571, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 548, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1466785011}, "language": "french", "review": "M\u00e9lange shooter scrolling horizontal et rogue-like, donc si vous aim\u00e9 ce style allez-y les yeux ferm\u00e9.\nApr\u00e9s pour ce prix vous attendez pas a un blockbuster.

It's fast, fun and ferociously insane and made me laugh many times - or how often have you been dodging a rain of buffalo while falling off a cliff with your space-shuttle-pulled-by-mule wagon, gripping onto your laser cannon for dear life, all in 1840?\nThat's what I thought.\nGet this game, even if only to support small developers with wacky ideas, or you might just lose three hearts to space dysentery.", "timestamp_created": 1404170929, "timestamp_updated": 1404170929, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10987236": {"recommendationid": "10987236", "author": {"steamid": "76561198127117377", "num_games_owned": 525, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 271, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491419801}, "language": "german", "review": "Dieses Spiel ist soviel mehr wert als es gekostet hat. \nInstant classic. \n\nHabe Pilze gegessen und meine Inneren Konflikte haben mich umgebracht.\n500 von 500 B\u00fcffeln\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1404168713, "timestamp_updated": 1404168713, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.710236", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10987076": {"recommendationid": "10987076", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053727322", "num_games_owned": 555, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 320, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 6, "last_played": 1513559345}, "language": "english", "review": "Oregon Trail meets WarioWare.", "timestamp_created": 1404168125, "timestamp_updated": 1404168125, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10984700": {"recommendationid": "10984700", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071247315", "num_games_owned": 16, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 29, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1404838626}, "language": "english", "review": "Invisible Wagon. 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1404161009, "timestamp_updated": 1404161009, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10984474": {"recommendationid": "10984474", "author": {"steamid": "76561198089969552", "num_games_owned": 111, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 20, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1430267386}, "language": "english", "review": "This game.

There are random events but only a select few that always occur at the same positions. Example is at the beginning you either get ambushed by Unicorns and fight a dragon or you get ambushed by bandits and fight a machine gun cart. \nIs this game entertaining? For a while, then it gets infuriatingly repetitive and boring as you never quite reach the end due to dumb luck. It would also be nice if the other carts weren't god awful or impossible to unlock.

However, since I bought Half-Life on Steam during a sale for $1.99, I think I am entitled to complain.\n\nThis game is something you would normally see on a flash games website, good for maybe a half-hour of entertainment before it gets boring.  To make matters worse, all of the wagons need to be unlocked through achievements save for the default one.  It also provides little real challenge other than twitch response in terms of gameplay.  The gameplay consists of being flashed a \"random\" message, then being thrown into a scenario that usually involves shooting animals, people, or dodging obstacles.  However, after a half-hour of play, I was seeing the same events every other run.  It turns out that the game isn't procedurally generated in the traditional sense, other than the random location of enemy spawns.  There are certain events that are fixed, such as crossing rivers, where the player is presented with a choice on how to do so.  However, most events that have a chance occur are linked to other events that is required to immediately follow, such as burning buffalo during a prairie fire only happens if there was a prarie fire, which only happens if there was a herd of buffalo, which happens every time upon entering the Great Plains level.  So there is actually not much variety in gameplay, since the event generation seems to only be based on two possible outcomes, often y/n, if a --> b ?, or based on player choice.\n\nBut I would forgive all of this, even LOVE IT, if the game was just fun to play past the 1 hour mark.  But instead, it becomes a tedious and annoying mess of screen ghosting after that.

Essentially you are thrown into a variety of bizzare scenarios where you shoot and dodge stuff for about 30 seconds or less, and then there's a short transition and you're suddenly somewhere else shooting and/or dodging other stuff. For example, you might be crossing a river dodging boulders, and then you'll make it across the river and into the prairie where you'll gun down some buffalo. The general order of events never changes (forest-->river-->plains-->desert/second river-->mountain-->freefall-->rapids/present day) but there are special random events that can occur, including everything from unicorns to time travel to pirates, many of which will unlock new wagons.\n\nSAWA is really fun, but also difficult. I've only completed it once, and I had to use the invisible wagon, which has a super tiny hitbox. Thankfully it has a good sense of humor and charming visuals and music to ease the pain of my many, many deaths.\n\n8/10 Would [strike] BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO[/strike] buy again", "timestamp_created": 1401421641, "timestamp_updated": 1401421702, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10279635": {"recommendationid": "10279635", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067272817", "num_games_owned": 85, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 200, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499987994}, "language": "english", "review": "It's super!

Amazing!\n\nOh, and there's an awesome chiptune-ish soundtrack and a gorgeous TV scanline effect, mimicking the asthetics of the old Atari 7800 games. Loads of fun, hard as hell, and hilarious as fuck, highly recommend this one!", "timestamp_created": 1386182862, "timestamp_updated": 1386182972, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505214", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "7909008": {"recommendationid": "7909008", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960805204", "num_games_owned": 450, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 807, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483070011}, "language": "english", "review": "A fun little retro-style shooter with a lot of silly interludes and random events.

It feels just like it lacks a lot in gameplay, as things are just greatly difficult to accomplish and in the beginning you just depend on your luck if you want to get far.\nIt's biggest sale point, the randomness of events is... not really that big. Yes, there is a variety of things that can happen to you, but it seems to like there isn't really that much variety.\nYou always follow a specific basic path, which then has several options of what could happen to you. Sometimes, you can make the decision, like jumping or fording a river, which basically means having the chance for a random event, like having to dodge bees or asteroids. The other decision will have you... dodge... boulders.\nIf you play it and then die and play it again, you will soon realize that there isn't really that much variety in what will happen to you. And, because the game sometimes just throws undodgeable obstacles in your way, faster than a human being could possibly react to, dying will happen to you a lot.\nAlso you seem to be very limited in what you can do. The weapons, which the game will not really let you choose to fire it or conserve it, always have very limited ammo. You have, if you coun't all the party members, 12 points of health, from which the game sometimes RANDOMLY decides to take a quarter away. You either heal from (quickly appearing) health pickups or from random events.\nThe game has a real good soundtrack though, and the design is mostly nice to look at, the sound effects also appear to be fitting and they don't get annoying.\nThe text \"scrolling\", which is not in your hand, even on the fastest setting, was still too slow for me. Why not let me decide when to skip the text?\n\nIn conclusion, the game has some sort of variety and the random events are funny at first, but they get old quickly. The gameplay doesn't have much variety, where I would really have appreciated to put more effort in. It doesn't cost a lot, so it doesn't really hurt to try it out, but I for myself, did not pull a lot of enjoyment out of it.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1385747803, "timestamp_updated": 1385747803, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 34, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.535979", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "7817346": {"recommendationid": "7817346", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042480686", "num_games_owned": 74, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 16, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1395107874}, "language": "english", "review": "Itz suuu hurd", "timestamp_created": 1385693820, "timestamp_updated": 1385693820, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497164", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "7813473": {"recommendationid": "7813473", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009827696", "num_games_owned": 92, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 61, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1400438830}, "language": "french", "review": "HAAAHAAAAHAA pas tres beau graphiquement mais le jeux est GEEENIAL AND AMAZING ^^ l'histoire change a chaque foi a vous de fair vos choix et totalement fun et WTF O_O", "timestamp_created": 1385673959, "timestamp_updated": 1385673959, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "7811936": {"recommendationid": "7811936", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051456175", "num_games_owned": 88, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 7, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1384695196}, "language": "german", "review": "Die ultimative absurde Gro\u00dfartigkeit und beinahe eine Endstation des M\u00f6glichen.

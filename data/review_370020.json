I was not disapointed. The combat is simple to understand but full of options in strategy, their are definitly more than one way to do things. The game rewards you through extra experience and RP (Requisition Points) for finishing the level under a certain amount of rounds, but it does not force you, and the bonus is small enough that it punish you for taking your time, it just gives you an incentive to be efficent. Speaking of RP, the Requisition tree is HUGE!!! It isn't that complicated once you get the hang of it however. I would suggest you only buy things that you need (eg the next level of a skill once one of your templars is at the current max and you want to keep leveling that skill, or something to spend your tech level on). Each of the 8 classes has several diferent paths they can go down skill and tech wise allowing you to create a templar to fit the exact role you want. The fact that you can change a templars skills, attributes and equipment as many times as you want, whenever, wherever (exept for during a mission of course) allows you to experiment and try new things. My final comment about this game is about the people behind it. I had an issue with the game continuously crashing one night, so I left a message on the message board. I went to sleep and woke up the next day to find that they had found my problem and had patched it, all during that night. I have never seen anything like this in any game I have ever played ever.

It's not bad for a top-down turn-based tactics sci-fi adventure.  However, I feel a bit like I settled, because the story-line is not particularly engaging to me, as it consists of verbose texts which, while obtained by speaking to static characters, seem more like designer signposts.  I do not mind reading text if it's engaging and presented in an interesting way. I am a veteran of the early text adventures from the 1980's and a fan of Planescape: Torment, so I enjoy a good yarn.\n\nThe battles are fun though. \n\nI am a bit confused by the tag, \"Rogue-like\" which is one of the tags associated with this game; as I grew up with Nethack, Rogue, et al., which are true rogue-likes.  The battles here are not random generated levels, with random items which I figured would give it more replayability.  I read some posts by the developers explaining the tag rogue-like means the save game system is rogue-like, which means there is only a single persistent save file per campaign.  The save file is not so restrictive though, the developers have it tamed in such a way as you can replay the battle before accepting the save, or quit without saving which allows you to restart and replay from where you last saved. That is the only thing that is somewhat rogue-like --and a forgiving rogue-like, at that-- as far as I can tell. \n\nIf you want a turn-based tactics adventure, and care less for an engaging story, then this is recommended.

Das Kampfsystem und die zugeh\u00f6rigen F\u00e4higkeiten (Talente), Waffen und Ausr\u00fcstungsgegenst\u00e4nde der Templer sind ziemlich gut durchdacht, doch musste ich mir unterwegs am Handy anlesen, was eigentlich welcher Wert bedeutet (was ich gut finde... eine solide Rundenstrategie kann ruhig \u00fcber etwas Komplexit\u00e4t verf\u00fcgen). Im Spiel ist das auch m\u00f6glich wird aber im Detail nur sehr trocken \u00fcber eine Enzeklop\u00e4die erkl\u00e4rt. \n\nDas Leveldesign (Incl. Gegnertypen und -aufkommen) ist ebendalls ausgezeichnet. Die Missionen sind Abwechslungsreich und interessant. Mit vielen verschiedenen Aufgaben, die entweder die Freiheit lassen alles Gleichzeitig oder in einer selbt gew\u00e4hlten Reinfolge zu erledigen oder mit sehr coolen Entwicklungen der Zielsetzung nach einem Zwischenziel aufwarten kommt es einem nur selten so vor, dass man das ja schonmal gemacht hat. Das liegt auch daran, dass die Karten relativ abwechslungsreich sind und hervorragend zu den einzelnen Missionen passen.\n\nZusammenfassend:\nKampfsystem, Gegnertypen, Templerklassen, Kartendesign, Missionsdesign... alles f\u00fcgt sich zu einem sehr solidem Strategiespiel zusammen, welches au\u00dferdem auch noch in einem coolen Setting stattfindet.\n\nDie Schwierigkeit ist auf 5 (?)

One such thing is making me look through a queue of games that I probably won't like and don't want, just to get the stupid free trading cards every time they do a sale. However, in this case they did me a service. \n\nThis game was on the list, and as I like turn-based strategy I stuck it on my wishlist. I didn't buy it until about a year later when there was an offer on it but I wish I'd bought it earlier.\n\nTemplar Battleforce is a turn based squad game where you control a team of different classes in various missions against an alien menace. There are several things that I like about it:\n\nFirstly, the different classes feel pretty distinct. There are a few that do similar things but even they have subtle perks that make them different. Maybe not as individualised as the classes on the XCOM games but still a nice selection.\n\nSecondly, despite the fact that I am not finished there is a pretty good storyline, which is often missing in games at this pricepoint. There is a whole lore and universe that is fleshed out fairly well during the missions themselves and in a few expository scenes between the main combat.\n\nSpeaking of the missions, there are a lot of them. I recently got the achievement for completing 30 missions and I think there are still 10+ to go (excuse me devs if I'm selling this short). It definitely feels like value for money in terms of longevity. Considering that there are several different difficulty levels and an ironman mode there is also some replayability too.\n\nThere are other things I like, such as the music, which ramps up the drama well as you progress through a mission. There are times where you are surrounded or struggling to work out how to defend yourself against a wave of \"Xeno\" and the music definitely adds to the tension.\n\nI am playing through at normal difficulty and that feels like the perfect challenge already. There are times I have had to reset and redo a mission when I make a mistake like leaving a tactical point undefended, or walking into a horde of tough enemies with just a scout to fend for himself. Even when I have to do this it rarely feels like the game is picking on me, and when i refine my tactics a little I can plough through, but it feels like an accomplishment rather than a chore. Once I complete it I will definitely see if I can handle a tougher difficulty.\n\nTo add a little balance to an otherwise positive review, some of the mechanics are a little hard to understand at first. It can take a little effort or some looking through discussion boards to work out what is going on. Even with this relatively minor complaint, the developers are still incredibly helpful. Despite the game being out for a long time already, the two queries I have had have been answered by the devs within minutes of me asking them, and looking at other discussions this is not a fluke.\n\nOverall, if you're a fan of turn based games then it is worth paying the full amount. Even if you're not, get it on sale.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1507374731, "timestamp_updated": 1507374731, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.600063", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35310192": {"recommendationid": "35310192", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998761337", "num_games_owned": 373, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 858, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510981966}, "language": "english", "review": "It's budget Space Hulk!\n\nSeriously, that's basically what you're getting here.

But when I got into it, the time wasn't spent on playing the game... \nIt was spent on dissecting every little aspect of gameplay mechanics up until the cultists missions.\n\nI really like dice rolling system, as a whole it's a solid 10/10 for how it \"feels\" when just jumping into the fray and letting things take their course. Attack an enemy! Hit or miss? Feels slightly more forgiving than say... Xcom. You don't have to understand how it works, it works well either way.\n\nIt's very entertaining to anyone who likes options for the sheer fact that there's options. Because there's a LOT of options. And just about any way you want to play it is valid for completing almost every mission.\n\nThere's some important information I need to impart however. If you're anything like me, you like to optimize. You like to Min/Max. You can't stand it if you complete the objective just under a perfect score. This is where I feel the game has a terrible flaw, and if the devs are still alive out there, I'd like them to take this to heart.\n\nIn order to gain new skills and equipment, you need requisition points. Requisition points are awarded upon completion of each mission you do. However, there is the possibility of earning EXTRA requisition points, and it's very clear from the size of the requisition tree that you're going to need as many points as possible. So, how do you earn the extra points for that sweet sweet \"perfect\" score? Two ways: Kill as many enemies as possible in as few turns as possible (as the score is based on an average kills per turn) AND complete the mission in general in as few turns as possible. From here, the games compatibility with all of its \"possibilities and options\" goes down the drain.\n\nPicking anything that is slower and/or safer is immediately going to be less effective in the long run. You absolutely must rush every mission while strategically picking which spots are worth stopping on to potentially snipe some poor xeno who happened to be on your speed path. The best Kills per Turn bonus I've ever gotten was 8%, and that was at 6 kills per turn. The best speed bonus you can earn is a WHOPPING 20%!! And that doesn't just apply to RP, it applies to EXP too! Getting that massive bonus is possible on almost every mission, so going without it just seems like a bad idea.\n\nNow since the goal is to go as fast as possible, this limits which character classes are valid to play with. Obviously scouts seem like the go to pick, but they're so fragile they explode instantly. Sensorkit scans supposedly keep them aware of enemies, but the scans cost as much AP as a shot and a ton of heat too. Combine this with the fact that A:running further causes more heat and B: you can't stop running because you NEED to complete the objective as fast as possible and C: you can't use sensorkits while overheated means you're out in the open just hoping that a xeno doesn't pop out the one dark tile you can't see 5 tiles away from you.\nEngineers also have sensor kits, but have far too many responsibilities to free them up, are too expensive to deploy more, and have too many skills needed to properly defend themselves AND go exploring.\nSoldiers are pretty go to with rallying charge, but they'll soon suffer heat problems and slow down.\nHydra and Neptune are fancy soldiers with a higher deploy cost, but without the soldiers practicality (Dalan Ortho 4life).\nBerserker is like the mix of your captain and paladin... good at melee attacking stuff with various buffs and debuffs but can't heal.\nPaladins are a godsend which stop for no one and don't overheat easily (until you need to start healing).\nThen there's your captain, who also stops for no one when built as a melee tank. He can speed buff himself and run through maps to do all the objectives for you.\n\nLook, I like what's here, but the game doesn't properly incentivise the use of other classes. I play this on Demanding difficulty. My sole loadout is always Captain, Dalan Ortho, and Paladin. Squad sizes are too small to make use of other classes, and the starting SP is never enough to get more than one expensive unit (which means I end up getting my pally, but never an engineer). Missions have tactical points, but the missions never last long enough for them to matter. You go in with who you have, maybe recruit 1 extra guy if there's an easy tactical point, and it's over. The game suffers from the fact that it only has the campaign (which must be rushed) and no free play.\n\n\nSOOOOO, here's my suggestions. For the reward system, make bonus objectives gives +5 bonus Exp AND Rp. For the kill system, remove the kills per turn and install a kill threshold system. I'm thinking along the lines of the threshold being hp based? So in a mission, deal 400 hp in damage as the goal, and hp is only added to the counter when the enemy is killed. Got a skittering down to 1 hp? Doesn't count. Kill it, then you get its hp value added to the counter. Going over the target value will earn bonus %, which will hit a cap (I recommend 20%, like your turn completion bonus).\n\nFor the start of missions, give out a little more starting SP. Second to this, give an option recall or add troops based on SP cost. Conversely, tweak the costs of troops so that they're cheaper, and the difference in cost isn't literally 50% of a whole unit. For some of the bigger missions you are FORCED to use some crappy soldier or scout you've never used before, but you're unable to swap them out because there's never enough starting SP. If squad sizes were a little bigger, you could decide whether you want 3 cheap units or 2 special ones.\n\nA free play or challenge mode would be nice. I would love to see how different setups fair against waves of enemies that get progressively stronger. Maybe add this mode as a reward for completing your first optional mission in the campaign.\n\nLastly, auto-block is really powerful, not sure if it's OP though. The stat is basically non-negotiable. Armor is however, in conjuction with deflection. Unfortunately anything with low deflection and high armor defeats the purpose of wearing it since everything will penetrate it, causing half the armor value to be lost. As such the only practical option is to pick high deflection suits with low or moderate armor. Not sure how to balance it for really low deflection values.", "timestamp_created": 1505215929, "timestamp_updated": 1505217188, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.598540", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34871639": {"recommendationid": "34871639", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043385216", "num_games_owned": 470, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 314, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505255382}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is really good, totally worth 10 bucks!!\nTons of options to customize your squad, interesting turn-based tactical battles and a decent story.\nThe graphics are not great, but they are ok.

Immediately after each of these thoughts \"X\" happened. I really couldn't be more pleased.  I'll break this down into a categorical deep-dive:\n\n[b]Strategy & Fun: 10 of 10[/b]\n\nThis game has kept me playing for about 100 hours thus far (my hours currently appear inflated due to AFK time. This game has a rich set of rules that govern how combat plays out. At the easiest couple of difficulties, you can survive without knowing the details. However, the well-crafted ruleset (mechanics) lend importance to every single decision you make and nuance layerd upon nuance.\n\nThe game has many difficulty levels which not only add immesurable amounts of replay value, but also caters toward those who are masters of strategy as well as the novice more interested in the story, and everything in-between.  I always enjoy myself when playing this game, win or lose. \n\n[b]Music: 8/10[/b]\n\nThe music is somewhat simple, while also appropriately bombastic, and anxiety-enducing. (This is particularly the case when I've just realized I'm surrounded, out of range of my turrets and supplies are running low.) It loops in a simple pattern, which I orginally thought would drive me mad, but surprisingly I haven't been bothered by the repetition a single time. Consider that this entire game was made by three brothers and tell me you aren't impressed that at least one of them had enough musical talent to do this.\n\n[b]Art & Graphics: 8/10[/b]\n\nThe graphics on this game are typical of an indie studio. Think around the range of a Sega Genesis game in terms of detail . However, the art is extremely good and sets the stage for the plot and overall ambiance. I'm not a huge fan of GPU-intensive games anyway so I'm pleased enough with the quality here.\n\n[b]Storyline: 8/10[/b]\n\nI won't spoil the plot here but know that the story builds as you progress in a satisfying way. I never felt a break in the immersion while playing due to a plot foible or poorly written line of text.  The game is consistently good in this department, and actually wasn't predictable to me. One nice thing is this game takes place in a broader ecosystem of games and so I feel I get value out of learning about this portion as it will apply to earlier/later titles.\n\n[b]Replay Value: 10/10[/b]\n\nOk, so I've mentioned I spent 100+ hours so far? Yeah, that's on two difficulty levels I've played. I am a slower player of this game. There are totally different sets of strategies that would end maps more quickly but I prefer slower, methodical, alien bloodbaths.  I expect to put another [b]700+ hours[/b] into this game. Why? Let's count the replay-enhancing options: \n\n1. There are many story paths you can take that aren't available in a single playthrough.\n\n2. There is a limited amount of a resource you use to give team-wise specializations (called \"RQ\" in the game) that means you effectively have *many* mutually exclusive options as you play through an entire game. Trying to get through the game without one branch of skills/items gives you more room to play with other abilities/toys.\n\n3. There are something like 9 difficulty levels. I skipped over Easy as it isn't massively different than Normal and I didn't consider myself enough of a novice to start on Easy. However, the other difficulty levels are distinct enough in their challenges that I intend to play through each at least once. (The higher difficulties will take longer, and some permanently punish failure so they'll take many times more hours to play through.)\n\n4. There is a new game+ mode through which you can continue on the same or a different difficutly with all of your skills/levels/gear that you earned throughout the game but the enemies' levels scale as well. This is the mechanism through which you can get all of the possibly abilities/gear on a single squad. However, I've enjoyed playing with famine more than feast so I haven't even tried this yet.\n\n5. There are new levels occasionally added to the post-campgain section, for free! Think DLC worth 20% of the buying price of your favorite game being released every few months or so, but at no cost to you. Pretty sweet. The set of missions they have out right now are at least as good as the main campaign.\n\n6. There are Steam achivements that might require a special setup to acquire. You could burn some hours hunting these down for sure.\n\n[b]Polish: 6*/10[/b]\n\nNow, here's really the only weak point of this game. It has some weird bugs every now and then, but I personally have never encountered any that broke my game. (I have been saddened to get a new item only to discover it was bugged such that it took no effect.) However, the asterisk I'm applying here is because the game developers are continually fixing bugs as they are reported (and I mean like within hours of the report) and adding new content, again, for free! This is truly the game that keeps on giving.  Also, if you consider the team size (3) of the developers, this is a rare masterpiece.\n\n[b]Conclusion[/b]\n\nIn closing I definitely think it is worth the asking price of $50. Wait, it's only [b]$10[/b]!?

You face unending waves of enemies which you will cut apart, burn to a crisp, or blast to pieces in droves. Managing your unit's overwatch as you move to achieve your objectives is reminiscent of the Space Hulk games. Achieving the main objectives, as well as bonuses objectives, awards you with points you can use to recruit more Templars, or upgrade existing Templar class lines. As well, individual Templars level-up over time, giving you stat points to assign, and allowing them to use more/more advanced gear.\n\nOverall, recommended.

Overheating.\n\nBasically, whenever in combat you move, attack, use abilities or run in flames (duh), you build up Heat in your mechanized armor.

While if they have to cool down and sit doing nothing for some turns, the enemies will tear them apart most likely.\n\nThis single mechanic, in my humble opinion, totally kills the combat, which is the large part of this title's entire gameplay.

Fallout Tactics (2001) and Jagged Alliance 2 (1999) come to my mind. A more recent contender may be Bionic Dues (2013, check it out if you like TB).\n\n\nThe gameplay:\nYou lead your squad of mechwarriors into battle against different kinds of aliens and human traitors. Different missions will allow a different number of templars you can deploy, ranging from 3-6. Somtimes you will find \"tact points\" which can be captured by your engineer to deploy more templars and a wide range of ordnance.\nYou can outfit your mechs with many different weapons, armor and supplemental modules, improve stats and learn many different talents (attacks, buffs, debuffs, healing, area scans, sentry turrets etc.). The types depend on the templars class and your progression in the tech tree. The tech tree is pretty huge, alowing great customization of the 8 classes. \nMission goals are diverse, so you want to use the right mechs for the job. For example, if you have to search an area for something then you better bring a scout. If you have to defend a position then soldier, neptune (heavy weapons) and hydra (flames!) are a better choice.\nIn battle, you take turns against the enemy using action and movement points. Comparing attack accuracy, penetration and damage against defence, deflection, armor and resist.\n\nThe missions are great: Full of \"oh shit\"-moments, heroic last stands, tragic losses and triumphant victories. Hold positions against a brutal alien onslaught, purge a town from infestation and secure it, storm a bunker and try to stop the menace to humanity... there are many missions and branching story paths. After 33 hours I haven't even finished the game.  Shifting mission goals keep things interesting and tense.\n\nThe story is rather deep for a game of this kind and provides a nice background for the action.

And additionally because in the case of [i]Templar Battleforce[/i], I was also reminded of its obvious [i]Warhammer 40,000[/i] inspiration.\n\nThose first impressions seem to have been on target, as after many hours of playtime in both titles, whether by design or by accident, they still evoke that comparison for me \u2014 except the \"playing pieces\" are well-animated and the game master comes with the software.\n\nUnlike its fantasy-themed cousin, the several campaigns that come packaged with [i]Templar Battleforce[/i] are written in the same genre as WH40K: grim, dark, military science-fiction. So be forewarned, it lacks its cousin's commendably intimate character development and interpersonal drama. On the bright side, you'll find a lot more wonderful science-fiction influences bubbling beneath its surface than just those of WH40K; fans of BattleTech, Dune, and even Battlestar Galactica might be pleased as well.\n\nWhatever HoS has that [i]Templar Battleforce[/i] doesn't, TB successfully makes up for it with fully customizable characters and gear load-outs, much bigger squad caps, and a whole lot of \"into the breach!\" battle-brother romanticizing that's not always quite up to par with [i]WH40K: Dawn of War's[/i] Gabriel Angelos and his ilk, but serves the purpose anyhow.

It may seam as a wierd pro, but it is a great thing, making game go from slaughterfest to desperate crusade.\n-You can reset equipment and skills as much as you like, but...*\n\nCons:\n-Story and dialogue, its not bad, but its Warhammer 40000 and X-Com, absolutely NOTHING new. Obvious plot-holes (If templars father is Berserker and mother Scout, he has memory od both, so sooner or latter everyone would have memory of every class, so how does it work, how does anything work, no backstory on absolutely anything).\n-Classes and weapons are vaguely metioned, or not even that. It is heavily liked to one above. Also, not all builds are equal, but devs are working on it.\n-*you cant unlearn starting skills even tho they become useless (taking Headshot for sniper-build scout makes Crippling shot crippling only for you, since non upgraded skill is worse than nothing - see next).\n\nInbetween:\n-Templars are as flexible as Greek phalax - not at all. This is not ment for classes, who are inflexible themselfs, as two-handed axe, flamethrower and sniper cant replace one another for obvious reasons. No, as a squad they are inflexible.

If you enjoy turn based games, give these guys a shot. The devs have great support and are constatly working toward making the game even better. First playthrough was nearly 60 hours, but game+ mode has given me a chance to exploit all the things I have learned.\n\nThings I love:\n --Free anytime respec on Skills/Attributes and Talents. Allows many different play styles and team builds. The further you get in the game, the more you unlock, the more options and builds you have at your disposal. \n--The Story style missions make each mission feel like you are doing something to progress the story. Not just a smash and grab filler. Really diverse mission types keep you testing your tactics.\n-- The devs are actively engaged with the players. The forums are filled with replies and feedback from the devs. I have been playing the game for a few weeks--2016-2017, and have noticed that many of the features i am used to are from feedback from players and dev updates to the game. That type of passion makes me want to support Trese Brothers! Keep it up!\n\nthings I'd like to see:\n--Updates to players look when getting new weapons or gear. Not a huge complaint, but when I spent a ton of RP to get a relic and it looks the same... was hoping for something visual during gameplay. \n--360 controller support. I know that is not popular opinion on \"PC master race\" but hey if it would be possible I'd like to have the option. Which from reading the forums, Trese Brothers are experimenting with. fingers crossed\n--Sequels/More levels! This isn't a complaint, but more of a optomistic request. I'm looking forward to more games along this style. Hopefully tons of people play and fund further development! \n\nKey point: dont let the graphics turn you away if you are use to more \"modern\" graphics.

In some ways, this game is comparable to the X-Com series and its various spinoffs; however, it's more streamlined and yet it maintains a significant challenge and an impressive yet simple RPG system. Customize those units!\n\nI think one of the features that will keep me coming back is the difficulty settings. Right now, I've got mine set for two levels above normal, yet there are still several more difficulty levels to master above my current playthrough. It's got replay value, especially if you're into rogue-like masochistic ironman permadeath. I'm more of a casual player, so having lots of difficulty settings is extremely appealing.\n\nI heartily recommend. I started playing last night and I've already logged several hours.

The game features over 50 levels in which you fight various alien and human enemies, leading to a playtime of about 30-35h for your first playthrough.\nYour Templars level up, get better and learn additional abilities which \u2013 if used correctly \u2013 will bring you victory. New equipment and additional classes are unlocked via a research tree. The difficulty settings allow beginners as well as pros a challenging but enjoyable time with the game.\nBuy it, it\u2019s absolutely worth the 10 bucks.\n\nSome more details now:\n[h1]What\u2019s the game about? [/h1]\nIn the grim future of Templar Battleforce the remaining humans go on what gets called the great Exodus after the Great Galactic War to settle new planets far away from their devastated home.\nYou\u2019re controlling a group of Templars, members of a martial order, who pilot giant battle suits and are sworn to protect the human colonists. You\u2019re bigger and stronger than any normal human and basically the only one who has a proper chance in fighting the threats the vast galaxy has to offer. \nGranted, the presentation is a little bit dry: Lots of completely unvoiced dialogues, no shiny CGI cutscenes and relatively unimpressive graphics. If you\u2019re willing to read you will soon see, however, the devs put a lot of effort into the lore of the game (you can also jump straight from battle to battle of course).\nThe story is motivating enough though to keep you playing and the slight Warhammer 40k vibe going on also is pretty cool.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nThe core of the game of course is the fighting. You send your heavily armed Templars on space ships, through cities or into a seemingly empty desert. Each soldier has a certain movement allowance, measured in tiles of which the levels are made of. The action points are used for attacking as well as using buffs, building defensive turrets and more. The game therefore is turn-based, requiring you to end your turn if you used up all points and let the enemy act \u2013 similar to for example XCOM.\nThe mission types vary: Sometimes you have to quickly push to a certain objective, for example to destroy a xeno lair, another time you have to capture and hold points on the map or wait for support. Usually you are on the offensive and should therefore avoid getting entangled in prolonged fights. Captured tactical points produce supply points which allow you to call in more members of your squad or buy ordnance like medi kits.\nYour squad consists of various specialists, always lead by your captain. You got the soldier who combines good accuracy and range with a variety of buffs and the extremely useful overwatch ability to control zones. Scouts are great long-rang-combat units and can be developed in either a scout or a sniper direction.\nThen there\u2019re engineers, the only ones who can capture points and erect turrets. The Hydra equipped with a deadly flamethrower and the ability to set whole areas ablaze. The Paladin, a melee warrior with a lot of useful buffs and healing abilities. The Berserker as the high damage melee unit and the Neptune, a heavy weapon specialist \u2013 a little bit like the big brother of the soldier.\nThe interface is unobtrusive and shows the range for movement, shooting and buffs of all your units; you can also get detailed info about the enemy types you\u2019re facing. Enemy variety meanwhile is decent, the majority of your playtime you will fight the Terrox xeno which look like your standard alien species and come in different versions: from small crawlers over ranged units to some really brutal late-game elites. Occasionally you find yourself opposed by some human adversaries and then, finally, you will face the Narvidians. A hive-mind race which was the cause for the already mentioned great galactic war.\n\n[h1]Progression system + research[/h1]\nIf one of your soldiers reaches a new level, you will be able to spend points on various attributes which either increase your health points, your chance to hit with a particular kind of weapon, your chance to get critical hits or your defence in case an enemy gets the chance to attack you. Not all attributes are similarly important to every class of course and some classes have special ones like the scout\u2019s stealth or the Paladin\u2019s medic attribute.\nYou will also be able to spend points on your Templars\u2019 abilities, improving them or unlocking completely new talents. Generally, it\u2019s worth thinking about which role you want each of your units to play and put their level-up points accordingly. You can easily recruit two soldiers and make one into a heavy hitter who likes to get close and personal while your other guy focusses on overwatch and defensive buffs.\nFinally, there\u2019s the equipment screen where you can give your happy soldiers new guns, a new shield or an improved armour. More advanced weapons don\u2019t always deal more damage, there\u2019re also ones which trade damage for higher accuracy or some additional elemental damage. Some armour may be really tough but slows you down etc.\nTo get new equipment and to unlock new talents, you have to use some requisition points in what basically is something like a research tree. You won\u2019t be able to unlock everything so you have to carefully choose. In which direction do you want to focus your captain? Pure melee or with a sidearm? Does your soldier need grenades? Do you want to unlock the Neptune class or rather put more points into the Berserker? And doesn\u2019t the Paladin desperately need a new weapon?\n\n[h1]Technical stuff[/h1]\nLoading times are extremely fast, the game runs stable and there basically aren\u2019t any bugs \u2013 performance overall is great.\nWhile I like the art style and atmosphere of the game, you can see by looking at some screenshots or videos the graphic isn\u2019t exactly what you would call beautiful. If you don\u2019t really care that much about shiny graphics anyway as long as the game\u2019s great that\u2019s not a concern ofc.\nAs mentioned before, none of the dialogues are voiced; the sound effects are mediocre and the soundtrack, while fitting, gets old pretty fast. I turned off all sounds for the game and just listened to some music while playing. \n\n[h1]In conclusion\u2026[/h1]\nIf you like these kind of turn-based games and the futuristic scenario there isn\u2019t really any reason not to buy this (maybe you even played Space Hulk in the past). It works so incredibly well, all classes and abilities feel useful and the mechanics are easy to get into. Building up your own squad of super soldiers which you can name, customize and level-up in any way you want feels great.\nVisually it\u2019s not the most impressive and the story and its presentation won\u2019t knock your socks off but the game itself just feels so satisfying.\nThe devs are very active, regularly checking the forums and fixing any bugs people encounter; they even add new content to the game and generally have an open ear for the community \u2013 exemplary!\nOne playthrough will probably take you between 30 and 35 hours, depending on your skill. Due to the way the requisition tree is designed the game has a lot of replay value for everyone who wants to go at it again using different strategies or previously not unlocked classes. Trying a higher difficulty level may also be an incentive; for players like me who are only\u2026ehm\u2026passable at these kind of games easy or normal are still enjoyable without being frustrating while pros can jump directly to the higher ones. Another thing to do after finishing the game is replaying the game with your veteran squad: The game offers a new game plus mode where you keep your experienced Templars, your equipment and your research level and play through the whole campaign again, if desired on a different difficulty level.", "timestamp_created": 1482501476, "timestamp_updated": 1482501476, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.674094", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28554623": {"recommendationid": "28554623", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023023836", "num_games_owned": 145, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 26, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482484985}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome little game, has some indie-dev issues but overall very immersive!", "timestamp_created": 1482485372, "timestamp_updated": 1482485372, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500067", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28491262": {"recommendationid": "28491262", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994466908", "num_games_owned": 378, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 929, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481589413}, "language": "english", "review": "Are you tired of being disappointed by WH40k titles?

I say that in comparison to Xcom (Old and New), Xenonauts, and both of the UFO series. What it simplifies in the meta game it makes up for in templar build options, map design, and the tech tree.\n\nWhile the graphics aren't on par with some AAA titles, the art is functional and clear. The only major visual complaint I have is that at times ledges can be hard to distinguish from passable terrain.\n\nTemplar loadouts opt for a system of max equip points rather than requiring the player to maintain an economy in the meta game. New gear is unlocked via a tech tree with many branching paths, requiring you to focus on a strategy rather than be a jack of all trades. All classes feel useful, though you may find a handful really shining with your play style.\n\nCombat is tense, as your templars can dish out high damage, but are almost always outnumbered. The game tends to focus on forward momentum, and rewards a mobile playstyle, as enemy spawns are infinite. The enemy spawning may be off putting for some, as it can at times be unpredictable, but it maintains the claustrophobia and tension from beggining to end. One must cover their 6 and keep their eyes on every avenue. Scale-able difficulty allows you to customize the challenge of the experience you want, from casual to Ironman deathslog.\n\nAll in all, a great purchase for anybody in the market for a turn based tactical game.

There's no base-building, it is simply mission after mission of your squad of troops against the enemy. From my experience of it so far you are normally massively outnumbered by the enemy on each mission, but to make up for this each unit in your squad is far stronger than the enemy. You'd expect 1 of your units to face off on its own against 4-8 of the enemy at once and usually come out victorious (depending on the unit's class). There are a range of mission types, such as survive x number of turns, reach a certain point, capture parts of a map, escort civilians etc.\n\n-RPG-\n\nThe RPG element of the game is awesome, and you really can specialise each unit how you want as you spend ability and stat points. For example, I have one Soldier (long range unit) in my team who specialises in the overwatch ability, so that he can guard captured bases by himself. Each victory earns you Research Points which can go into unlocking new classes, or unlocking new features for existing classes - each class has several different specialities (e.g. your Captain can specialise in close combat, support, ranged fire, or as a grenade specialist).\n\n-STORYLINE-\n\nI've been playing this game for just over 13 hours at the time of writing and I'm already hooked. I won't give anything away but I will say although it's not the most advanced storyline, it's good enough to keep you interested. I also like the fact that there's permadeath for your characters - I am already massively attached to each and every one of my characters and refuse to let any die for that reason.\n\n-IMPROVEMENTS-\n\nAt the start of most missions your team (usually 5 or 6, although this amount might increase later in the game) is pre-selected from your roster for you. You start the mission with a currency called 'SP' which can be used to immediately swap one unwanted member of your team out for one of your preferred members, but I think a massive improvement would be to just let the user pick their own team at the start of every mission. I understand for some missions you need a specific class such as an Engineer which is fine, but the user perhaps should be able to pick the rest of the team themselves after the mandatory ones.\n\nAs I've made clear though, I love this game already and this last point is just a suggested improvement to what is otherwise a fantastic game.\n\nTL;DR - Pick this up if you want a simpler version of XCOM with awesome combat missions and good RPG progression.", "timestamp_created": 1480709992, "timestamp_updated": 1480709992, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.680727", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28108268": {"recommendationid": "28108268", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071587892", "num_games_owned": 204, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1556, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488919107}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0417\u0430\u043c\u0435\u0447\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430, \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043d\u044c\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0441 \u0442\u0435\u0445\u043d\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043d\u044b \u0432 \u0441\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0441 \u0442\u0435\u043c, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0441\u0435\u0439\u0447\u0430\u0441 \u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u044e\u0442, \u043d\u043e \u0441 \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0443\u043c\u0430\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043c\u0435\u0445\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0438 \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043d\u044b\u043c \u0441\u044e\u0436\u0435\u0442\u043e\u043c. \u041f\u043e\u0448\u0430\u0433\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0435 \u0431\u043e\u0438 \u0432 \u0434\u0443\u0445\u0435 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0445\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0430, \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043f\u0440\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0447\u043a\u0430, \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0434\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0432\u043e \u0442\u0435\u0445\u043d\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0439. \u0414\u0430 \u0437\u0434\u0435\u0441\u044c \u0434\u0430\u0436\u0435 \u0434\u0438\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438 \u0441 \u0432\u044b\u0431\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043c \u0432\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0430\u043d\u0442\u043e\u0432 \u043e\u0442\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0430 \u0438 \u0430\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0432\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0430\u043d\u0442\u044b \u043c\u0438\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439 \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c!

Not a problem in itself, but it makes deciding between say +3damage or +1 accuracy item quite difficult.\n\nAnyway, the game is definitely worth the cheap price.

Easy is easy, hard gets hard\n- there's even a storyline to connect the different scenarios, and some rudimentary NPC interaction\n\nCONs:\n- from my observation, not all enemies always exhaust their moves, even when it would be advantageous to do so (I'm assuming here that enemies should always try to attack as much as possible - they have no reason to hold back)\n\nNow, this is not JA2 or even X-Com.  There is no hunting-gathering of new equipment, no manufacture of equipment or items and the progression of scenarios is for the most part linear.\n\nOverall, two thumbs up.\n", "timestamp_created": 1477107732, "timestamp_updated": 1477107732, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26046244": {"recommendationid": "26046244", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008719324", "num_games_owned": 437, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2873, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477007906}, "language": "english", "review": "A very solid, \"Maybe not Warhammer\" game. The fluff isn't bad, but the mechanics are much more original and compelling, in my opinion. There are several major types of enemies (xenos and otherwise) that each feel different and possess different strengths and weaknesses.\n\nThe progression is interesting, and the missions are well-balanced to my findings so far - the only real flaw I'm finding is that with the Mission Completion reward system, you are strongly encouraged to stack movespeed buffs as much as you can, overheating your team constantly and not relying on skills that require you not to be overheated. This allows you to generally outrange and overwatch-spam your enemies to death as they chase you, or to simply outpace them, complete the mission in 60%-80% of the 'par' number of turns, and get a huge bonus to your XP/RP unlocks.\n\nAlso, to give you a perhaps slightly better idea of how things work than the trailers do...\n\nThat massive tree with \"Unlock 1000+ unique talents and gear\" is a general unlock tree for your full force. The Berserker, Paladin, Neptune, and Hydra trees unlock both a new class and gear shared with other classes, which encourages you to branch out into them based on what you plan to do with your squad. For instance, some of the best Heat capacity gear for the Engineer is on the Hydra tree.\n\nProgression along the tech tree, of sorts, allows you to raise the level of skills and equip gear to a Templar who has sufficient level. When they level, they also gain stat points to distribute to Attributes and to Skills; each of them provides a small bonus to either a dice pool (like accuracy) or percentile (like crit chance). The choices you make for unlocks are permanent; choices for assigned gear and abilities are able to be reset and reassigned freely between missions. This means, for instance, you can have a low-level Scout specced in Quickness and Stealth for light weapons, debuffing attacks, and scouting, then as its levels increase you can swap to Strength and Tactics plus the Headshot skill for dealing massive critical damage while still being able to hit. The only thing that has any limitations on use are \"Relics,\" pieces of gear that can only be used by one Templar at a time, some of which are amazing and some of which are \"eh.\"\n\nThe combat system is worth reading a Steam guide on - it's not explained much unless you dig deep, but it's a system that can be loosely described as 'easy to learn, hard to master.' Part of this is that you can't be sure what sort of dice pools you're facing on the enemies, so you can't be certain of when you have 'enough' accuracy to hit reliably and can move on to other stats, as you don't receive any bonus for overshooting an enemy's defense pool that I know of.\n\nIn short, as long as you're comfortable with the faults I'm mentioned and you like Turn-Based Tactics, this game is definitely worth a buy; if you're hesitant but like the genre, it's worth a buy on sale.

Regular updates (so far), give you a reason to come back after you've completed it and the size/depth of the requisition trees (basically what kind of gear is available to each type of troop) means that you're encouraged to keep playing to explore new builds.\n\nYes, it's not as polished or nice-looking as some of its rivals, but I think a true fan of this kind of strategy doesn't care. The mechnical depth more than makes up for it in my opinion. The addition of the 'heat' mechanic makes for some interesting trade-offs at higher difficulties (my poor scouts always end the mission close to exploding from heat) and the armor/block/defense system allows for many different builds. The story has the classic \"grim dark\" slant to it and it borrows a fair bit from other fantasy, but I still found it reasonably engaging. \n\nTLDR; Worth every penny if you like squad/turn-based strategy.

It scratched the same itch as the old Incubation: Time Is Running Out: a small squad of powerful soldiers against a endless flow of mindless, relatively weak enemies.\n\nHowever, it's NOT a spiritual successor to Incubation we all are waiting for :) Templat Battleforce is somewhat simplier than Incubation, because of sameness of enemies: no need to attack from behind or only attack doing enemy's turn with Overwatch. Levels are less like puzzles where you have to get everything right to pass through, because turns limit is not hard (you get bonus for completing a level under turns limit, but you do not lose if you fail to do so).\n\nOn the other hand, many elements will be familiar to anyone who played Incubation: overheating and equipment points which limit how much things a soldier can carry, for example. \n\nUnlike Incubation, soliders don't disappear here if they died during the mission, which makes it less painful to lose one. However, there are also no quicksave/quickload option during the battle (unless you revert to manual save-scumming, which I did at the very end of campaign), which makes longer levels a pain to replay.\n\nOverall, I definitely recommend this game if you like tactic games, and especially if you liked Incubation.\n\nI must also mention that this game is a surprising example of a well-made mobile port. Yes, everything is bigger-than-it-needs-to-be on PC screen, and there are some problems with mouse controls (mostly, scrolling; why was it impossible to implement hold-and-pan in battle, I can't righly imagine).

El jugador no s\u00f3lo se siente atra\u00eddo por la jugabilidad, que es muy alta con varias clases de personajes (lanzallamas, berseker, palad\u00edn, soldado, ingeniero, explorador, comandante, etc) sino por el gran surtido de armamento disponible (rifles cin\u00e9ticos, de plasma, lanzallamas, ca\u00f1ones Gatling, rifles de francotirador, espadas, escudos, pistolas, granadas, etc) y de perks/habilidades (habilidades que buffean a los personajes temporalmente o habilidades innatas).

Lots of classes. Lots of special abilities. Lots of different weapons and armors. Nostalgic \"16bit era\" type story telling.

It felt less like strategic upgrades and more like a chore that everyone needs to be clicked on multiple times between maps. The graphics are ... pretty bad. Usually this isn't an issue for me, but the graphics in this game are exceptionally mediocre. Variety of combat is deceptively slim despite the large range of upgrades.  Even though the classes of marines are wildly different, they don't do much to change your over all tactics. \n\nSolid game. Maybe a 6/10 in my book. Not great, not bad.

I found this game while I was cruising through my queue and pretty much bought it impulsively. How'd that turn out? Surprisingly well. While I haven't gotten too far into the game yet, it did provide me with some inspiration to start a Let's Play of something that wasn't a dating sim. (And the dating sim Let's Play didn't even begin that long ago either.) \n\n[b]Before I get to the review, this is important to note.[/b] The thing about this game that may either attract or repel you is that it is heavily reliant on dice rolls.\nWith each attack, dodge, and parry, many dice get rolled under the hood. This part of the system relies on comparing successes, similar to how contested rolls work in Classic World of Darkness games. Certain dice are more likely to score successes, which are called Strong Dice. The other dice are Standard Dice.\nBlocks, deflections, and critical hits function on a percentile system, where rolling under a certain number blocks damage, automatically deducts half of your armor from the damage incoming (in the case of deflection), or causes a critical hit.\nDamage, however, functions pretty differently than what you'd expect. While I could explain it, it can be pretty complicated mathematically, but the short version is that the attacker has an equal chance to roll any particular number in a given damage range (26-50, for example) and the target has a few factors that reduce damage, some of which function similarly to how one generates damage rolls.\n\n[b]Now that that is out of the way, let's get to the review.[/b]\n\n[h1]REVIEW[/h1]\nI got this game not too long after it came out of Early Access. I went into this blindly, although I had the urge to play some kind of strategy game that wasn't the ones I had been playng for years (various hacks for Shining Force games, Vandal Hearts 1 and 2, a couple others) and wanted to do something involving a sci-fi setting. After looking up some games, Templar Battleforce caught my attention as it was on sale at the time and it had generally positive reviews. So I got it.\n\nIt took me a while to get used to the mechanics of moving around, the order of operations during a turn (AP usage also uses MP, but not vice versa), the concept of heat (well, it makes sense to me at least), and trying (and failing a lot of the time) to master the art of stealth. After learning all of that, the game works pretty solidly. There are times where I do dumb things (I was recording a second video of an Ironman playthrough, but derped for a moment and closed one of my templars in airlock doors and killed him [b]ARGH![/b]), but for some of my riskiest actions, I do well. And it's rewarding when that happens. \n\nUpsides of this game include many diffculty settings to play on (my playthrough is on Normal, the next to easiest setting, although I've been going through a save that's on Brutal, which is three steps above Normal, and there's three more difficulties after Brutal), a pretty good variety of classes to use for the composition of your squad (I'm finding myself tending towards the use of [i]Hail Hydra[/i], who burns every last alien, alien lover, and alien monstrosity they see [b]HERETICS![/b]... Oh, sorry, 40k flashbacks), and some interesting lore.\n\nDownsides of this game include the lack of mod support (which, while the developers are working on it, may be a long shot at getting it to happen), some of the classes perhap feeling underwhelming for a good while until you progress far enough into the game (I'm looking at you, [i]Neptune[/i]), and RNG-sus occasionally laughing in your face and smacking you with massive damage and critical misses (just misses that happen when you need that one hit to either kill the alien or alien lover or to stop them in their tracks [b]PURGE THE HERESY AUGH![/b]... not the 40k spasms again).\n\n[b][i]JANUARY 9 UPDATE[/i][/b]\nI'm nearing what I think is the end of the game, before New Game+. A good number of updates have arrived since the last time I touched this review (as of this writing, Update #62 just came out), and I think I should cover some of those.\n\nA few new enemy types have been introduced. While I have yet to go back through levels with humans and seeing the new human enemy types, I've dealt with a good chunk of new aliens of the type that I wrote of previously. I'm just now coming across the Narvidian menace, so my experience with them is limited enough for me to not really know the difference unless another type of Narvidian is introduced. With that said, the new types are nice to see.\n\nAlong with new enemy types, we've also gained new options for our Templars. Engineers can use equipment specialized for burninating the countryside [b]TROGDORRRRR![/b] (ah, sorry, old Internet things) such as flame turrets and flamer pistols. Hydras can use the special flame tank armor that engineers can use to further increase their fire damage. Berserks can now dual-wield axes to decimate foes (running around with axes that bypass a lot of armor is nice offensively, but not the best defensively). Paladins can use big two-handed shock hammers, which I've found quite fun for smiting a lot of foes.\n\nNeptunes... well, they've been improved in that the Overwatch abilities between Soldiers and Neptunes now differ, and that their weapons tend to have higher armor piercing capability. With that said, they're still a little behind, but they'll be caught up at some point after the enemy updates are done.\n\nIn addition to modifying the units, some map changes have been done too. I have yet to see the new versions of the maps that were affected (or at least, that I notice), but it's good to know. Also, UI changes have been made to make things more convenient.\n\nOverall, I give this game a 9/10 for fans of the genre. It's pretty well-assembled, and updates to the game are free and plentiful. Enemies are just as plentiful as the sand. Also, there's Space Hulk vibes somewhere.

A good balance between nerve wracking and still doable gameplay, as far as I have got.\n\nI have probably made an unfathomable amount of mistakes getting where I have so far, but I have enjoyed my time immensely. Nice one and at a more than reasonable price too. A real no brainer purchase.\n\nEdit: Also rather good on Android as well, as I have found out.

This way, at least you don't need a big computer to run the game).  The story exudes atmosphere, it's basic but well told and the ambiance is well-supported by the graphics. (it will remind you quite a lot of another well-known game universe, though, you see what I mean)...\n\nEverything is well-polished. The user interface is very usable, there are convenient keyboard shortcuts for everything that you'll need to use often and they come handy in most situations, saving time with the trivial things so you can focus on the heart of the game: the turn-by-turn tactic, and the composition, leveling and specialization of a force that will suit your play style.  And there are often several ways to tackle most problems, depending on the composition of your force and your favorite ways to deal with those problems.\n\nThere is a HUGE skill tree, it will take a lot of runs through the game to explore it all. There are many stats/skills/talents/classes that can be combined to produce nearly endless different results. Pick your favorite, make it work (it will take some adjustments here and there), and win the game with it. Rince and repeat.\n\nThe \"normal\" difficulty is a bit on the easy side. You're never really threatened by xenos in this difficulty.

Stylistically it's a mix of WH40K and Incubation, with powered armor and an endless stream of bugs coming to get you.\n\nThe game biggest fault is what some would consider a feature: it loves to throw numbers at you.  One of the very first screens you see is the difficulty screen, which offers 7 different levels, expressing each as a collection of levels and percentages.  If something attacks you, the computer will consider your dodge, block, parry, armor strength, deflection, and \"damage soak\" when determining if and how badly you're hit.  And there's flames, plasma, and bio-poison too.\n\nConsider the character screen: one of the 7 sections on the character sheet reads: \"Melee Defense = 16 strong + 9 standard :: Weapon/Shield Parry (4s) + Warrior (12s) + Armor Evade (0) + Evasion (8) + Parry Bonus(1)\".\n\nAll of these mechanics make the game muddled and uncertain, not deeper.  It's explained in the \"library\", but why bury the player in numbers when it just boils down to \"more is better\"?\n\nThe UI is generally clean, though there are some questionable choices.  For example, you can respec your soldiers at any time, by resetting them to base stats.  It would have been easier to work with \"+\" and \"-\" buttons instead of \"+\" and \"reset\".  The equipment screens have you choose between \"what you can equip now\" and \"what you could equip someday\", which makes it awkward to compare what you have with what's available if you spend \"requisition points\".  (Should flip between \"equip now\" and everything, with the \"available someday\" in a different color scheme.)\n\nThe graphics are decent, though sometimes it's hard to tell which squares are open, which are walls, and which are obstacles that can be fired over but not moved through.\n\nThe separation of \"movement points\" and \"action points\" is an interesting idea.  By encouraging move-then-shoot, you have to think a bit more about how far to move.\n\nThe AoE damage is a bit dodgy, as it's not always clear which cells will be affected by attacks at certain angles.  Some sort of attack overlay would have been useful.\n\nDespite its shortcomings I had fun playing it, so I'm giving it a thumbs-up.\n", "timestamp_created": 1470517399, "timestamp_updated": 1470517399, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.633306", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24659421": {"recommendationid": "24659421", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055194412", "num_games_owned": 136, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 4953, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470333498}, "language": "english", "review": "Bought this game looking for a decent tactical squad combat game.

I usually like turn by turn strategy and tactical games like civilization, fire emblem, shining force, ...\n\nTemplar Batteleforce is a tactical rpg type game which is mostly a sequence of fights with team building in between fights; in the same way your typical fire emblem would be. \n\nIt took me about 40 hours to beat the game for the first time which makes the game an appropriate length in my opinion. It is about 40-ish battles. The game features many difficulty level and probably has a reasonnable replay value. I plan on at least playing the full game a second time, and probably more to explore different team builds.\n\nWhat really did the game for me is how battles are constructed. Essentially the better you \"score\" in a battle, the more experience and RP (essentially money) you get out of the battle. The score is essentially computed depending on how fast you accomplished the objectives, how many ennemie you killed and how many secondary objective (often unknown to you in advance) you accomplished. This gives a sense of urgency in the battles, encourages you to explore, but exploring is dangerous.\n\nAn interesting mechanic in the game is the concept of \"heat points\". Essentially all movement and action a character does makes its suit heat. And when overheated, he starts taking damage, losing ability to perform some types of action, or completely shut down. It is something that usually does not come in the way too much, but it is also something that you can not ignore.\n\nThe team build part of the game is interesting. Essentially the number of \"points\" you can allocate to characters really mean that you can not max-out a character. You have to make hard choices. For instance, you pretty much have to choose between a scout that can scan large portion of the maps and move fast, and a scout that deals massive damage at a distance; you can try a middle ground but it might not be best. Similarly with the engineer, either you get a tact point expert to help take and control tactical points (which are supply point on the map), or you make a battle engineer which buffs your units and is reasonnably useful in a fight. Doing both is a possible but serious compromise,\n\nOne of the problem I have with the team building is that the UI is a bit awkward and it took me almost an entire run through the game before I had a clear enough understanding of the game mechanics to optimize my team carefully. There are a few dimensions to the game system (roll to hit, damage reduction, peircing damage ignore part of the armor, bio-damage do damage in the long run, ...) which are all pretty much independent in the character sheet. It is sometimes hard to see how much point to spend in one aspect. Fortunately, you can \"respec\" your units from scratch between battles, so if you misunderstood the impact of a game mechanic, you can correct your team building mistakes for the next battle.\n\nIn term of difficulty, there are many difficulty levels. I play a lot of tactical games and normal was too easy for me. If you are used to that kind of games, push it one notch up. Though, it seems that at higher level, there is perma death, so... be careful.\n\nI really liked some of the options in the game. Soldiers can use \"overwatch\" to cover some squares of the map and shoot enemie entering the zone. hydras can use napalm to set some squares of the map on fire causing damage to units passing through. Engineers can build turrets to defend some parts of the map. So overall, I feel like as a player, your decision can shape how the skirmish unfols.\n\nOne thing that could be annoying is that the ennemies can pop out of many places with no way for you to know in advance, and they usually play in the turn they appear. So you can get in situation where a unit pops out and deals you damage without much you could have done. (overwatch can be useful there.)\n\nI find that the units you control have a very limitted field of vision. And sometimes, this can be very annoying.\n\nSomething good is that the game developpers are quite responsive. I don't know how long they will be maintaining the game. But for now, they reply on the forum almost immediately. I pointed out a bug that was essentially fixed in a day. They take suggestion.\n\nThe storyline is pretty much irrelevant. I do not feel like you have a clear control of the story nor a clear idea of the lore of the game. It is a fairly straight forward story, with a bit of details if you want to know more. Clearly the story is not the focus of the game. Overall, I feel like it is appropriate for this type of game.\n\nThe graphics are alright. It is a seen from atop game. Nothing fancy, but it works. The graphic style is nice and enjoyable. I appreciated the fact that the style is overall coherent, many smaller games tend to have incoherency in style. But this one is profesionnal.\n\nIn term of sounds, the sfx are appropriate, but the background music sucks. The music is really subpar in this game. One of the track is pretty much a mix of a 8-second track with a 16-second track. The others are not much better. It drove my wife crazy. Fortunately, you can shut the music off and leave the sfx, and play your own music in the back. Makes the game much more enjoyable.\n\nIn summary, is this game perfect ? no. Is it the best tactical game out there? no. Is it fun and enjoyable? Yes. Is it worth its price?

Let's just say, when I play a mission for the first time, I try to be prepared for everything, because it seems like just about anything could happen.\n\nFun tactical concepts like area-based-overwatch, scanners, melee vs range, fog-of-war, heat sinks, turrets, stealth, overheating, ordance, and so much more, all help the 8 different classes feel unique. Even within a class you are offered a lot of meaningful customize between talents, attributes, and equipment. \n\nI held off buying this for a long time, but I'm so glad I took a chance on this one.

Templar Battleforce is a love letter to games like Space Hulk and the early days of X-COM. \n\nYou play as a group of superhuman, genetically enhanced warriors who are protecting a newly colonized section of a vast interstellar empire. Imbued with the ancestoral memories of your templar ancestors, it is your duty to beat back the unreleting hordes (and they really are hordes) of Xenos scum looking to make a meal of you.\n\nGameplay consists of top-down, turn based combat. You command a small squad of templars in a manner very similar to the original X-COM. Unlike your crysalid-bait rookies, (and more like Space Hulk) your templars have tremendously powerful skills and infinite ammo. The downside is that both abilities and weapons generate heat, as does movement, forcing you to pick which targets to kill, but to decide when as well. Overwatching a bridge swarming with xenos may provide excellent fire support, but the resulting weaponsfire may also overheat your critically toatsy templar.\n\nAlso like Space Hulk, you are always completely and totally outnumbered in Templars Battleforce. Enemy reinforcements are infinite, and many battles are fighting advances or retreats against mounting waves of foes. This makes for some surprisingly intense combat, and will definitely give your grey matter a workout. Do you split your forces into two advancing teams to get to the objectives faster? Do you leave one behind at the beacon to wait for your own reinforcements? Do you hold at the beacon until you are at full strength and hope it is sufficient to beat back the mass of xenos that have arrived?\n\nThe game also rewards quick mission times with greater experience, giving incentive to take risks. However, your troops are persistent, as is death. Don't spend your Templars unwisely. \n\nTLDR: \n\nIf you're a fan of Space Hulk, X-Com, or Turn-based Strategy, you can't go wrong with Templars Battleforce.", "timestamp_created": 1462519902, "timestamp_updated": 1462519902, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 28, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.740880", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22703320": {"recommendationid": "22703320", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064548597", "num_games_owned": 305, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 405, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487067164}, "language": "english", "review": "I dont do reviews- but this is worth one.\n\nStraight forward gameplay, but very fun, lots of replay value too, more than one way to do each mission- steath through the shadows, create a literal walking tank with insane damage absorbtion, set all the xeno on fire, multiple times\n\nLots of fun", "timestamp_created": 1461931870, "timestamp_updated": 1461931870, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.536860", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22486978": {"recommendationid": "22486978", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038981973", "num_games_owned": 98, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1362, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475862629}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Todo lo que SpaceHulk debiera haber sido.", "timestamp_created": 1460926543, "timestamp_updated": 1460926543, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22420301": {"recommendationid": "22420301", "author": {"steamid": "76561198272054104", "num_games_owned": 36, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1085, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1458440002}, "language": "english", "review": "Terrific turn based game similar to what you might find from Games Workshop.

Es wird einem in der Char-\u00dcbersicht angezeigt, wie sich Ver\u00e4nderungen am Char auswirken werden und diese Verteilungen k\u00f6nnen zwischen den Missionen komplett ge\u00e4ndert werden. Insgesamt gibt es 7 Klassen aus denen man seine Rekruten w\u00e4hlen kann. \nDer Forschungsbaum hingegen kann nicht reset werden und ist auch nicht in einem Spieldurchgang komplett erforschbar, hier sollte man genau \u00fcberlegen, wof\u00fcr man seine Resourcen verwendet.\nIn den ersten der 6 Schwierigkeitsgrade, stehen gefallene K\u00e4mpfer nach einer Mission wieder zur Verf\u00fcgung, in den h\u00f6heren Schwierigkeitsgraden ist der Tod aber endg\u00fcltig.\n\n\nTechnisch ist das Spiel fehlerfrei und die Klassen sind gut, daran erkennt man, dass die Entwickler das Spiel selbst spielen.

The units under your control, the eponymous Templars, are not entirely dissimilar to WH40k Space Marines, being humans piloting suits of battle armour that augment their abilities.  The twist here is that rather than having a concept like 'gene-seed', a Templar's memories and experiences are passed down through their bloodline across generations.\n\nAnyway, enough of the fluff.  The meat of the game - the tactical battles is competently done; movement and combat is handled via a variation of the time-honoured action point system and works intuitively.  Most missions seem to have a turn goal - completion of the objective within this will bestow extra experience, and this mechanic - coupled with a large sprinkling of risk/reward secondary objectives and tactical points to capture -  can lead to some nail-biting mission climaxes. \n\nThere are excellent customisation options available for your Templars in between missions too, an RPG-lite skill and talent progression system for them to work through and  a very detailed tech tree which you unlock parts of by using the 'resource points' tallied up at the end of each battle.  Contained within the tech tree (which in terms of presentation reminds me of Sword of the Stars 1) are many weapons (some unique), abilites and miscellaneous items all of which allow for many varied takes on a Templar squad's makeup.\n\nGraphically the game is serviceable and has improved with recent patches.  The audio is functional but nothing to write home about.  If I had one niggle it would simply be the relatively minor suggestion that the game lacks a little polish - there are points at which grammatical/spelling errors crop up in some of the story text for example and while I freely acknowledge that these are far from game-breaking, they do nonetheless pull me out of my 'zone' in the game and bring me back to reality with a bump.\n\nAll things considered (including the fantastic support Trese brothers continue to lavish on the game) I would heartilty recommend this title to anyone who enjoys turn-based squad level combat.  It's probably the closest we'll ever get to a genuine turn-based WH40k game, yet it does have its own distinct and well-developed lore.

On normal difficulty, the game will challenge you without becoming overly frustrating. There are a couple of levels that add speical objectives that are difficult to achieve either due to time constraints or due to the sheer amount of enemies that come after you. Others, such as the final battle, put your units in situations that make it very difficult to keep them from being overrun and torn apart before you can get backup to them.\n\nAll of the unit types are useful in combat, which is something that other games do not do well. Your engineers can hold their own, the scouts are death dealing glass cannons that can save your units from ambushes through their ability to scan around corners, and the hand-to-hand units deal and absorb damage with a flare that put a smile on my face. The later units tend to be a little too similar to their predecessors, and tend to have weaknesses that offset their heightened powers to the point that you are better off investing in boosting the older unit types rather than spend precious research points on the newer units.\n\nWhile it might seem that I am being harsh in my review, it is because there were so few flaws in the game that they stand out like proud nails on an otherwise unblemished floor.

I will not go into the gameplay or -mechanics in detail, other reviewers already did that extensively. I bought this game a while ago after noticing it in my steam queue and browsing the reviews (esp. vintoks' and Arkelis' recommendations I found very appealing). Played it for a bit and dropped it for XCOM2. Now I am back at it and that alone should tell you something.\n\n[b]The Good:[/b]\n+ It's been said before, this is the game Space Hulk wanted to be and failed at.\n\n+ The game is very accessible, I consider myself to be a filthy casual when it comes to squad tactics games and I knew my way around pretty quickly without reading a manual. The tutorial is excellent in that regard and tooltips are really helpful. All the powers/actions are adequately explained and those explanations are easily accessible from all the relevant screens.\n\n+ The game mechanics allow for a very good scaling of the difficulty level. I have only played on normal yet (which isn't too much of a challenge even for me *yet*) but I took a peek at other difficulties and the heat distribution of your armor alone requires more planning on your part on the higher ones.\n\n+ I enjoyed the tactical challenges and diverse missions I have encountered so far and I don't miss the hilariously aggravating RNG of XCOM 2 for one second.\n\n+ Customization of your troopers helps identifying and becoming invested with them, as far as you can get invested in something without a personality (your Captain is the sole exception there, as he actually talks) ;).\n\n+ The ability to - at any point between missions - completely and freely respec any character is brilliant and invites you to experiment without having to start a new character. This is (for me) a serious long term enjoyment factor.\n\n+ Same goes for the diverse equipment options you can unlock for your Templars.\n\n+ Various troop specializations give you a wide variety of tactical options (once you unlock the relevant classes in the requisition tree).\n\n+ The story is nice, if not very surprising or unexpected, especially when you are a 40k aficionado like me.\n\n+ The devs. If you read - for example - the negative reviews, you might have noticed, that each one has a calm, objective comment, addressing key gripes of the reviewer where those where recognizable. Frankly I have yet to see something like that anywhere else on Steam (didn\u2019t do ALL the research here tho, so do not make that into a gospel, please). At the same time there is still tweaking and improving of the game going on, months after the official release. And I am not only talking bugfixes, but also new skins and general improvements lesser people would hide behind a DLC.\n\n[b]The Bad:[/b]\nThings I didn't like with the game(play) itself, as opposed to outside appearances (see The Ugly). I am struggling with this a bit, since I pretty obviously enjoyed the game so far. Also I haven't finished it yet, but I wanted to get a positive review out as small games really can use those. So I might come back later and add to this here, but for now, this is what I got. As of now, none of them are anything major, just small annoyances:\n\n- While there are secondary objectives to a mission, I haven't yet found a way to actually discover what they are without stumbling across them accidentally on the map. This clashes with the bonus you get for completing a mission in as little time as possible. That may be intentional, but I'd like the opportunity to decide beforehand if my squad should rather try for secondary objectives or speed. As it stands I don't even positively KNOW if there are secondary objectives at all most of the time (mostly there are, I think, but there seems to be no way to know beforehand) and this leads to a tendency to do a mission twice, once to chart the map and once to actually progress the campaign. Again, this might be intentional, but me no likey.\n\n- There are opportunities to pick up loot from containers during a mission. You can recognize those by the coloring of their adjacent fields. This I discovered accidentally, it would have been nice to get a hint towards this in the tutorial. Also it seems there is a limit on how often this works during one mission, because I had times when I had already picked something up and then further containers I came across didn't give me anything (again a little annoying, because of wasted turns to get there). This too would be nice if it was mentioned somewhere, I haven't found a hint in that regard yet.\n\n- Sometimes the dialogue options between the missions don't make it sufficiently clear that picking them will start a certain mission and close off other options.\n\n\n[b]The Ugly:[/b]\n- If you are looking for eyecandy, this might not be the game for you. The devs did good (and upgraded it noticeably a short while ago), but it can't hold to current standards. And why should it? It is an Indie game, catering to your tactical needs, graphics are a secondary means to that end at best.\n\n- The soundtrack, yeah same. It is ok, but we are pampered by AAA games in that respect. I personally turned it off after a while and have something playing in the background (I hear all the cool kids do that these days anyway).\n\n- No voiced narrative or characters. It's all reading here. That is no problem for me but it bears mentioning.\n\n- The action, hmm. Action and round based strategy? Yes possible (see XCOM(2)), but imo more of the eyecandy category.\n\n[b]tl;dr:[/b] \nI enjoyed (and still enjoy) this game a lot. I regard it as a real gem in the huge dungpile of bad games that Steam can be. If you like turn based squad-tactics you should check it out. If you like a 40k-esque setting,  even more so. If you bought Space Hulk and were disappointed by that, buy this game! Seriously!\n\nThe price tag is immensely reasonable. I have spent more money on some boardgames I put away after one evening.

It's a great game by a great developer. The Trese Brothers, long-time veterans of tabletop tactics games, got their start developing games for smartphones.  They have since produced numerous games exploring multiple genres in a short handful of years. Templar Battleforce represents a return to their stated mission: the creation of high-quality, multi-platform RPGs and Strategy games, supported by strong community involvement and a commitment to lifelong game updates.  All of their games fulfill this vision in some manner, but Templar Battleforce checks every box.  Furthermore, in creating Templar Battleforce, the Trese Brothers have used the lessons learned over their first few years as a fledgling studio to re-envision and re-invent the spirit of one of their earliest games- Templar Assault. It's a great feeling to play a game that is an indie dev's dream made real.\n\n[h1]A Different Grim, Dark Future[/h1]\n\nBefore I discuss gameplay I'd like to address a common criticism of both the Star Traders universe and the Steel universe (Trese Brothers' fantasy setting).  The Trese Brothers have time and again explicitly recognized the Warhammer and WH40K settings as major inspirations for their work.  They also acknowledge many other sources of inspiration for their original settings.  Are the Trese Brothers' settings derivative? Yes. Does that make their settings rip-offs? No.  Point me if you can to a fantasy or spce opera setting in a game that is [i]not[/i] derivative, because I've never seen it.\n\nThe Trese Brothers settings combine common tropes in original and compelling ways, building an internally consistent universe on the foundation of inspiration.  Yes, some devs cut & paste together bits and pieces from popular settings.  The result is a lazy pastiche of improbable bedfellows, without depth or heart.  The Trese Brothers are clearly heavily invested in their settings, and as a result the world-building is unique, coherent, and immersive.\n\n[h1]Every Leviathan Armor is for You, Templar. Which One Will You Make Your Own?[/h1]\n\nGameplay is divided into two primary components: missions and combat, and HQ activities.  The game features features a branching storyline that is tense and dramatic without being overbearing.  You will encounter story dialogue during most missions, but it rarely lasts longer than a handful of sentences.  The combat is top-down and grid-based.  Each Templar has a set number of Action Points (AP) and Movement Points (MP) derived from their base attributes.  The bottom of the screen displays an action hotbar, portrait, and HP and Heat bars for the selected Templar. Actions use AP and generate Heat. If MP is available acting will consume that as well, so it's often prudent to move everyone first and then go back have each one act.  If the Heat meter fills the Templar will not be able to use hotbar abilities. If it overfills they will take damage. Luckily, taking no action dramatically cools the armor.  Cover, line of sight, smart ability use, and overwatch are key elements of success.  The math feels polished, precise, fair, and detailed.  Many maps contain multiple main and secondary objectives; you will rarely play a \"Kill All Enemies\" mission.\n\nBetween missions you manage your squad at the HQ screen. It looks like a base-building interface but there's actually very little of that.  Instead, this is where you choose how to level each character, hire new characters, and requisition new items and abilities.  It's a class-based paradigm, with each class having access to unique skill trees and equipment.  Each level attribute and skill points are distributed manually, allowing for enormous flexibility and diversity.\n\nPerhaps my favorite piece of the HQ experience is the requisition tree.  You earn RP by completing objectives, which you can then spend on an astounding array of global unlocks. Many of the unlocks are class-specific, and the skill-tree paradigm means getting the unlock you want first requires unlocking everything below it.  This is where the game requires careful consideration of your own gameplay style- you can't just unlock everything, you have to choose.  Of course this aspect also adds to the games replay value.\n\n[h1]Thus, my Recommendation...[/h1]\n\nIf you've enjoyed other Trese Brothers games, you will definitely enjoy this one.  And as always the Trese Brothers offer the game attentive and continuous support.  I don't know of any other studio as endlessly committed to improving every product they release.  If you are new to Trese Brothers games, Templar Battleforce is a great place to start your journey.  \n\nI recommend this game for all fans of turn-based squad tactics or of space opera RPGs.  I also recommend this game to almost anyone else, because it both imminently accessible and thoughtfully compelling.\n\n[b]Templar Battleforce: 8/10\nTrese Brothers: 10/10[/b]- an all around class act.\n\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/justreviews] No Drama, Just Reviews [/url]", "timestamp_created": 1455722740, "timestamp_updated": 1455734843, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.666445", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21173258": {"recommendationid": "21173258", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011228805", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 18927, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1444487401}, "language": "danish", "review": "1986", "timestamp_created": 1455354847, "timestamp_updated": 1455354847, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497512", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21167328": {"recommendationid": "21167328", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993432458", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 6480, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1453845966}, "language": "english", "review": "This is basically a dumbed down SpaceHulk with a JRPG sensibility.

That doesn't have to be something bad, but it is in this case. For example UI is lacking. There are tooltips, but they do not have all the information. There are actions your templars can do (attacks, buffs etc.). Tooltips only tell you the cost of the action, but details about what it actually does (for example, that this attack has +x damage) are not available there. You have to right click on the button to get more detailed information. Overal the interface is not very friendly.\n- the game is slow. And I don't mean that my PC is struggling or that I get low FPS - it's just that enemy is taking his time. It's a littley funny, because there is this option to change speed of AI turn to high and it turns off animations.

But even if they die you will get leveled goon ... weaker than a kept alive templar but not bad enough to make the game undoable, thus even in ahrd tiem the game stay fair, and doesnt punch you out of it.\n\n\nSo with all those tool you job is to do your missions will you rush with grenade and melee specialist as a wall of shields axes and swords, will you create deadly cross fire area. or turtle and build turret to wait for equipement reinforcement or simply to wait for the xenoes to crash on you.\n\nAll in all i can only tell you to get this game, its a good turn per turn tactical its addictiv fun and its not too costly.\n\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1454266635, "timestamp_updated": 1454266635, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20833280": {"recommendationid": "20833280", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999507238", "num_games_owned": 272, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 148, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1454736166}, "language": "english", "review": "I am really enjoying this game.

I have even been encouraged to do one by the developers and i genuinely think they take criticism on the nose and act on it. They're good developers, i like them. Though as a disclaimer i use to like the BoE (Battle of Empire) devs too until they screwed up so....Take that with a grain of salt i guess.\n\nAnyway on with the review.\n\nFor starters i'll look at it's aesthetic and how nice it looks, mostly because that's what i see first on the store page. And it can be very, very misleading sometimes, for better or worse. So how does the game look? it looks like a top down 2D strategy game (as you can probably guess). When actually playing the game it looks pretty good, it looks how it does on the store page and even has a few nice little details here and there, it looks nice for what it is. If i had a complaint it would be that i think they could go even further with the details but we're talking tiny, usually not noticable things here, it looks fine as it is.\n\nI couldn't really think of anywhere else to put this so it'll tie the graphics and gameplay segments together. It looks like Warhammer 40K and XCOM had a baby. It shares the gameplay of XCOM (with a top down 2D view) and even the perma death (at normal difficulty and above only, i think). The Warhammer 40K part comes in just from the lore and its general look. This, keep in mind, is not a rip off of either game and it only looks like it was inspired from it. The gameplay itself is your standard squad based turn based strategy game in the same vein as XCOM. Most of it actually feels a lot like the XCOM except with some functional differences. There isn't any cover (sadly) but there are tiles that boost your defense or your weapon range. There is melee combat as well which opens up a few new possibilities. The level design is pretty good as well, layouts are good, squad loadouts and levelling up is also pretty nice, it lets you play how you want for the most part.\n\nAudio is fantastic, i love the soundtrack for the game, the weapons sound a little weak (in my opinion) but other than the plasma rifle's its ok for the most part. Not a lot to say here as its all ok at least and fantastic at best.\n\nBugs, glitches and optimisation. I haven't noticed any bugs, i don't think i've even seen reports about them or any wide spread problems on systems. The optimisation is pretty good. It shouldn't be hard to get a game like this optimised due to how little it actually uses of my system but hey, worth mentioning.\n\nExtra comments or thing's i think should be said: the game is pretty awesome, i finished it in around 20 hours. Will add any more edits or thoughts as time goes on and i play it more.", "timestamp_created": 1454060207, "timestamp_updated": 1459792398, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.481582", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20818361": {"recommendationid": "20818361", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077752876", "num_games_owned": 239, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 838, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497823966}, "language": "english", "review": "Templar Battleforce is a game where you guide your [strike] Space Marines [/strike] Templar Knights  through a campaign figthing against [strike] Tyranids [/strike] xenos, [strike] heretics [/strike] cultists, and... Yes, this is indeed like playing a squad-based Warhammer 40k tactics rpg.\n\nYour Templars are very much like the Space Marines of the Warhammer universe: the enjoyment of slaughter, the willingness to die, and the massive suits of power armor. However, unlike Space Marines, they can be women too. And that's about the only difference. \n\nThe story is mediocre, centering around colonizing a new system and fighting off xenos and cultists, but provides a few intersting moments. It is a squad-based tactics rpg though, so story is put on a backburner to the combat, which is... alright. \n\nCombat is by far the better part of the game. Multiple classes, most of which actually do use different tactics and even feel different. The Soldier/Neptune and Berseker/Paladin basically play the same except that Paladins can heal. Scouts move fast and hit with snipers, Engineers can fortify and build turrets, soldiers overwatch, hydras can create lakes of fire to limit enemy movement. All this makes choosing who you use and how you use them an actual challenge, especially in the missions with tight corridors. \n\nUnfortunately, that really is all there is to say about this game. It's an enjoyable play of squad tactics and provides quite a bit of fun. On the harder difficulties, your squad members die permanently, but you can recruit replacements any time, so that makes it pretty pointless. If you enjoy tactics games, this is worth a playthrough, though probably pick it up on sale rather than full price.\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

One of the best ones in my opinion.\nYou have a RP system, earned for completing deployments. These are used to unlock new classes and upgraded weapons/armour/talents across a massive talent tree. There are 8 classes total including the captain.\nAll templars earn xp, which is used to upgrade stats. They also earn points to apply to talents. A nice and interesting feature is they earn 'wargear' points. The higher this is the better the gear they can equip.\nLoadouts can be changed at any time, none of the weapons/armour/gear cost anything, once they are unlocked you have them.\nThere is a nice variety of enemies trying to separate your limbs and the levels, even though turn based are really tense.\nThere is too many features to list them all here, from the tact points, reinforcements and the excellent overwatch system.\nYou get attached to your customised templars and beg for miracles when one is getting swarmed.\nThe campaign is long, I don't feel like I've even scratched the surface of it. It is full of choices, go this way? Help these people? The game/story is well written and it's an interesting universe the devs have created. The art is actually quite nice, and  you can zoom in close during battles. The sound is well done and it really adds to the atmosphere.\nThe devs are really active, really supporting their games and easy to communicate with.\nHonestly I couldn't recommend this game higher, it's a bargain at it's price.\n\nThe game has complex systems at work in the background but it is really easy to understand and learn.\nDo youself a favour and pick this one up, it's an overlooked gem for sure.", "timestamp_created": 1452210804, "timestamp_updated": 1452211642, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.613504", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20355680": {"recommendationid": "20355680", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004701225", "num_games_owned": 142, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 2867, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484324422}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game.\nThis easily compares to the experience of the SNES Front Mission game. The writing is beautiful space-knight chivalry and politics, and works well into the scenario design. There are many levels of difficulty, no doubt there's one that's right for most any player.\nThe interface design can be a little overbearing with the visual bluntness of it, however it's very intuitive.\n\nThis is a game with somewhat complicated mechanics going on in the statistics, and it also fully explains all of them. Contrasting this with many other games that leave the players in the dark about finer points for the sake of appearing simple, this game spells out all its rules for the player in the help area.\n\nThe tactical play is solid. Templars have battle armor that generates heat with every move and action, and dissipates every turn. They take damage from overheating and lose access to some abilities, so this is literally a set of rules where \"every move counts\".\n\nThere may be a nuance or two that leave something to be desired for some people. The permadeath is relatively gentle and squishy - new recruits are free and infinite outside of battle, come at a percentage of captain level (depending on difficulty setting), and can be respec'd and redesigned freely - so you never really \"lose\" a soldier, just some negligible amounts of experience(perhaps less negligible on harder settings). The soldiers in your roster are just ready-to-deploy sets of specs and loadouts so you don't have to use the random stuff on new recruits in battle(though that'd be an interesting alternate way to play).\n\nOne might also say that some of the 8 soldier classes are too similar. Three of them are just gunners - gunners that are mostly offensive, gunners that are strictly offensive and use flame attacks(though the fire trails can be defensive), and gunners that emphasize overwatch, grenades and buffs. Many of the classes have limited gear options and the choice isn't about how you build that class, just using it or not (gee, do I want my guy that generates a lot of heat to have gear granting greater max heat? yeah probably). Other classes have a big variety of useful abilities and it pays to have two of them that are specialized differently, so it feels like some of the classes got the short end of the design effort.\n\nDespite this I do NOT think the tactical decision making in the game leaves anything to be desired, the choices all impact the game. I find myself agonizing over the simplest stat growth choices.\n\nAnyway, this game has far exceeded expectations, and I've played my share of XCom, FFT, and etc. I think it will please anyone who doesn't have strong preferences about the nuances of the genre, and rather is open to the design choices of individual games.

TBF is much more focused and mostly you aren't going to roam freely around the maps, but it's not a bad thing, since it makes the gaming experience more compact and probably more enjoyable for the average gamer. (In reality you can explore the maps as you wish, but it's dangerous because xenos are costantly spawning and there's a turn limit for XP bonus, if you're trying to obtain it).\nTactical combat and character development are excellent as in HoS, while the tech tree adds a layer of complexity, that makes up for the more linear structure of the game. Feeling of progression is also faster, and so the general pace of the game.\nI can't decide which one I like more, it really depends if you prefer a fantasy or a sci-fi setting, and I like them both.\n\nPros:\n\n+ better graphics and sounds than in HoS\n+ more focused mission-based gameplay helps keeping a good pace\n+ missions are not repetitive, objectives are varied and you need different approaches\n+ more character types, with lots of possibilities for talent/gear customization\n+ extensive tech tree that makes talent choice much less obvious than in HoS\n\n(Very minor) Cons:\n\n- as in HoS, music is mainly made of loops; there are some brilliant tunes among the lot, but also some that you'd wish to skip (but you can't, unless you exit the mission and reload)  (you can check my Extended Soundtrack mod if you wish, look for it in the Steam forum)\n- unlike in HoS, the story isn't a very important part of the game, even if it shares the setting and the world lore of other games by the same developer (the Star Traders series).\n- a bit shorter than HoS\n\nOverall the game is great, and you should play it if you like turn based combat. Don't expect XCOM (I mean the old one), here there's a story that enfolds, and missions are pre-scripted. It's very rare that I keep playing a game after I've finished it once, and it happened with this one.\n\nI also have to say that some of the few negative reviews insist on the fact that it's a mobile port or that it has a mobile feel, and have put really little time in actually playing the game. I've never played a game on a mobile device so I can't judge, all I know is that if you focus on the game's qualities you shouldn't really care if it's a port or not.", "timestamp_created": 1452066351, "timestamp_updated": 1458735054, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.546828", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20308061": {"recommendationid": "20308061", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023750860", "num_games_owned": 266, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 494, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479619258}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is well worth the price, and even more so if on sale.\n\nAs cheesy as the word Battleforce can be, the title is quite engaging and fun for those that enjoy strategy and turn based games. \nA dice system akin to WH40K and DnD is used to calculate combat values and statistics, while gameplay wise it performs similar to xcom on a grid system.

There is more or less 40 missions. You usually need 10 to 20 turns to finish missions. (I would say 20 min to 1h30 per mission?)\n\nThere is 8 distinct kinds of soldiers (captain, scout, engineer, paladin, berserk, etc...) You chose how they progress after each mission : skills points and attributes points, how you equip them and which talents you learn or improve, depending on soldier's class. (For example: strike harder with blade or gun, strong short range shooting or long range, personal or mass boost -defensive or offensive-, more movement points, cover, radar, healing, attacks with penalties for ennemies, turrets, more abilities uses, capture, repair, etc...)\nBefore each mission, you can freely re-attribute skills points, attributes points and talents points, to modify you soldiers as you need.\nThere is a big development's tree used to chose which classes you will improve, which gears and abilities you will unlock, and which items you will be able to use. There is a lot of separate branches, and you cannot reset this tree, so your \"battleforce\" really depends on it.\nYou can entirely  create and chose which soldiers you use during missions, even if sometimes some soldiers or some classes are forced on. All soldiers progress during the game, even if soldiers you use a lot progress faster.\n\nThere is a \"capture tactical points\" mechanism in many levels. With tactical points, you can deploy new sodiers in mission, get new items to help you, and you usually want to protect it. It's not the core of the game (you don't do so many captures or deployments), but it's definitely a big part of the gameplay.\n\nThere is a totally black \"fog of war\", so you have to explore and discover maps, ennemies and objectives.\nThere is sometimes secondary objectives (places to go) on maps to get more xp, but usually you don't know if there are secondary objectives in a mission, and you don't know where it is.\nThe game push the player to move quickly and to kill a lot. The less you need turns to beat a mission (and the more you kill per turn), the more you receive XP.\nThere is small randomness in ennemies'creation.\nThere is no randomness for maps. So, if you retry a level, you will know what to do and where to go.\n\nSometimes (not too many), you have to do some choices, so the order of mission will change... and you can't do all missions in one playthrough.\nWhen you finish the game, you can start again with your team and stronger ennemies to continue your progress.\nThe game saves automatically every turn. (So if you quit during a turn, you will have to start again. It can be useful if you did a bad move.) You can never save by yourself. During a mission, or at the end of a mission, you can restart the mission. (Except for ironman mode.)\n\nThe combat system is relatively complex, but there is an in-game \"library\" to briefly explain all concepts... if you want understand. There is some tutorials missions, to explain really basic stuff.\nThere is randomness during fights. Even if you can definitely influence it, and you can probably deal with it, the difference between a strong critical hit and a dodged one is obviously big.\nYou have to deal with a \"heat\" mechanism which inflicts damage if you do too many actions every turns.\n\nThere is a story and a universe around the game. You learn it mainly by talking with 2 or 3 NPC between missions. (You can skip it.)\n\n\n[b]Personal opinion[/b]\n\nI like turn-based games, and I enjoyed this one. It was fun to play, to find the best solution, to improve my soldiers, to discover the game. I liked different kind of soldiers and different abilities. Even if it's \"simple\", I think that the team successfully diversify missions. There is a lot of interesting soldiers, talents, gears and items, and the game is still well-balanced.\nI liked to be able to play an entire mission in small game's session... and to know the length of a mission before I start it, based on the turns goal.\n\nPersonnally, I'm not fan of all mechanisms. (If I want more xp, I have to play fast rather than safe... I don't like the fog of war most of the time, because for some level you need to know the map to make best tactical decisions... The development's tree is big, with a lot of branches, so you cannot enjoy all classes during a playthrough, it's a little bit sad... You have to play always with same soldiers if you want the best progress for them, so you can't easily try all of them... It seems that the best way to play is to focus on some abilities and to avoid overheating, so you don't have enough talents points and heat to really use all interesting talents during fight.) But it's just details! The game is well crafted, the small team behind the game seems to be nice, so I can easily recommand this game, if you like this kind of game and if you liked what you saw in videos and screenshots.\n\nDefinitely, it's for people who like turn-based tactical games.", "timestamp_created": 1451650241, "timestamp_updated": 1451651101, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20162877": {"recommendationid": "20162877", "author": {"steamid": "76561198102177223", "num_games_owned": 63, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 898, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510593439}, "language": "english", "review": "I originally picked this game up just because it was a turn based strategy game, and I love games that reming me of the many hours I put into Fire Emblem.\n\nSound: My first instinct here is to say that it has an 8-bit or 16-bit feel. Because the theme, it has space, steampunk, and a bit medieval history. It blends all the themes and their sounds, and makes for a very nice feel to add to the game.\n\nGraphics: This game could have been on the old Nintendo or Sega systems back in the 90's. For the younger generation, this game is probably awful looking, but I just love it. The nostalgia of playing a game that could have been a game  from my youth is just great. The colors of the Templars and the other factions are simple but feel right. The templars are a rustic metal, while the Xeno seem like they're straight out of a circuit board.\n\nGameplay: Plays like most tactical strategies, you can only move so much each round and attack. This game takes a different kind of system, where if you attack before moving, your AP gets removed from your movement as well. Each of the different classes have armor and weapons you can equip between chapters. But the catch is you have to use the Requisition tree to unlock them. It also is where you unlock the more advanced units. This makes each playthrough interesting as you cannot really unlock all of the features in each playthrough. \n\nReplay Value: I am still working on my first campaign, but I already see the skill trees and talents that I messed up. A scout doesn't need much melee points, so focus on his ranged skills. I could play this a hundred times, and might just possibly do so.\n\nStory: The story so far seems a bit confusing, but it does seem in depth enough. It has lore and backstory, much like you'd get out of Elder Scrolls or Warcraft. I feel that as the game develops you will get more details to make the reason you're in this fight more obvious.\n\nOpinion: Overall, I'd give this game an 8/10. It has given me something to sit down and enjoy after a long day. I can play a level or two and then move onto something else. I can pick it back up the next day, and not feel like I've lost anything. I managed to pick it up on sale, but the standard price for the game is not bad for an indie game. I definitely say if you like tactical strategies, Fire Emblem, or just a general history buff, Templar Battleforce has something for you.\n\n*Edit: I would like to add that I love that the team is putting time into making the game look and run better than the initial launch.

This lovely little game first caught my eye when I was trolling around the internet looking for video games that gave me the ability to play customizable soldiers clad in epic battle armor. This little gem caught my eyes and I've been hooked ever since.\n\nIn Templar Battleforce, you play an elite force of genetically modified humans who are capable of cognizant recall of their ancestor's memories. They, along with a convoy of more \"all natural\" human beings have fled the core of the galaxy to seek their fortunes, and survival, after an epic war ravaged their homeworlds in a past war. They come under attack during their exodus and are forced to make landfall on a set of desert worlds. From here, the story of the Templars truly begins.\n\nIn this game, you will control a customizable taskforce of Templar warriors. Your force is broken down into multiple different unit types: Your \"Blade Class\" Captain (Basically, the proper Player Character), Soldiers, Scouts, Engineers, Hydras (Flamethrower equipped heavy infantry), Neptunes (Autocannon/HMG equipped heavy infantry), Paladins and Berzerkers. Each class evolves as you spend a limited pool of requsition points to unlock new abilities, equipment, and options for your units.\n\nThe Requisition Tree deserves special mention because of how in depth it is. Every class has no less than three branches they can develope along, and given the relative rarity of the requisition as a resource, you will have to carefully mold your taskforce, selecting which classes and which abilities you desire to define your Templars with. Will you try for a generalist approach, taking each class and combining the smaller number of individual powers to create a greater sum than the whole? Will you focus on one or two classes, creating an army that is solid because of the uniform excellence of a Templar unit type? Will you stride into the battle with guns blazing, Neptunes holding the fort and laying down massive walls of firepower while the Soldiers press ahead and annhilating xeno scum with plasma blasters? Will you take up axe and sword, forming mighty shield walls while augmenting and healing your brothers and sisters in the middle of cyclone of melee combat? The choice is yours, and if you play the campaign through, New Game Plus will reward you for your diligence and victories in the face of defeat.\n\nThe campaign consists of a series of linked missions. This is where the meat of the gameplay is. Each mission will have its own objectives and peculiarities. While they tend to follow a fairly similar layout from one mission to the next (Kill enemies, survive against timers, take strategic points), each mission does in fact have its own peculiarities. You will cleanse infested landscapes with mighty flamethrowers, you will assault into alien ships to plant bombs in the core of the vessels, you will retreat through canyons and pver bridges while burning the earth during your retreat, you will investigate derelict space hulls, you will save desperate people from the middle of nightmarish scenarios, and you will secure cities against invading forces. Each of this mission types will come with their own peculiarities, their own specifics in terms of victory objectives, and each will have a larger place in the game's overarching plot. So, while the missions will have similar formulas, you will never truly play the same fight twice.\n\nThe mechanics on the field are rather simple at the end of the day. You have a topdown isometric perspective, wherein you command your units on a tactical grid. Movement points, action points, special attacks and abilities, unique battlefield requisition, and more will all be at your disposal. Each character is commanded individually, giving you the ability to maneuver your forces and utilize your strengths in strategic coordination. Soldiers can lay down fields of cover fire while your melee units advance, meanwhile your scouts move up ahead to find enemies and peg them with high powered sniper rifles or venomous needlers. Cap it off with your engineers setting up turrets to organize a defensive peremiter for your Neptune to hold with his suppressive fire so your strike force can advance deeper into enemy territory, and you'll find victory in your sights. Or do it another way. If you're familiar with tactical turn based squad games, then you will be right at home with Battleforce Templar, no matter your preference for command.\n\nAll of this is topped off with a world full of lore and personality that is revealed through the journal of your Captain and his/her interactions with the various NPCs you will meet in both missions and peaceful zones between campaigns.\n\nLikewise, the music  tracks to this game, while somewhat limited in number, definitely set the tone for the missions. Each soundtrack is crafted with an emotional theme in mind, ranging from an uplifting ballad of defiant action against the enemy to stress inducing choruses that are played when the mission's stakes are high and the price of failure is higher.\n\nFinally, the developer(s) for this game are actively improving upon their creation all of the time. Since I first obtained Templar Battleforce, there have been at least three full mini campaigns introduced, several revisions and additions to the Requisition Tree, expanded lore entries and dialogue options, expansions to enemy unit types, and a multitude of bug fixes, weapon rebalances, and class expansions. This is clearly a labor of incredible love from a dedicated company that wants to deliver the best experience possible to their customer base without shelving the cost of expanded content on their fans. They're doing this old school, and they're doing this right.\n\nIf you are a fan of Tactical Turn Based Strategfy games and love to support developers who put their player base first, this game comes HIGHLY recommended.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1449524774, "timestamp_updated": 1449524774, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527559", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19550991": {"recommendationid": "19550991", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009331989", "num_games_owned": 274, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 4100, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506133457}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm a pretty big fan of their Android game Templar Assualt, so I wasn't too sure about buying this as I thought it would be more of the same.

I think that there are a few things that are off, but it's really enjoyable to play. I also respect that there have been so many patches and additions. There are a couple things that are kinda like...what? otherwise a very good game.\n\nIt's tactical and turn based. It's heavily reminiscent of Warhammer 40K so if you're a fan of that you might like this, or hate it depending on how much you like warhammer. The plot is simple. you're a templar dood who takes command of a squad. You're trying to locate the source of xeno scum and wipe them out, essentially.\n\nThe turn based combat seems a little weird at first, but once you understand how it works it can work pretty well. You spend AP by doing actions or you spend move points by moving. if you move first, you don't spend action points, but if you shoot first you spend move points. Like if you have 6 move and action points. You move 3 spaces and then shoot for 3 action points. You would have 3 action points and no move points left. This means it's often better to stand firm and fire a whole bunch and encourages stationary combat. Which is good as well because the enemy is mostly melee. There are defintiely ranged enemies too though and there aren't just xenos, but they are the main enemy.\n\nThere's also a 'heat' system where if you take too many actions your templar can overheat and take damage. This restricts you from shooting and moving too much. \n\nI feel as though the 'requisition' system is neat too, but kinda makes me spread too thin. It's better to focus on a few classes, like 4 of them than to try and get them all. I also don't like that there is soldier and then heavy weapons because they function essentially the same. Paladin and berserker are similar too, but they have the distinction of being a healer and a pure melee which is nice, but there could be more variety in them.\n\nThe other classes are pretty varied though and quite fun to mess with. I like that engineers can lay turrets or specialize in capturing. Scouts can kite or be big hitters and armor penetrators or dedicated stealth scouts. Stealth works pretty uniquely too since it's not just 'turn invisible now you're invisible' but that you increase your stealth and stealth levels make you harder to detect. The only downside I can see is it's hard to tell if your guy is actually 'stealthed' since stealth levels reduce the range the enemy can detect you at. You kinda gotta manually do it?\n\n\nAnyway I would definitely recommend the game. I like the game, the devs seem responsive in fixing bugs and adding in some content and making the game as a whole better. Some real love was put into the game and it makes the game even better as a result.

Lot's of content, good class and progression system, flexible difficulty settings, rich back story, runs smoothly to boot.\n\nIf I had to describe this game in one word it would be: functional. There's no beautiful art or pretty effects, but what's is there gets the job done. The core gameplay is solid and the game runs smoothly, which to me is the most important thing a game has to get right before anything else.\n\nGameplay consists of turn based battles where you command a squad of space-marine-esque warriors called Templars. They come in various classes which gives them access to different abilities. The combat system can be a bit dense if you try to understand everything at once, but the game does a decent job off telling you what you need to know at any given time and if you really want to dig into the system there is a \"Library\" section that explains the game rules in detail. One thing I esspecially appreaciate about the interface is: tooltips, tooltips everywhere. Don't know what a stat does, just hover over it and a tooltip will appear and tell you what it feeds into, how likely am I to kill that alien?, hover over it and a tooltip will pop up giving you hit percentages and average damage.\n\nIn a game with a dense rule set like this I'm thankful that the devs made sure I could always quickly access enough information to make a decision and there are plenty of decisions to be made, both in and out of mission. Character progression consists of assigning points to their base stats, their special abilities(called talents) and giving them better gear. Below this is a requisition tree where you spend a requisition points to unlock new talents and equipment for your characters. I think this tree is very well planned out as it offers multiple ways to specialise your character classes, and many pieces of equipment can be used by more than one class, thus you can expand your options for other classes even as you level up only one. The limited amount of talent points each character gets means that you will inevitably create multiple characters of the same class and specialise them differently. For example: the scount class can be used as a fast stealth unit, or speced to be a high damage sniper.\n\nThe missions themselves are varied enough to be interesting. Most of the objectives consist of finding a thing or getting your entire squad to a certain place, but the map design and narrative keep this from getting boring. The game also provides a variety of difficulty settings from easy to the hardcore-permadeth-single-autosave difficulty for the ultra masochist. I have not finished the game yet but 18 hours in it looks like there's still plenty more content.\n\nOn the surface the game lore feels like it draws a lot of influence from Warhammer 40k, but I feel that it ultimately stands on it's own. Yes you have a force of elite warriors in mech-suits, yes you have a race of completely unsympathetic biological killing machines, yes you have cultists working to undermine humanity from within, but it's not like WH40k has a monopoly on these tropes and Templar Battleforce puts enough of it's own spin on them to keep things interesting. I find the concept of the Templar Lineage particularly fascinating.\n\nThe game's story is mostly delivered through text in \"cutscenes\" and through conversations in \"secure areas\"(missions where you can just walk around and talk to NPCs). This is fine if you don't mind reading text and enduring a little low budget storytelling. I think the devs did a decent job of breaking up the text and avoiding gratuitous exposition dumps, but your mileage may vary. If you really don't care for the story you can quickly skip over the text anyway.\n\nMy opinion on this game is summed up in the TLDR.

You like sci-fi? You like turn-based TACTICAL (yess, all caps!) games? You like RPGs with deep customization of characters and squad? You like story-driven scenarios with lots of objectives? You like to have access to the mechanics of the rules? You like all of the above except the sci-fi genre (you prefer goblins and wizards, is that it?)?\n\nWell you have to at LEAST read on.\n\nI've only played 2 missions (2 times the first one, 1 time the second), and let me tell you this : this game is serious stuff!  Now you might say ''Pfff, you barely played the game, how can I give credit to your review?''. Because just browsing through the interface, options, library, menus, tech trees, character sheets, etc., you'll get the feeling you know you like to have from this kind of game. The feeling of satisfaction. The feeling of devotion and attention to details from the devs.  The feeling that you'll spend quality time playing the game. The feeling that your decisions in-game actually matter.  And... the feeling that you won't see much of your family and friends for the next few weeks!\n\nHonestly, I know nothing from the Star Traders universe, but I'm familiar with Warhammer 40k and StarCraft with their space marines. The Templars in this game hits the same chords : who doesn't like hulking machines decked-out in heavy weaponry ready to fire at every alien shenanigans they come by? On a more serious note : the Templars are really well done and diverse.  The lore behind them is also very interesting, and I love how it reflects into actual character customization. In this game, you can respec your Templars at-will between each mission, so you'll never be locked in your choices of character upgrades.  It lets you try different skills without the drawback of having to lvl another character.\n\nWhat I really like is that information is not hidden. If you haven't noticed yet, I like to look at menus, tooltips and interfaces a lot because to me, these are the things that make or brake games like that.  And the ones found in this game are simple, easy to use and easy to know what is what.  From the font, to the colors used to identify different rolls, to its sound effects, you simply cannot have difficulties navigating through your character sheet, assigning orders and planning your moves.\n\nNow to actual gameplay and features. After only 2 missions in, I see the enormous amount of tactical and strategic plays you'll have to make to succeed in this game.  From using the terrain to your advantage, to capturing Tactical Points to get more reinforcement and supplies, while having to carry out your mission in a timely fashion, this game offers a deep experience.  It let's you take your time to plan out your strategy. Turn by turn, yes, but also before deploying into the actual mission.  You have to select your gear, your talents, your skills, etc.  Because you want to succeed, yes. But you also want to survive.\n\nTemplar Battleforce offers a wide selection of game difficulties that will satisfy casual to semi-hardcore to full hardcore players.  Permanent death not your cup of tea? Play easy or normal, where your Templars carry on to other missions if you succeed even if they were defeated in battle.  You like to play with permanent death but don't want to lose everything if you screw up? Demanding and Hard difficulties let you abort and retry your missions without penalty, but you can chose to carry on and accept the death of characters if you succeed the mission.  Then there are harder game modes where decisions are final.  You died? Sorry pal, you are dead.  No turning back.\n\nAnd finally, the amazing support of the devs.  The devs are real soldiers.  They have placed an Overwatch over their game.  As soon as you ask a question.. BAM! an answer comes right away.  They never seem to overheat.  And they are really dedicated to implement player suggestions into the game.  Browse through the community hub and you'll see. They put out guides, they ask for game files to track stats, they actively participate in discussions, they give interviews and are clear about the future of the game (no DLC), and most importantly, they update the game frequently. The game is even available on mobile platforms and they plan to share saved files eventually.\n\nSo by all means, if you hesitate about buying this game, you shouldn't. If you are into tactical turn/squad-based games, you will like it.

Enemies and Templars alike have a wide range of interesting talents to select from, none of which have struck me as redundant so far. The tech tree is expansive and detailed, with missions providing enough unlock points to facilitate experimentation while you find the layout that works best for you. The Templars also feature a system akin to genetic memory that allows for full respec between missions. While flavourful, this also allows you to experiment with a variety of builds without having to worry about making your units suboptimal in the later game or having to maintain more copies of each class than you need.\n\nThe developers clearly love their creation and have demonstrated a level of interactivity, responsiveness and support that I find very impressive.\n\nIf you like the genre, I absolutely recommend this game.", "timestamp_created": 1446593268, "timestamp_updated": 1446593268, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.646127", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18849870": {"recommendationid": "18849870", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052764796", "num_games_owned": 96, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3745, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1447080086}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm having trouble putting this one down!

Gameplay wise, it's crisp, smooth, and responsive, although the game seems built for a tablet screen (much like The Banner Saga). The squad building aspect is quite appealing, with several different classes, each with their own unique skills and equipment restrictions. \n\nMissions are a mixed bag, ranging from \"Take and Hold\" types to \"Race Against the Clock\", and everything in between. Difficulty is fairly equal, with a few missions harder than others. Perma-death of your squaddies isn't an issue unless you're playing on Demanding difficulty or higher, which I heartily recommend for the adrenaline rush.\n\nAll in all, after buying several games recently and having my expectations dashed and my wallet drained, Templar Battleforce leaves me satisfied and wanting more. Consistent updates after launch make this a gem to buy and play, plus it supports indie development.\n\n***EDIT: February 26th, 2016***\n\nOh man. I wish you could give this game multiple recommendations, and here's why.\n\nAfter several months since I bought this game, the devs have done consistent tweaks and updates since then. And after some digging, I've discovered that the Trese Brothers have done this with not only Templar Battleforce, but also with their other titles! The consistent post-release updates have really made this game shine in my opinion, with more customization options, a UI overhaul, and even rebalancing and the addition of new enemy types being the tip of the iceberg in what the devs have added since I made my review. \n\nWith more and more \"games\" (and I use the term loosely) not even making it out of early access, Templar Batteforce is still a shining example of what makes indie development great.

Mechanically everything works, but I don't find anything compelling in this game to, say, the game's from the UFO series, or even XCOM EU (and I hate that game). Or almost any other RPG tactical. Combat is pretty tame. You've got different points that award increased attack and defense to whoever holds them. A supply system that rewards you for holding tactical points with more characters on the field. Additionally, classes, talents, skills, etc which can be used to differentiate the different characters. There's also an RP upgrade system where you use points to unlock equipment, skills, etc. Also, the AI seems fairly straightforward so far, no twists, but it was early in the game (I doubt I'll have anything more to say on that). Together, it is solid, but if you search through most tactical games, you'll find most have a good chunk of the above in one form or another. However the dev's are still working on the game and we could see mechanical improvements. And besides that I hear what you're saying, \"But dark, that's no reason to rate the game 2 out of 5, it should be at least a 3 out of 5 for these reasons!\"\n\nWell, my astute audience, my main issue is with the story. Some other reviewers are going, \"OMG, the story is brilliant! Buy the game!\" Obviously I disagree. For starters, I find the very idea of \"Genetic memory\" to be laughable. Might as well go, \"Magic\" (I'm doing jazz hands, fyi). But I gave the game a chance and set aside how silly that concept is. No, despite that, my main issue is that the dev's seem to be wishy washy about this \"Genetic memory\" and memory of the ancestors thing. In one scene, for instance, our main character 'knows' that a big baddy will come through a gate and so tells everyone in the party that it will occur. My immediate response was, \"Wait, what?\" At one point or another every person in your party would've had an ancestor that probably witnessed this sort of event so why the devil is our protagonist saying that? Are they just that kind of annoying a**hat? Wouldn't it make more sense to just do ancestoral flashbacks that way we get the info and it can be cool at the same time (show vs tell, devs)? Ugh, anywho, when the big bad does pop out what it is has to be explained to the protagonist via helper helpington (or reddish shield guy if you prefer). This isn't to mention how annoying it is when we're told a whole bunch of history to things that our character was indirectly a witness to.\n\nAnd I can hear the buzz of the annoying uncritical fanboys, \"But we get to make chhhooooiiiccccessss!\" Okay, okay, sure, but the game has essentially murdered my interest in it at this point with these crimes against story telling and no amount of 'choice' makes up for that. Especially since this isn't the first game to do \"You've got choices now!\" Bland emotionless characters aren't helping either (at least at this point). Of course, the ultimate sin is that we're 'told' about this lineage. I don't see why we couldn't have an overarching family/lineage tree in the UI somewhere to give us all of the backstory. Even give all of those non-descript recruits a place in that tree. Seems like a better idea than what is currently in game. I imagine there should even be a few family feuds in there. This \"Genetic memory\" thing could be intriquing if done right, as it is, its a snore fest with no mechanical traction to get us anywhere to the more interesting points.\n\nAnywho, I'm certain a solid chunk of peeps are all going, \"Pft, I don't care about any of that,\" or \"You're totally missing the point, X and Y and Z happens!\" To the first, okay, but there are people that do. To the second, I don't really care. At this point the game has failed from a story telling perspective and in major unforgivable ways. I came in wanting to see what would transpire and now I no longer do. The writing up to this point is crap and the mechanics weren't enough to tide me over until X or Y or Z.

The graphics are obviously very rough, but it does nothing to reduce the charm of this spectacular game.\n\nRight after Xenonauts (the master of all indie turn-based tactical games on steam which you MUST have), this is probably the best.\n\n\nAlso, tip: Use only scouts. They're the best, especially in the end-game.\nEDIT: Scratch that, use only neptunes with high pen. weaponry and scouts.

Have thoroughly enjoyed playing 23+ hours so far and I think I'm about halfway through. Bottom line, if you're into squad based combat games, and don't need fancy graphics, this game is for you. It's kind of like XCOM but without the stragteic base management, instead the strategic management is more about spending your xp wisely, equipping your troops correctly, and unlocking the parts of the trees that your soldiers need to upgrade gear/abilities.\n\nI hope these guys come out with an expansion, or another game. They have got everything right from the actual gameplay perspective, all they need is a little more polish on the graphics (better and more varied animations, a bit better UI) and sounds, but those are just a matter of getting better assets, not a fundablement problem with the game.\n\nGood\n* Writing is crisp and impactful without delivering walls of text. You also don't have to read pages of exposition up front, the game drops you in the middle of the action and the story without the need to explain everything up front. If you don't mind learning-as-you-go (I really enjoy it) then it's a great experience.\n* Excellent balance of difficulty, fun, and excitement. I've felt challenged on most levels (occasionally I breeze through one), and even lost a few levels.\n* The equipment and leveling up systems are great. You unlock gear through a requistion process, but you don't buy individual pieces, instead you can then assign it to any soldier. When you level up you get to assign 2 different and independent stats while leveling a talent which are the abilities you can use in game.\n* The soldiers classes feel /very/ different from each other and there are about 10 of them. Even small loadout changes can really flavor how they behave and operate on the battlefield. You also have a lot of choices on how you want to mix/match meele/ranged.\n* The game doesn't reward you for \"farming\" during the mission at all. Get in, get the job done as quickly as possible, and keep your soldiers alive. You get extra xp and requsition points for doing the right thing (not for sitting at a spawn and camping).\n* The in-mission replenishment system is great. You defend control points and those give you supply points which you can use to purchase stuff like medpacks. These control points aren't in every map, and generally if there are any you have to bring an Engineer.\n* The mission flavors are great. I always feel like I'm doing something new. They do a great job of mixing up \"defense, escort, push, speed, explore\" kind of maps. I have actually picked out different flavors of teams based on that. The size of your team also changes, and there are occasionally NPCs that come with you (which can be a fun way to play with a class you haven't unlocked through the requisition system already).\n* The mechanics of the game are great, and there's a lot of stuff in the character page that helps explain stuff. I would comment that it's kind of hard to get a feel for if you're pumping a stat too hard. IT would be nice to see the dice rolls and calculations which drive the game so that you could get a better idea if you've put way too many points into accuracy.\n\nBad\n* The sound effects are pretty terrible. The music is OKay, but the gunshots and alien damage noises are really repetitive and often times I have a hard time telling what they are suppose to be.\n* There is no \"walk range\" indicator that shows you what tiles you can move to.

Thankfully did not enounter any bugs on my first play through (demanding difficulty). Balance could use some improvement. None of the maps felt particularly challenging, so much as occasionally tedious. Some levels are near impossible to complete in the target number of turns (if you approach them with no prior knowledge) and can spiral into runaway heat as you search for the right order to activate switches. Once know the correct path to take for routing power / unlocking doors, they are easy. These sequence should really be randomized and the maps balanced accordingly. Other than that, most maps can generally be rushed in half the number of target turns or less. MP is the single most important attribute. Buffed scouts with 12+ MP will wreck many maps. Beat the end boss in 7 turns on first try (target 30)... felt like the easiest map in the game. RNG can be silly with the map initialization. Sometimes you spawn a single low level creature on first turn, other times you spawn a whole group of powerful mobs, which makes the idea of playing on Ironman completely unappealing. Haven't tried to replay as a second lineage.

It is a bit light on the roleplaying aspect but the action is amazing and has a ruleset that blows away the simple but punishing nature of games like the newest XCom's hit/miss mechanics. You will not find frustration by making the right decisions just to have your men screw up your tactical approach. But failure will come with bad choices or just a lack of battlefield visibility that you did not get, aka you can feel good that your loss is your fault in this game and not the dice. I have put together a couple of lists of things you can do in this game and why it is cool.\n\nBefore I get into the details, I'll cut straight to the chase with some stuff that wow'ed me:\n\n[list]\n    [*]A scout who does not have to be long ranged but I can use his massive movement to sneak up and melee troops down quickly or have him cripple enemy movement long-distance before my soldiers mop him up with overwatch fire\n    [*]Overwatch fire from soldiers is a big field I set down where enemies who move into the square get shot ( for free, no action on my soldiers part) each time they move through the field, but they also clear a path for other enemies to go through, so you might have to have a couple of overwatch fields to get everyone, but the enemy does try to use this to their advantage.\n    [*]I personally fell in love with the Hydra class the minute he set half of the battlefield on fire and I saw xenos running through them getting torched, only to fall to my overwatch fire or weakly attack my captain and then get slain by his free counter-attack.\n[/list]\n\n[h1] Tactical Character Customization[/h1]\n[list]\n    [*]Characters are outfitted by purchasing ranks in a tree tech system. It is a tree that splits each of the 8 classes into 3 distinct trees. You get points to buy them after each mission. This alone gives you the ability to customize and play whatever squad you want, in a way that you want. You can go crazy with a super tough melee oriented squad, or go sneaky long-range scouts, or just blow up the whole battlefield with Pyromaniac Hydras and grenade slinging soldiers.\n    [*]Combat involves both melee and ranged and both are very good and compliment each other. Melee and ranged are both about positioning your men right. Since this is turn based, but has reaction type skills like Overwatch in it, you want to make it appealing for enemies to engage your melee who can counter-attack them, through your ranged overwatch fields. This is very fun to setup fire lanes and watch enemies fall before your organization.\n    [*] Combat is about escalation and management of your forces and the enemies. Each map usually involves you trying to cut off the enemy forces before they outnumber you too greatly ( or your suits start frying your men because each action builds up heat that can damage you if it gets to high from using it). You can counter this by controlling choke points but the cool mechanic is that you can control tactical points to bring in more templars whose abilities might really help you out - a hydra to ignite the whole battlefield or another soldier to setup more overwatch lanes...or perhaps a stealthy scout to infiltrate and lock down another area where the xenos are pouring in from. This becomes a game within the game in a way.\n[/list]\n\n[h1] Rules System that is explained in game so you don't need to wiki everything[/h1]\n\n[list]\n    [*]Combat resolution is a system of D10 dice rolls made in game that are compared to your opponents opposing dice rolls. This distributed average of hit and misses makes sure that your characters and the enemies are not just getting lucky or unlucky.\n    [*]There are no obvious dump stats when you level up your templars, the game does its best to make every stat important. Aggressive damage stats like Quickness also give you defense bonuses, stats like tactical influence how good your buffs from your men are but also give you critical hit advantages.\n    [*]There are no crazy instant win abilities or stats. Every ability and stat plays into each other very well and makes you build a team of fully functional warriors who need each other.\n[/list]\n\nI know this was a long review, but damn, this game is great and I feel like I am only in the beginning still after 15 hours.

Sometimes you get hit but armor soaks 100%, sometimes you get 100 to zero'd by that same single mob in a single turn.  Simply put the damage calculations are wildly random because of too many factors. Armor, deflection, dodge, block, parry, evasion compete against damage crit accuracy and penetration. There may even be more I can't remeber.\n\nSome things are either buggy or just not clear. Overwatch skill will sometimes hit a target each step he takes in the box. Sometimes tho it won't hit him even once regardless of LOS. Sometimes stats do not update on your character sheet until you get into battle, forcing you to add up all your bonus's to have an idea of what your crit or block is, and even that is off from time to time.\n\nSome of the load out relics need cost adjusted. It is very hard to equip most relics without huge sacrifices at every other equipment slot and they are far from game breaking. Honestly most of them are noob traps as is.\n\n\n\nThe cons I listed are have very little impact at med-hard difficulty, and none at less than medium.

The heat component is great for adding that little bit of extra tactics into your turn choices, and the tech tree is nicely spread out with lots of options to play the way you want to play. That being said, there are A LOT off little things that throw wrenches into the gameplay. The spawning system for enemies is very random. While they mostly spawn next to tiles that look like holes for skitterings to crawl out of, sometimes they spawn on the space directly next to you for absolutely no reason. Additionally, the leveling system takes a huge factor of risk vs reward out of the game, because every unit you recruit will automatically be the same level as the units you've had since the beginning. Units you don't bring into combat still level up, and the skill tree becomes a little washed out because of this. Basically you can lose your geared up Hydra by charging him ahead, and not have to worry because you can spend SP to get another one of the same level with no hassle. It's a shame, because if the game progressed a little more smoothly within the realm of Risk vs. Reward, it would be a 10/10.

On top of that certain battlefield have Tactical Points which can be captured by you or the Xenos.

Your units gain experience and requistion/technology points in missions. The more side objective you achieve and xenos you kill the more xp and rp you get. With xp you can level your units, with requisition you can buy new skills, classes and weapons, powerfull relics in the requisition tree. The tech tree is rather large. \n\nThere are 8 classes: Captain, Hydra, Neptune,  Berserk, Soldier, Engineer, Scout and Paladin.\n\nThe classes have different equipment and skills. Your progression choices on attributes when leveling have impact on the gameplay. A unit with high fortitude and melee skill is good in melee as you can aspect. But you can also decide to try different builds. A standart bearer with excellent party buffs for your captain? Or a soldier with high grenade ability and melee skills? It is your choice.\n\nThe requisition system is interesting and motivates to get more rp to get better equipment and classes. Some are even essential for progress in the game. The paladin as healer or the engineer for capturing strongholds in the level, where you can get reinforcements.\n\nThe tactical gameplay is very good. You have a little rng here, because every actions success is based on dice throws. But if you invest xp intelligently into your units you get nearly 100% chances on attacks and up to 60% block evade for incoming attacks. It is possible to create 'useless' units, if you invest wrong, But you can respec your units anytime in the hq to prepare for missions on normal difficulty. The AI behaves human like. It does not circumvent your overwatch field, it is not omniscent and makes errors. A human player could not know where you place your traps or overwatch so it does not cheat to win. The AI has many units to make the missions more interesting. After 10 missions i had killed 500 aliens. More then in any other turn based tactic game i played before. The missions can get quite difficult when you are slow and not focused on your objective. After all you are fighting against hordes of aliens, stopping and resting will get you overwhelmed quickly. The missions are quite interesting and different. Some times you have to escort a bomb carrier into the heart of an alien cruiser or defend a bridgehead for some time. Or you have to kill a boss while being attacked by waves of aliens. Killing the boss will win the mission.\n\nYour units have movement points and action points to spent. You should move before using action points, because any left movement points are spent when you use your action points. \n\nThe grafics and sounds are adequate. They are 2d, every unit is animated. Unfortunately there is no movement range indicator for enemies, so you have to learn the movement patterns of the different enemy units. Most have 6 movement range like your units. Do not expect Xcom remake like grafics.\n\nIf you like the old star quest or space hulk boardgames this game is made for you. It is space hulk on steroids, with tech tree and a roleplaying stat system and an interesting atmosphere and story.\n\nI encountered many bugs but not one software bug in this game. Performance is flawless. Very nice product.\n\nI am not a fan of pointy review score, but i would give this game a 10/10.

While most \"budget\" tactical games either limit you to a handful of units with flexible progression or offer you a choice of otherwise bland troops with one unique trait apiece, Templar Battleforce gives you eight classes each with a broad selection of upgrades and gear that have minimal overlap with the other classes. Each of your soldiers levels up seperately and has their own stats and skills, making it easy to specialize even soldiers in the same class for different roles.\n\nThe scenarios are objective-driven, usually encouraging a fighting advance, though more defensive and other goals pop up. Maps do not seem to get reused, keeping things relatively fresh. Enemy variety is broad enough to encourage keeping your squad flexible, without becoming confusing. \n\nGraphics are in the screenshots. Clear and atmospheric, they are about what you'd expect from a 2D game made by three people. Similarly, the sounds and music are serviceable, if less than cinematic quality. Still, the strength of the game lies in the gameplay rather than presentation.\n\nReplayability includes multiple difficulties, New Game+ modes, and the option of exploring different paths on the Requisition tree, which unlocks class upgrades and gear. While characters themselves can have their talents, skills, and attributes respecced freely between missions (an ability explained in the fluff), the requisition tree is less flexible.\n\nI'm told there are about 50 scenarios, so I'd guess about 15-20 hours to blow through them all if you're an experienced gamer playing on Normal. \n\nAll in all, Templar Battleforce is an excellent value for anyone who enjoys turn-based tactics games that mix relatively simple mechanics with plenty of options for customization and strategy.\n\nAlso, there's minimal randomness. While attacks can miss and criticals can happen, rarely is an individual attack going to make a difference in mission success.", "timestamp_created": 1443562855, "timestamp_updated": 1443562855, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18252700": {"recommendationid": "18252700", "author": {"steamid": "76561197988000877", "num_games_owned": 797, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 621, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1443767564}, "language": "english", "review": " While low budget, it's a fantastic purchase and the best work I've seen from the Trese Brothers.\n\n   The highest points of the game is an amazing amount of customization.

The spawning in particular can feel cheap and borderline unfair. I've got soldiers overwatching both doors and suddenly an enemy spawns inside the room with us and eating my VIP.

Ex: you can have a Templar throw a grenade for 1AP, fall back with remaining MP then end your turn by using up all your APs into firing action.\nCombined with overheating, this means optimal use of your Templars can be trickier then it seems especially in hectic situations. If I'm making it out to be tedious though, rest assured, it isn't. It enhances gameplay and contributes to the feeling you are commanding a squad of walking tanks.\n\n\nInbetween missions you unlock equipment, abilities and new Templar classes in a tech tree of sorts as well as levelling up and gearing up your Templars. At first the options are limited as you'd expect, but you quickly start unlocking stuff and your Templars are able to carry more equipment as they level, increasing build flexibility as the game goes on.\n\nThe game can be played with ironman settings and permadeath if desired.\n\nThe best points of this game are definitely the squad development which is far more extensive then any other title of this genre I've played and lots of action, you'll quickly rack up hundreds of dead xenos. \n\nAs a 40k fan I was quite partial to the design and feel of the Templars themselves too, a couple of missions has human enemies and/or allies and the difference between normal squishy humans and your power armored behemoths is quite satisfying.\n\nGraphics is probably going to be the biggest barrier for people who care about that. Visuals are perfectly serviceable and clear and I like the blood splatter and gooey messes aliens leave, or for that matter the bloodied wrecks of dead Templars, but I recognize that people born a lot later then me might have more picky tastes so check out screenshots and see if that doesn't bother you.\n\nPros:\n-Exelent rpg mechanics and squad development mechanics, so many games have the rpg tag yet have rather shallow level up mechanics and this isn't one of them. Tooling up your templars is just a joy in this.\n-Linked to the above, you can respect stats and talents any time, so no fear of making \"bad\" builds and you can experiment more.\n-Missions are nicely varied in the objectives and challenges you need to overcome.\n-Great gameplay overall.\n\nCons:\n-Graphics are clear and functional but unlikely to impress. Animations as well can be described as such.\n-Apart from maybe 1-2 music tracks, don't recall the music to have been particularly memorable.\n-There is a story and even some choices to make but this isn't really a game you play for the story. That said, I found the Templar lineage part of the background quite cool and liked how it justified respeccing Templars within the lore.\n\nOverall as far as squad based tactical games go this is a really good title, 100% reccomend it.", "timestamp_created": 1443276079, "timestamp_updated": 1443380837, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.605334", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18201011": {"recommendationid": "18201011", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065227161", "num_games_owned": 114, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 620, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472810478}, "language": "french", "review": "Que voila une bonne surprise, Templar Battleforce ne paie pas de mine au premier abord mais il se r\u00e9v\u00e8le tr\u00e8s prenant et assez complet.

However, I can imagine that some people might be nibbling on whether to purchase this or not, so here is my first impression.\n\nSummary: \nPros: I like the theme, I like the combat, I like the customization of the different character's abilities.  So far I'm definitely on track to get my money's worth and then some. \nCons: Personalities between the different templar are not very distinct (more about that below)\n\nIf you like being a paladin/templar type character and like commanding squads in turn based combat I think you'll really enjoy this game.  Consider that this is an early impression, that may be subject to change later on.  \n\nDetailed Version:\nI bought this game for the promise of commanding a team of badass templar/paladin type characters.  Any time I have the option in an RPG to play a paladin type class, that's what I go with.  It was the theme of this game that really hooked me.  You get to play the good guys, and fight some mean old space aliens.  Nothing wrong with that.  I do hope that as the game goes on I get the opportunity to explore the belief system of the templars a little.  I like to geek out about that kind of stuff. \n\nThe meat of the game is the turned based combat in which you use your templars to fight against Xenos.  The combat works well.  It's easy to jump right in to the action and pick it up as you go.  I don't think its revolutionary or anything but that doesn't bother me.\n\nCoupled with the combat is the all important customization.  Each level you get points that help you specialize in different types of abilities.  This is another main draw for me.  Rather than just a few different units with set roles there is the potential for enormous specialization.  At just over two hours I haven't even scratched the surface of the what I can do.  \n\nThe problem so far with the game is that none of the templar characters are distinctive.  The \"captain\" of your squad has generic dialogue that makes he or she indistinguishable from your other squadmates.  The captain doesn't have an established name or backstory, none of them do.  They're all here to protect the remaining humans from the Xenos, and any other threats.  That's it.  I'll have to see how the rest of the game unfolds, but my main criticism for now is that I'm not really invested as I should be in the plight of these generic templars.  Some humor, maybe a character who's faith is challenged by seeing his people go through this, or anything to change it up a little would be appreciated. \n\nI'll update this post once I feel I can do the game justice with a full review.  With my criticisms in mind I still say with confidence that I like this game, and I think others will too.

Do you like turnbase-tactical-combat like XCOM ? This game might interest you.\n\nFirst of all: The Wh40k reference isnt just a \"maybe\", its a fact. This game screams \"Wh40k\" but isnt the shitty license-soldout game that GW produces lately. Sci-Fi Setting, Templars are Space Marines, your enemys are Tyranids. As a wh40k Fan you will smile by all the little hints the game gives you. The background story, the dialogues (Vae Victus! Only death ends duty! The honoured fallen will be remembered!\") the setting, the weapons, everything. :D\n\nThe combat system makes sense, the level design is very different and viable, so you dont play every mission like the one before, the level/xp and loot system kinda grabs you by the balls and you instantly wants to achieve more unlocks to get better equipment and Templar classes (which btw are also like wh40k.. captain, tactical, assault marines, apothecarius, techmarine, scout, devastator and sternguard - ingame called captain, soldier, berserker, paladin, engineer, scout, neptune and hydra.)\n\nEven if i like wh40k and i kinda believe that the devs wanted to create their own version -> There is still alot of work to do. Most important:\n\n- you cant choose which Templars deploy in the mission, you start with a random team and if there is a tactical point on the map you teleport some of your veterans in with Points. BIG FLAW for a game like this.\n\n- the UI still lacks a lot of informations on the battle field and needs to be improved (skills are all explained, iam talkin about the mouse-hoverups and battlefield informations. still kinda clunky.)\n\n- I need more different gear items for my templars and more different enemies.\nGimme orcs, necrons, etc. all the good stuff. Not just tyranids.\n\nI can still recommend the game, caus i believe there will be updates and then its getting really good and escpecially for all the wh40k fans -> a real alternative to live our hobby without the shitty GW games out there.\n\nPS: NO CRASHES OR BUGS FOUND.\nAlways a good sign.\nHigh quality standard.", "timestamp_created": 1443214046, "timestamp_updated": 1443214046, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.421391", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18188730": {"recommendationid": "18188730", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999385566", "num_games_owned": 229, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 2970, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1443841900}, "language": "english", "review": "In a few words, Templar Battleforce is a 2D XCOM set in a backdrop that is heavily inspired by Warhammer 40k. It is somewhat rough around the edges but is surprisingly easy to get into if you have a general idea of what to expect.\n\nThe core tactical combat gameplay is very well done and even exceeds games like XCOM in some areas such as flexibility and variety. While the internal mechanics of combat suffer from the opaqueness of the dice rolls system and of the damage mitigation formula, the game offsets this with ample toolips and a set of starting missions which guide new players through all they need to know to enjoy the game. Extra praise is deserved for both the tooltips and tutorials as these two elements are rarely well done in indie games and are often quite mediocre in AAA releases.\n\nCombat itself is familiarly intuitive and draws much of its allure from the fairly deep customization options and progression available. First off you have a sort of tech tree which controls the pool of equipment, active abilities, and recruitable templar classes available. Every templar in your band belongs to a class which defines which active abilities are available and which equipment can be equipped. In addition to equipment and talents (active abilities), every templar has two sets of defining statistics which can be increased by one point each level. You will end up customizing talents, equipment, and attributes for each templar every time he levels up which will be every 1-2 missions. This is so since you can freely respec any templar between missions and you will want to do this when new abilities or equipment become available, which happens almost after every mission depending on how you choose to progress the tech tree. This opens ups the ability to experiment freely with your squad build and keeps you from worrying too much about planning your progression ahead of time.\n\nI was also very happy with the mission design so far (about 10 missions in). The length of each mission is right on target with about 30 mins on average and the overall pacing is excellent so far. The time I\u2019m spending in mission and out of mission leveling my army is at a good ratio to prevent being fatigued with either aspect. The missions themselves don\u2019t drag out with most missions aiming for around 15 turns on average to complete which keeps each turn and what you do in it very significant. The heat mechanic plays an important role here. Heat builds up from using abilities and moving and decreases a small amount each turn and will decrease a lot in a turn if no or almost no actions are taken during that turn. Maxing out on heat will start causing hitpoint damage to the templar so this helps keep the action tense makes you consider every action you take or don\u2019t take during a turn.\n\nI have a few small gripes with the game which affect my enjoyment of it in very limited ways. No ability to change keybindings is regrettable but not critical since the default scheme is workable if somewhat inconvenient. The way vision works could use improvement as your templars can only seem to see 5 squares away which can lead to very awkward ambushes. Enemies can attack the same turn they spawn which is annoying but since they don\u2019t spawn in packs, for the most part, this is nowhere near as big an issue as it was in XCOM. There is plenty of room for the UI to be improved and enhanced with such features as moving the camera via mouse screen edge scrolling, highlighting interactable elements on mouseover, indicating which squares either your unit or an enemy unit can move to this turn or the enemy's next turn. The Devs have indicated that some of these fetures, edge scrolling in particular, will be added in future updates.\n\nThis is a game I would highly recommend to anyone who enjoys turn-based tactical RPGs in the style of the recent XCOM or going further back to Temple of Elemental Evil and Pool of Radiance. The story is very adequate for a game where the story is arguably not the main focus and works very well to build up the right atmosphere of tension and heroics and this is a type of game that benefits greatly from having that kind of backdrop. The ample depth of progression available for your \u201carmy\u201d and each templar along with way the game encourages experimentation will keep most players hooked.", "timestamp_created": 1443202366, "timestamp_updated": 1443284785, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.552632", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18182149": {"recommendationid": "18182149", "author": {"steamid": "76561197965418683", "num_games_owned": 279, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 777, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1443310875}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm not big on writing reviews to be honest.\n\nI've only written one to date but this game deserves some attention.\n\nI was very reluctant to purchase this game at first because there has just been so much low budget stuff on steam of late but because I had a little change in my wallet and the fact the game is priced correctly I decided to give it a go.\n\nI have to say I am more than delighted with my purchase.\n\nTrese Brothers have done a fantastic job, both with the game and with their community interaction.\n\nThey are a credit to game development and how dlc and support of a game should be managed.\n\nThe big guns out there, could learn a thing or two from these guys.\n\nI won't go into the story or key features here as you can read all that from the game store page but I will say that the features they list are correct and the game does what it says.\n\nThe squad customization is truly inspiring, if a little daunting at first. \nWhat I mean by that is, you don't have AAA graphics here so the tons of equipment and various skills and talents throw lots of numbers at you instead, which can be the daunting part.\nHowever, given a little time and some missions into the game you start to come to terms with it all and then you can't help but want to play more missions to earn more RP to get that new piece of equipment or unlock that new Templar type.\n\nWhat I like most about building your Templars though, is the fact that you really feel the difference in the changes you make. \nA lot of games fail in that regard, you get excited about a new piece of kit or a skill and it proves totally underwhelming in actual combat. Not so here. \nYou get a new sword and all of a sudden you're single hit killing those low level Xeno's that used to need two hits. \nCrowd control is a thing, and now your Templars are ready for it!\n\nI feel the game also does a good job of satisfying the needs of players who like varying skill levels. I often see the arguments about casual and hardcore gamers now, well to me all games should be capable of supporting both by the use of difficulty levels. \nTrese Brothers have added many difficulty options to suit all players and each level has a good description of what it actually does so the player isn't left guessing and trying to figure it out themselves (Yet another thing the Brothers should be commended on).\n\nThe game does so much right and the Trese Brothers really have poured love and affection into their game and will continue to do so (for Free, I might add).\n\n*Edit: All of the below minor complaints from me have been patched and fixed and the devs continue to update the game. Brilliant devs and they deserve huge credit for everything they do.*\n\nThe very few minor things I disliked or found confusing about the game are already being responded to and were the majority have voiced an opinion are being changed.\n\nThings like the speed of text during cutscenes, I'm slowing down in my old age and I find I am having to rush to read which breaks immersion of the story for me. It confused me because during missions you have to click to forward text and I felt this should be the same for cutscene text.\n\nDuring the starting missions of the game, before you really know what is going on, you are asked to activate a gate but the switch you use to do this just looks like any other map flavour tile and the fact you can click on it is not immediately obvious. \nI lost a few turns here, while thinking to myself, Alright I'm in the area you told me to go to, why isn't something happening? Because you didn't click the switch dumbass. Well it wasn't really that obvious game :D\n\nThe open and closed deployment before going into a mission confused me because whenever it said open I was clicking furiously around the screen for some way to take the Templars I wanted into the mission. \nBefore I finally went to the forums and read that 'open' means you can get a control point in the mission which will allow you to call in more Templars as opposed to actually allowing you to take what you want from the beginning. \nAnd closed meant there would be no control point and what you get is what you have for the full mission. (This is something the devs are addressing and will be updated to allow you to take what Templars you want outside of what is actually needed for the scenario, like an engineer or scout etc).\n\nLastly the fact you left click on an enemy to see their stats but also left click on an enemy to attack them. \nIn the later missions of the game it is important to watch your Templars heat and balance moving, damage and other various skills. \nSo I often want to check the health left on an enemy to be sure I can kill it in another way before taking a shot with the same Templar again. \nThe current system can lead to mistakenly taking shots or using a skill you did not want to. \nYou can unselect your Templar or their skill before clicking on an enemy to avoid this but I feel it is a little clunky and could do with being changed.\n\nAs I said, these things are already been looked into by the Trese Brothers and overall I think they did an amazing job with this game.\n\nI definitely recommend this game to anyone who loves Turn based strategy and squad building games and if you are new to the series and just dipping your toe in I couldn't fault you starting here.\n\nWell worth a purchase.\n\nI hope when the Trese Brothers grow into producing AAA titles they remain true to their current values and continue to price their games correctly and support them as they do now.\n\nThank you Trese Brothers.\n\nI look forward to what I hope will be a very long and bright future for you in video games.", "timestamp_created": 1443164093, "timestamp_updated": 1444997977, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 83, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.835011", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18179979": {"recommendationid": "18179979", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983390871", "num_games_owned": 100, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 9669, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478958693}, "language": "german", "review": "Kleines, feines Turn Based Strategie Spiel.

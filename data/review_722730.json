Your capabilities are defined by the items you acquire. There is no experience (no grinding!), you gain 'levels' by climbing to the next floor. This system makes various builds equally viable: combat, speed, stealth, all sorts of hybrids and so on. \n\nItems are not just stats +X. You will balance energy output, heat generation and support with your combat capabilities, speed and information gathering capabilities. There are over a thousand different items: weapons, power sources, cooling, propulsion, sensors, armors, shields, hackware, build and repair utilities and many, many more. Each item has a cost to use it, with more powerful items typically having bigger costs. There are various synergies and you can get some sick combos! But don't get too attached to the components you currently own, because sooner or later they WILL get destroyed. That's why you constantly need to acquire new parts (they are everywhere!) to rebuild yourself, sometimes completely respecializing to a different build type (You were a heavy tank, machine of destruction, but after a particularly tough fight not much is left of you? Time to become an ultra light jet that zips past enemies before they get a chance to act!).\n\nLevels are procedurally generated, parts you find are randomly chosen, encounters are random (reasonably!). Each playthrough will be different and you will never get bored of it. Even veterans find early levels non-trivial and thus replaying the game is interesting, challenging and fun at all times.\n\nThere is an exciting backstory which you discover as you play. With each run you find something new and new things just keep coming! It's actually really fun to hunt for these lore pieces as you play.\n\nThis game is 'turn based', but you're not waiting for your opponents to move between your turns. Everything happens immediately. If you can click fast enough, you could do a 100 turns per second. Only when you need more time to make a decision (or contemplate your inevitable doom) the game will slow down for you. Think of this 'turn based' system more like an active pause - you get as much time as you want when you want it, but otherwise game moves forward smoothly. Even better - you can fast-forward less exciting parts like exploration (when nothing of interest is found) or waiting for that patrol to pass by.\n\nI love this game: it's unique, it's challenging, I get to manage the risks I take, story is awesome and game is hugely replayable!\n\nThis game however is not for everyone and here I'd like to point out some common reasons not to buy this game (if applicable to you; you are the final judge):\n[list]\n\t[*]Randomness - there's a lot of randomness: floor layouts, encounters, parts you find. It's not a slot-machine-kind random. It's more like some card games randomness (i.e. Hearthstone). You get to make your choices and manage your risks at all times. You are guaranteed to get something and if you're versatile enough, you will get something useful. But hoping to get a very specific item will not get you this specific item most of the time. \n\t[*]Permadeath - you will die a lot and then you will need to start from a scratch. Game is designed around this, so that repeating early levels is not boring, but still challenging even after dozens of times. Having fun in such games is a matter of mindset. Remember: you are not supposed to win this game. Have fun trying out new builds and optimizing old ones. Think how can you improve, what tactics and strategies can you deploy. Learn from your loss. Try beating your previous score. I'll repeat: you are not supposed to win. Thinking otherwise will bring disappointment to you.\n\t[*]Graphics - you can see it in the screenshots and it's a common thing to drive players away from games like this one. Decide whether you're fine with it.\n\t[*]Font size - BIG WARNING HERE: UI is designed to have a certain minimum number of rows and many smaller screens (including some laptops) cannot fit this many rows of readably large font. Check this [url=http://www.gridsagegames.com/cogmind/ui_preview.html]link (provided in the game description as well)[/url] to see how this game will look on your screen.\n\t[*]Keybindings - There are multiple predefined control schemes, including pure mouse, pure keyboard, Vi keys. Custom keybindings [strike]are not a thing[/strike] require manually changing files and some players are complaining about it.\n[/list]", "timestamp_created": 1514212553, "timestamp_updated": 1514242188, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38638434": {"recommendationid": "38638434", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073282866", "num_games_owned": 24, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2422, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2422, "last_played": 1514152235}, "language": "english", "review": "I absolutely love this game!  I've enjoyed roguelikes for a while and am always impressed by the diverse concepts the indie scene nutures.  I love this style of game where you build yourself up from your fallen foes, or sneakily procure enquipment with your handy servo-mounted discount (you pilfer).  Imagine waking up in a small room with scrap parts all around.  All you know is you have to mining-claw and EM Pulse Cannon your way out of a massive complex of machines that mostly want to disassemble you (like Johny-5).  You find goodies everywhere, and mostly by taking out pesky defender driods which stand in your way.  The levels are awesomely generated and its never the same game twice.  You have to adapt to whatever surroundings you encounter.  Sometimes you get swarmed by nasty little auto cannon droids, sometimes railgun commando robots.  That's ok!  You are cogmind.  You adapt, you survive, wading through scrap heaps where your enemies used to be.  Personally, I've never seen such care and love put into a game.  Everything has its own sound.

You can equip your bot to be a fast flying hacker, or a tank treading missile launcher and many more!\n\nThis game does not feel like an Early Access or Beta. It is fully playable, fun, with no bugs (as far as I have seen).\nIt is an amazing traditional Roguelike with modern design and usability.\nIt is deep, full of theme, great animations and sound.\n\nPros\n- Active and transparent developer.\n- User friendly UI\n- Deep gameplay mechanics\n- Lots of surprises if you can live long enough to find them\n- Story and lore to keep you coming back to learn more\n- Very challenging\n\nCons\n- Small font might make it inaccessible to some people.\n- So far there is not much music (plenty of great sound effects though)\n- Very challenging (this could be a pro or con depending on your tastes)\n\nLong review.\nI first heard about this game on Steam and quickly starting looking in to Let's Plays and reading about it.\nI have had a hard time finding a traditional Roguelike that I enjoyed. Most had bad UI or bad controls or just did not provide enough of something new each time to interest me. I very much enjoy many modern rogueLITES (ftl, dungeon of the endless, steredenn, enter the gungeon etc..) So the ideas of traditional roguelikes are very appealing to me but most have failed to provide the experience I was hoping for.\n\nCogmind has since changed that. It provides a great focus on usability and player feedback. Animations and sounds all provide the player with the theme and feedback that makes it \"feel\" polished. Each time I play I find a bit of lore or an npc or surprise event that I have never experienced before. This really encourages that \"one more turn/floor\" feeling.\n\nCogmind requires a lot of inventory management and you will be constently making decisions on what to keep and how to \"build\" your robot. There are many \"systems\" that interact with each other and learning how everything works is a big part of Cogmind (and roguelikes in general).\n\nTrying new and weird things is encouraged by this game. After each death (and there will be many) I always think of what new \"thing\" I could try.  New robot build, new tactic, new path through the world, how do I get back to that awesome event that I just found...\n\nThe developer has been working for several years and has released a fully playable game. Why it's even early access I don't know. Just know there is more \"stuff\" to come.\n\nI feel comfortable recommending this game in Early Access at Full Price! It is well worth it. You can also check out the Gridsage game website to provide the dev with more support if you are able.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1513293368, "timestamp_updated": 1513293368, "voted_up": true,

The setting, sparse lore (somewhat like Dark Souls the plot is revealed in small snippets and item or environmental clues, very little is forced on you), and mechanics are all master classes in design and implementation.\n\nThe game is hard, you will die a lot. When you're first beginning and are still learning the mechanics it will often seem completely random when you perish. Fret not, as soon as the mechanics start to make sense and you figure out how the gear works you'll realize that there are a plethora of resources available. If you've played Don't Starve it mirrors that beginner's experience in a lot of ways. At first it seems almost impossible to scrape through winter, or the first 3 levels of Cogmind, but after a little experience you'll see resources everywhere. Unlike the traditional rogue-likes, games like Nethack or Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup, Cogmind has much better balance and there's not really any filler gear that isn't very useful. Moreover, the awesome mechanics of the game allow an insane amount of characer customization without using experince points or needing any grinding. Its a hard mechanic to describe and you'll have more fun figuring it out yourself so I'll leave it at that. \n\nThe interface makes you feel like an operator in the Matrix, the whole aesthetic is simply awesome. While the game has no music at the moment the sound effects and visual animations are excellent while still adhereing to the ASCII asthetic that the game is a clear homage to.\n\nAll in all this is a fantastic title that has managed to be the best RPG and strategy/tactics game I've played this year, the story is gripping and gives me a good reason to dive back in even if all I manage to do is unlock a couple extra lore pieces.

Check. Combat is very satisfying, with positioning and tactics being very important if you wish to get rid of your enemies as quickly and painlessly as humanly (or, well, [i]robotically[/i] in our case) possible, and believe me: ideally you want to be operating at top efficiency. Winning a skirmish or ten isn't going to do you much good when you have a war to win, with attrition being a very real and sizable threat, so you have to think ahead, and in order to be able to do so you'll need a very solid understanding of the way the game works, and combat mechanics are just one piece of the puzzle.\n\nGraphics? Check. Classic ASCII mode is available (and toggleable with a single keystroke) if that's your thing. Otherwise there's a very solid tileset at your disposal, as well as fancy animations, juicy explosions, and whatnot.\n\nAccessibility? Check. Tutorial and in-game manual are there to guide you, covering just about everything you need to do. You can play the game relying strictly on your keyboard and nothing else, but mouse support is there as well, and it's extremely smooth. The UI feels just right: it works perfectly well right out of the box without any tweaks whatsoever, but if you need more/different info, that can be arranged. Combine all this with I've said about the graphics, and you get something that can appease both the veteran of the genre and the newcomer alike. Finally, there's a number of difficulty settings, so if Cogmind is tormenting you a bit too mercilessly on the default difficulty, there is a way out.\n\nSetting/plot? Check. Can't say I'm fully familiar with both at this point, but I believe I've seen enough to say that whatever is going on here, it's pretty damn intriguing.

In this respect, Cogmind is top of its class. Graphical developers everywhere should take cues from how Cogmind renders game events in a way that gives both visercal satisfaction at seeing your enemies torn to shreds, as well as concisely communicating information to the keen player.\n\nThe game itself is fun, and the concept of \"put yourself back together with parts scavenged from dead enemies\" is very well applied. In fact, the entire game is balanced around part availibility from finding them in random rooms and killing your enemies, which is something quick players will adapt to easily. Your first win might be out of sheer luck after at least several failed runs where you learn more and more, but experienced players can win reliably (although going for high scores does take some luck and playing the same seed multiple times for optimal moves).\n\nMultiple branches already in the game, with more on the way. Experienced players will be able to plan out what branches they want to take, determining a large part of their build and victory method.\n\nPlenty of lore for the nerds to dig deep into.

To me, Cogmind is a true roguelike in a modern style. While you can play in ASCII and keyboard mode, the game offers a tileset that feels and stays true to its initial look along with a very well done mouse control, which can be played mouse-only or hybrid with keyboard. It takes a lot of work to implement both this well, especially by only one person creating it and I consider this a big freaking plus, because we, the players, have the option and can choose whichever we prefer. Along with a clean UI that provides all necessary information at most a press of a button away, you will rarely find this amount of polish in an EA game.\n \nAs for the gameplay, it's got the basic roguelike features of being turn-based and randomly generated maps (along with many handcrafted parts). Since it's placed in a futuristic setting, it introduces a new type of equipping yourself besides the standard head, torso, four limbs etc. gear which I found is a very refreshing idea. This also opens up the possibility for very different builds and such different approaches of playing the game. The \"true\" roguelike part however definitely comes from its hidden mechanics - Cogmind is brutally hard, many struggle just getting through the early game, but this is by design. You are supposed to learn and improve slowly until you get a feeling for what's happening, influencing it to your advantage and thus increasing the chance of survival. There is no handholding, nor will you find precise answers on how these mechanics work, you'll get hints at most. Now I do understand that this may throw people off, the main reason why I'm mentioning it and you can trust me, I have also raged at the game, many times... but that's sort of the point of a roguelike, because once you get better, it provides a rewarding experience not many games are capable off.\n \nI have around 200 hrs into the game and can (somewhat) reliably win a run, but true roguelike also means, I am merely increasing my chances, things can and will go wrong. Then again, this is not where Cogmind ends, there is a ton of optional areas available with lots of lore to be found, some of which will lead to different endings. You could consider them an extra challenge, while they do provide benefits, getting there is usually way harder than just advancing on the main path and I have yet to see them all. While every world seed has all of the optional stuff in it, they are not always on the same level, so even if you aim for something specific, you may end up somewhere completely different, which makes for quite unique runs overall. Also, if you're the completionist type, bring a lot of time, because you will need way more than what I've invested so far.\n \nIf you are concerned about the EA label, don't be. Cogmind is a complete game already, along with lots of content and a polish I'd wish some finished products would have. Yet, the developer is still improving on the game, even though being hindered by a severe injury currently, he invests a lot of time and is very responsive on the forums. Only if you're new to the roguelike genre, especially the turn-based variant (real-time is just, well... different), I'd say start with something \"lighter\". For the rest of you, I do not see a single reason why you would not get you're money's worth out of this great game. I, for my part, am really not satisfied easily, but Cogmind has provided me with so many different and fun-filled runs so far that I'm inclined to call it the best roguelike experience I have had, ever.", "timestamp_created": 1510368552, "timestamp_updated": 1510368552, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 30, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.735222", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "36331702": {"recommendationid": "36331702", "author": {"steamid": "76561198190448867", "num_games_owned": 49, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 701, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510606938}, "language": "english", "review": "This game turned out to be exactly what I needed.\n\nIt's turn based, so there's never any rush to play it - if I need to go do something, I simply get up and do it, the game will wait.\n\nIt can be played exclusively with the mouse/one hand.

Choices you make are what get you killed. You are given the information to make good decisions, there are few random unknowns. No more having to drink every potion and die just to find out what it does.\n\n[*]Multiple weapon/damage types in a sci-fi setting. A huge welcome change to sword and magic. Blast your enemies with electromagnetic weapons, melt them with thermal. Blow the whole damn room up with rockets, or smash in their face with a hammer!\n\n[*]All parts you equip (you are a robot built from the parts you find) can be destroyed but also repaired at special stations. Find new parts from fallen enemies (if you didn't use a weapon that obliterated them) or find them in storage rooms. Try any combination and discover which ones are best for certain situations because you don't have stats limiting your use. Make use of different propulsion, utilities, weapons and cores. Protect your core at all costs with exterior plating and excess parts.\n\n[*]Escape in one piece! Once you reach a new level and evolve your core is replenished to 100%, meaning just escaping with 1 core integrity won't mean you die instantly on the next level. However if your core is corrupted (through EMP or other ways) it will last unless you find ways to fix it! Find allies along the way or even build a robot army to help you crush anyone you pass, but careful reinforcements might be coming since you caused a huge commotion!!\n[/olist]\n\nOverall this is a fresh take and a great roguelike where you are presented with lots of data to carefully examine and make decisions with!", "timestamp_created": 1509304884, "timestamp_updated": 1509600452, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.548387", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "36115749": {"recommendationid": "36115749", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072604105", "num_games_owned": 88, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 352, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511370785}, "language": "english", "review": "Cogmind: a transcendent cybernetic experience that I can't recommend enough as it effectively scratches the itch for Turn-based Sci-Fi Roguelike Retro RPG endless goodness. \n\nI saw someone mention Cogmind on Reddit, referring to it as \"additctive as Rimworld\".

A Rouge LITE would be The Binding of Isaac or Magicide, a Rouge Like would be for example Sword Of The Stars: The Pit. and Cogmind fits in the Rouge Like genre, it\u2019s a turn based, RPG type, adventure game, that is hard as shit to get into. \n\nThe game starts without launching to a menu, it doesn\u2019t send you into a tutorial on your first start up it just tosses you in, tells you to go fuck yourself, and leaves. That\u2019s basically the first 30 seconds of the game. After your first crushing defeat, having no idea what the hell is going on, you start picking up on small things. Now you know how to attach your wheels, how to shoot your guns, which mind you is pretty fucking annoying, and what some of the modules do. \n\nWhile starting your first game you\u2019ll probably be overwhelmed by the UI, it\u2019s a little bit spooky and has a lot of information on it. Don\u2019t worry about it for now, it\u2019s best to just play through a couple times and slowly learn about the data and what it means instead of sitting down building a spreadsheet with all the info you have. The game isn\u2019t an entrance exam to university, the best way to learn is multiple attempts.\n\nIt\u2019s an incredibly difficult game to just jump into, but once you get past that initial hour you start figuring things out and can enjoy the story of this game, and jesus there\u2019s a lot of story content in this game. In a single play through you won\u2019t be able to learn about the entire world, only sections written in Terminals that you must hack to gain access to. Cogmind has an incredibly in-depth well written world. \n\nThe game has a pretty neat art aesthetic as well, it can be a little daunting again trying to figure out what everything looks like but you can change whether you want the ASCII art style, or basic textures. personally I\u2019d recommend playing in the ASCII version, I find the Textures to be a little lacking and not very interesting compared to something like Sword of The Stars. \n\nThere\u2019s a lot of interesting ways you can play the game as well, you could build yourself to be a massive tank with huge weapons shooting rockets, lobbing grenades, blowing up walls. You could also be a stealthy cheeky beaver burrowing through walls, avoiding your targets. There are plenty options for you to experiment with, you can even try being a Robot Samurai with the Katana\u2019s, though I think you\u2019ll die pretty damn quick\n\nOne problem I had was the lack of music in the game. Hopefully this is something the dev is looking at as this game is in Early Access.\n\nI do find this game to not be as in depth as Sword Of The Stars: The Pit but it is still something worth checking out.

You spot an engineer trudging along, rebuilding delapidated walls. You sneak up to it and attack it with a Datajack, a makeshift hacking device only usable at short range. Miraculously, you succeed in accessing the engineers inner systems - of which you have the option to gather information about the droid, attempt to overload its systems, or link it with your own, allowing you to see what it sees. You decide to try and link with it, but it fails, and the engineer quickly runs off down the corridor. You are unable to catch up to it as you are equipped with aluminium legs you acquired from dismantling a combat drone earlier, and they arent fast enough to catch the engineer before it alerts an Informer, who then alerts the combat units in the area. Positioning yourself, you wait for the drones to reach your location so you can tear the parts from their burnt, metal carcasses and use them for yourself. Seeing them approach, you open fire with your weapons - a grenade launcher, beam gun, and particle cannon. All three miss, with the grenade hitting an adjacent wall, blowing it open. Another droid emerges from the debris, and begins firing at you. Its missiles destroy two of your weapons and reduces the integrity of one of your power cores. The battle rages on, and you manage to destroy one of the three combat bots, but not before your power cores give way to the fire. You begin to run. Passing through a door, you look for an empty room to hide in, but before you can progress any further, your aluminium legs are severed by a blade trap. Unable to move much faster than a tile a turn, you decide you will wait.

It feels like the Binding of Isaac sometimes for me - that is, unsuccessful runs tend to be a slog, while lore-filled or successful runs are far more enjoyable.\n\nI originally wrote a negative review here (preserved below). Combat felt tedious at best and each run seemed nigh-identical to the last, but response from multiple people including the developer and some community members prompted me to continue playing to see if the game held more. [b]It did[/b] - it had a lot I'd yet to see.\n\nContinued playing revealed not only more areas to explore and parts to utilize that I still hadn't seen, but random encounters I had uncovered an aspect of the game I had yet to even scratch the surface of, making interactions with various machines far more interesting and variable. Not to mention how fun the encounters themselves were - I've found two so far and both were incredibly interesting to me, largely in part because I love good lore and both events were densely packed with it.\n\nEven so, I still have issues with this game that have yet to see resolution, and while further playing may yet have them solved (and if so I will update this), they are still worth mentioning regardless. Before I dig in, however, be aware that:\n\n[b]I have not finished the game.[/b] I have reached -3 (presumably 3rd-to-last level) at the farthest.\n[b]There is surely a LOT I've yet to witness.[/b] Plenty of which could mean a number of changes to this review.\n[b]I have a lot left to learn in terms of how to play.[/b] The only build I can successfuly construct thus far is a combat one - I am still trying to create other suitable configurations, and until then any comments from me about their existance or potential should be taken with a grain of salt.\n\nThat all said...\n\n[h1]Things you should know[/h1]\n\n[i]+ Positive\no Neutral\n- Negative[/i]\n\n[b]+ The lore is fantastic.[/b] I'm a sucker for a quality story, and this game has plenty to offer. Everything from dialogue to stories dug up from terminals is well-written and fun to read, and I constantly find myself excited whenever I find more.\n\n[b]+ Decent atmosphere.[/b] While ambient noise is uncommon, the sound as a whole is well crafted wherever present and never becomes annoying. Additionally, the graphical style - whether you use the ASCII variant or the default - fits together nicely at all times, and I've yet to spot a single thing out-of-place with it.\n\n[b]+ There are plenty of parts and many, many options for building your character.[/b] When the game mentions its part diversity, it isn't exaggerating at any point. I am constantly finding new things to attach or try out, and even amongst those I'm already aware of I still find new uses or even entirely new builds to take a shot at.\n\n[b]o Maps are very large, and game mechanics tend to encourage leaving sooner rather than later.[/b] It certainly depends a lot on your build as to whether or not you can stick around, but more often than not it's wiser to simply leave for the next level. If you're looking to explore a lot, you need to be careful - even if you've outfitted yourself specifically to do it.\n\n[b]o Combat can become boring if too drawn out.[/b] This is another one of the issues that applies moreso depending on what kind of run/build you have. If you're more combat-oriented, odds are almost no fight will truly last unless it is a particularly tough enemy. If you run something less armed, however, you could find yourself embroiled in potentially troublesome lasting skirmishes if you aren't careful.\n\n[b]o Few builds seem effective without some level of dedication to combat, though this might just be me.[/b] As I stated earlier, I'm still in the process of designing a working setup of another type, so it's hard to tell just yet.\n\n[b]o The game can be very hard at times.[/b] This has gotten easier as I've learned more things that I can do, but can still be occasionally overwhelming. When I mentioned I got to level -3, I did so on Easier difficulty; even when toned-down, the game can sometimes be quite difficult. This used to be a negative, as easier modes used to lock some areas out, but as of Beta 3.1 this is no longer the case. [i](Special thanks to the dev for being so receptive to feedback on this!)[/i]\n\n[b]- System Corruption is too influential per-turn.[/b] A subset of the difficulty, but still separate enough to warrant its own point. System Corruption is rarely a straight-up killing factor for me, but I still find it rather annoying to deal with, as even 1% corruption seems to cause something to screw up unusually frequently. Combine this with the fact that (as far as I know) any level of corruption can cause any manner of negative side-effect, and you get problems like a weapon-misfire from 1% corruption causing a nuclear reactor to get shot and blow up in your face.\n\n[b]- Ambient sound is uncommon, and I have yet to hear any music at all.[/b] Some games can pull off no music just fine, but they usually do so by making up for it with ambient sound - generators humming, steam leaks hissing, etc. While Cogmind [i]does[/i] have this sort of thing, they feel somewhat rare to encounter and few machines actually seem to produce any noise. Put this together with other sounds only occuring on a per-turn basis and you can get long periods of silence taking away from the overall experience.\n\n[h1]In the end...[/h1]\n\nWhile Cogmind definitely has a lot of effort put in, and is certainly a well-made game, whether or not you should get it varies; I personally didn't enjoy it until I'd put in tens of hours. Hence, I'd recommend it - but only if you think it likely that you'd like it, too.\n\n[b]Old review:[/b]\n\n[i][b]EDIT:[/b] The developer (as well as several friendly community members) responded to my review in the comments regarding combat, and it seems they are right about it so far from what I've seen. Continued play has revealed evolving weaponry more makes combat less tiresome (as it ends very fast) and as I continue I am still finding plenty of new elements to improve my play style with. I'm not going to change the review score just yet as some parts still seem somewhat tiresome, but if things continue to improve I may yet do so.[/i]\n\nI'll say it straight up: I don't like this game. While I respect the effort that clearly went in to it (a lot!), the gameplay comes across as very lacking. I find myself suspecting I'm missing something that brings the charm, seeing all the positive reviews, but after four hours of play I still can't find the entertainment.\n\nThe lore is good and the sound effects hold as much variety as was promised (and then some), but this is strongly offset by repetitive gameplay. Exploring can be nice, and combat is interesting at first, but both become dull as you go on. Exploring lasts far longer however, as new items and areas show up at a good pace.\n\nCombat is another story; I quickly found myself exasperated with constant streams of enemies and every time new ones appeared I ended up sighing with frustration at the slog I'd now have to deal with. With combat almost entirely consisting of 'Press F to begin targeting, then shoot them, repeat until someone dies.', things get boring extremely fast. Worse yet, even after learning not to push things too far with terminals, enemies still seemed to pour out of every nook and cranny regardless of what I did.\n\nIn the end, while I still respect this game and its developer for all the work involved in this product, and while it still has a number of very good elements, I found this game far too grindy to personally be worth $18 (or $20 - I got it on sale). I can't say ignore this game - it has too much potential for that - but unless a good sale comes around or combat gets improved, I'd suggest holding off just yet and seeing what happens first.", "timestamp_created": 1508667994, "timestamp_updated": 1510473889, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "27", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "35913352": {"recommendationid": "35913352", "author": {"steamid": "76561198097780693", "num_games_owned": 282, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 823, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509269389}, "language": "english", "review": "Extremely cool reimagining of the roguelike genre.

I've been a roguelike fan for many, many years, and this is one of the best UI implementations I've ever seen. It's hard to imagine that you could describe a roguelike with words like intuitive, simple and easy to navigate.  In my first playthrough, I only had to look up three things (how to activate the terrain scanner - Hint: You don't. It's passive -, if it was better to have high or low movement numbers - Hint: Lower is better, but there's trade offs -, and how support and penalty factored into movement - Hint: Support is the amount of mass you can carry while penalty is the amount of movement added if you go over this amount). The rest of it was very easy to figure out quickly. I did end up reading the manual, but it was a very quick read, and doing so cemented what I had already figured out while illuminating some more obscure aspects of the game.\n\nThe swapping in and out of components is exceedingly satisfying as you build your bot into something to be reckoned with, and while there are no \"Levels\", you will go through evolutions that expand your capabilities which could be likened to leveling up. I was glad to see that evolving also reset the damage you've taken, so it's not a constant fight against unstoppable attrition.  \n\nSo far, it's a fantastic game that I'm really looking forward to exploring much more.", "timestamp_created": 1508541312, "timestamp_updated": 1508541312, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "35874167": {"recommendationid": "35874167", "author": {"steamid": "76561197964577234", "num_games_owned": 489, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 3242, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509324996}, "language": "english", "review": "MY NEW LEGS!!\n\nThis is something much more than it seems; it is a take on a classic, proven formula for roguelike (not lite) exploration with absolutely new mechanics that make it a brand new experience. I have at least 6,000 hours in roguelikes, half of which is Dungeon Crawl: Stone Soup.\n\nInstead of leveling, you select new slots; power sources (important for energy weapons and shields), propulsion (important for movement and evasion, also total weight), utility (the one slot you can never have too many of), and weaponry. You start with 2 of each, and you get more as you go deeper. Killing enemies gives a chance for new parts, but also a high chance of a net loss. You have matter, which is used for kinetic weapon firing, and energy, used for energy weapon firing. Both also interplay with utilities, and utilities can convert one to the other.\n\nAdding parts has just enough of a cost to not be done excessively but allowing for regular upgrades. And parts themselves have two stats; the amount of HP they have, and coverage. The only way to die is to get hit in your core, and the only way to defend it is to have parts. Weapons, propulsion, and certain utilities (especially armor) contribute most to this. However, parts regularly take damage from combat and will eventually break.\n\nA main restriction is inventory space, which can only be expanded from an absolutely insufficient 4 with utility upgrades. I try to get by with +10, but +20 would help a lot...\n\n'Builds', as they are, is twofold: Selecting upgrade slots and then finding the appropriate items. However, things will change. In one game I got all my parts more or less wiped out in a big battle twice without losing the game. My core took a lot of hits, but cores recover from leveling up. So I had to piece together what damaged parts I could from my defeated enemies. I cobbled together an interesting gun-based build, then got all my parts wiped out again, and am currently doing a very successful energy weapon build. Inventory space is vital to have backups to replace in or after combat. Losing all your guns means you flee or die.\n\nNPCs are interesting and have a point. They repair level damage, gather non-stored items, and sometimes carry very valuable stuff. Still, the level is either random rooms or mines. I wish there was more variety and unique level areas.\n\nGripes:\n\nUPDATED! System Corruption is cleared when you upgrade Cogmind. If it gets really annoying, just stop looting and ascend higher. It's still exceptionally annoying, however. Firing my Rocket Array into an adjacent field of nuclear reactors while trying to sneak is the worst thing it's done to me. Or dropping my last wheel due to rejection when trying to flee... okay the last one was kind of hilarious.\n\nBuilds. I like that you tend to find plenty of random stuff, but your inventory is just too small. I would love a way to store items during a run in a terminal and be able to retrieve them later. Backup weapons and parts for when I am ravaged that I can find later would be great. The schematic and fabricate system is interesting, but is utter RNG. Some runs I find only ways to store schematics, others I find only fabricators. I'd like a way to better use what I already have.\n\nUtility slots are too good. Power only matters for energy builds. Excessive weapons build up too much heat... and the only answer? Utility slots. Armor is vital, and so is storage options. I find there is far too many vital utilities, with many very interesting ones I have to pass on due to simply not having enough. I can't handle more than 4 weapons even with 2 heat sinks for long engagements. It would be nice if things like batteries, storage and armor could be added to a new type of slot that improves once per upgrade or every other upgrade to give some more room to experiment.\n\nStill have a lot to try out, like speedy stealth builds, melee builds, and whatnot... this'll be a game I put a lot of hours in.

gameplay with a lot of unique twists to make it standout from the crowd. Coming from DCSS as my all time favorite roguelike, some tactics apply but others don't. Basics like fighting in corridors to avoid being swarmed are crucial. However, unlike most roguelikes, item destruction is a core mechanic in Cogmind. Your equipment is easily destroyed and needs to be replaced with higher quality parts. At first this feels impossible to overcome, but you'll steadily learn tricks to sustain yourself better. The equipment system is also extremely in-depth. Managing matter, energy, heat, integrity, coverage, mass, etc., makes putting together a build feel like an addictive puzzle to solve.\n\nThe tiles/ASCII/animations are all gorgeous. It's never been as satisfying to press 'f' in a roguelike. I'm currently playing with ASCII because the tiles are a tad small on my 1366x768 laptop resolution. The atmosphere combined with the bits of lore scattered about make this world great to explore. The amount of polish in this game is unmatched by most roguelikes. \n\nI'm still terrible at Cogmind, but I can't get enough and I learn a little bit with each death.

A retro ascii presentation with modern amenities (alt. tile-set graphics as well).  TONS of raw data in the form of items, weapons, stats, etc.  Walls and walls of text that may sound daunting on paper, but is instead categorized & presented smartly, making the game feel weighty and dense with content.  Wasn't expecting it but the writing & story are high quality as well.  You talk to other robots with unique personalities, pick up logs, hack terminals for info, etc. all fleshing out the world.  Every story bit is numerically cataloged in a Log that remains persistent between runs.  Pulling up that Lore Log reveals that there's hundreds of entries to fill in.  So you keep building the narrative no matter how many times you bite it.  I understand that there's 7 unique endings as well.\n\nPlays way faster than I would have imagined as well.  Feels like BattleBots a bit in that you're always gathering up new gear (mobility, offence, defense, scouting, etc.) to equip yourself with and all those items combine to create an outer armor layer that protects your Core, which contains your true HP.  These various items degrade in combat so you're always on the lookout for something not only new and exciting but also with a high condition as it doubles as shielding.  It's a great push-pull dynamic.  Since it's turn-based it feels kinda XCOM with \"Hit %\" readouts during encounters (Pro-Tip: enable Tactical Display\" in Options for even more in-game combat data). \n\nGame may look real Dwarf Fortress in stills, but in motion it's way more flashy.  Lots of particle effects, screen shake for explosions, text & image overexposure & trails...stuff that makes it feel like a merge of vintage & modern technology.  Surprising amount of unique ambient sound files as well.  Not something you'd expect in this kind of game.  Though on the flip side there's no music, and that's a conspicuous absence.\n\nSo yeah as I said, this thing is the real deal.

Even though back in the day I spent quite a bit of time pillaging the rooms and narrow corridors of Rogue, the glorious days of action-packed simplicity quickly faded away, only to be replaced with more and more complex games that pushed the genre forward. While obviously a great trend for those who love their games deep, this also proved to be an intimidating factor for people like me - as studying a myriad of hotkeys before even considering a successful run of ADOM or NetHack became a must. However, as time went on, some modern roguelikes managed to find a middle-ground between streamlining the interface and simplifying the gameplay, and Cogmind is the prime example of this commendable approach.\n\nThe game is extremely easy to delve into - in fact, a blind play is not only suggested, but encouraged in the game's manual. Thanks to the ease of use and clear-cut UI, the exploration of the dungeon becomes a pleasure, not a chore. The most necessary functions are always at the tip of your fingers, the intuitive drag&drop interface takes care of the bulk of your management needs, and you're left with the most important aspect of any true roguelike - strategising. And oh boy does Cogmind shine in this area. \n\nMost of the individual enemies or even enemy groups don't pose an immediate threat to you. In fact, you are quite capable of disposing of hostiles almost right off the bat. However, the mastermind behind the facility that you found yourself in thinks on a global scale - as such, your primary concern is not about immediately destroying whatever you find in front of you, but surviving the long battle of attrition as you navigate your way out of the underground complex. The alarm systems, robot patrols, enemy informers and traps are all connected on a global level. Disturb them too much - and a full-scale army invasion is imminent, in which case no amount of battle prowess will ever save you. However, should you choose to play the system, carefully manipulating the current alarm level, disposing of lone guardbots and avoiding detection, you will most definitely uncover the secrets surrounding this fantastic place - and escape with your core still ticking.\n\nIf you're tired of memorising all the possible combinations of Ctrl+, Shift+ and Alt+, can't be bothered to regulate food and water consumption for basic survival and don't care about intricate differences between picking up items comfortably, quickly or normally (which falls under \"basic\" commands in some old-school roguelike titles), then Cogmind might just be the game to try.

with it.\n\nThe biggest difference aside from the looks is that there is no XP grind, levels and classes. Everything is done with parts that you constantly pick up, upgrade and switch to adapt. Your lifeblood is your core that is partially protected by these parts. Resource management exists in form of energy, matter and heat.\n\nThe control scheme is very intuitive and works with only mouse, keyboard or both and can be switched via a single button press.\n\nWhat I like in particular (aside from general gameplay and feel) is the UI that really supports the games ideas and its design core. This has to be one of the most interesting, functional (drag&drop and a compare-item function in a roguelike) and satisfying UIs I have seen so far. Its usage reminds a bit of tiling window managers with a tabbing function.\n\nThe aesthetics are a nice blend of ASCII and tiles with some graphical effects (cool explosions, fade-ins, graphical glitches if you are corrupted, etc.). You can switch between ASCII and Cogmind-style on the fly. The interface does an awesome job of explaining everything directly or via popups so that the (spoiler free) ingame manual is not really needed. Still, if you want some formulas and examples, feel free to read up.\n\nCogmind features an extensive hacking system that even has a manual option where you can type the commmands. To complete the hacking experience, the commands are cAsE sEnSiTiVe and the console has an auto-complete function.\n\nThe robot world is alive! Destroy something and robots will come to pick items up, clear debris, investigate, rebuild walls, dig tunnels, etc.\n\nThe entire game breathes old meets new.\n\nCogmind now resides along with [spoiler] Deus Ex and Jagged Alliance 2 1.13 [/spoiler] on my \"survival thumb drive\" for the deserted island / rogue ai / robot revolt scenario.", "timestamp_created": 1508350316, "timestamp_updated": 1508451555, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.611307", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "35822768": {"recommendationid": "35822768", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023416519", "num_games_owned": 135, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 997, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512958537}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutely recommend without hesitation.\n\nCogmind is a roguelike in its own class - withOUT classes, or levels, or skills.  As you progress, you gain slots into which you install a vast array of parts, of four categories: power, propulsion, utility, and of course weapons.  This provides both an incredible amount of customization (since you choose what type of slots you gain) and a demand for careful balancing and planning: depending on your preferred means of propulsion (until it all gets blown off), you can only support so much weight before slowing down.  This means you can't fly around bristling with eleventy billion cannons unless you want to go very slow.  Slap on treatds, though...  you must also weigh the energy demands of your various gadgets - scanners, ECM, etc all take energy, as does moving, and firing weapons.  You need enough power for all that.\n\nSo, my experience thus far: scavengers are little assholes.

The sprawling facility is dotted with terminals that you can hack for, among other things, interesting lore.

All objects are labelled when they come into view. Everything is also color-coded; for example, all hostile robots are yellow. The sound in Cogmind also really helps paint a picture of the facility in your mind: my favorite is listening to the ceiling crumble after blowing some things up with the grenade launcher.\n\nThe combat creates a lot of interesting and fun decisions. You might start shutting off systems to save energy, or run away for a little bit for your systems to cool down. Sometimes parts will get destroyed and you'll have to fight without a leg, or swap in your backup power source, or run over to some destroyed robot while under fire and attach their weapons to yourself to fire back.\n\nFinally, this is a roguelike, so every run is different.

Well, they move.  So what if we make your character a robot that you can swap in varous types of mobility, from legs to wheels to hovercraft.  A @ attacks, so how about your character can attach weapons to itself and fires them all per turn.  A @ restores energy per turn to do things, lets look at that somewhat literally, energy in the form of power generators and batteries.  A @ does all sorts of interesting utility things,  lets stick those in utility slots.  Your inventory becomes your character, and the entirety of your character becomes this sort of evolving classless microcosm with lovely, lovely stat numbers.\n\nWhat about the map?  Well, the map should be generated with a high degree of variety and excellent procedural generation mechanics.  Done.  But what if we want to make the map a living thing?  What if it's inhabited by robots which actually move around the level, expanding the map, rebuilding lost bits, picking up and moving scrap?  Lets give everyone and everything on the map a reason to be there.  Now *this* is a roguelike map with some significance!\n\nHow about the lore?  Given that all the robots on the map have a reason to be there, you emerge as a strange robot looking to understand a strange world.  Scattered throughout the level are many terminals which are very miserly with their function, but with multiple runs and lucky rolls, you can pry the story of the world out of them.  Each failed hack risks bringing down the guards upon you, but what can be more precious than secrets to an amnesiac starving for answers?  A certain satisfactory dynamic narrative emerges, not only a greater understanding of this robot-run world, but your character's place in it.\n\nDo you think roguelikes require difficulty?  Cogmind is difficult.  In fact, for the most part I would say you would be better rewarded with stealth, because the setting is one of a hostile world where you are hopelessly outnumbered if you attract too much attention.  I have played more difficult roguelikes, but I have to say I really like the balance I see here.  You will die, of course, with tradtional permadeath.  But each time, you will have learned something new, and have an interesting new strategy to consider going at it.  Like any good roguelike, being brutally returned to rock bottom is an exciting starting point.\n\nDo you think roguelikes require ASCII graphics?  Cogmind has you covered.  In fact, whether you run in ASCII mode or not, you're in for a treat of some of the finest tile-based animations to grace a parser.\n\nIt all ties together expertly, with a craftman's attention to nailing the fundamentals and implementation.  All this, well worth your $20, rock solid and playable, and he calls it an Early Access game.  \n\nOn top of that, I have to say the developer's a real nice guy.  He practically runs the roguelikedev reddit and stoicly puts up with my blathering about the things I do in Unity which can hardly even hold a candle to the magnum opus that is Cogmind.  I like to dream, but I lack focus.  But this game is a lovely reality, and an inspiration to what I might do if I can get my act together.

The controls for Cogmind are very easy for newcomers to learn quickly and are well explained. UI works and looks great, and really gives you the feel of being some sort of robot-thing. Reminds me alot of the UI that Duskers has. \n\nGraphics: The default tileset for Cogmind looks good, clean, and crisp for a roguelike, but where the graphics for Cogmind really shines is it's UI (like I said earlier, beautiful and very atmospheric) and the graphical effects of weapons, items (such as scanners), explosions etc... are perfect and impressive while still remaining true to its 2D roguelike roots. Really pushing the bar for roguelikes everywhere. \n\nGameplay: Fast-paced battles while trying to stay alive and figure out what's going on, unsure if you'll even make it out of this fight.

While the game is less demanding than Brogue (from the perspective of simply winning, which is still quite challenging), with less seed variance (an approach with pros and cons), the game has effectively managed to appeal to me in a similar manner, in consistently providing decisions with satisfying amounts of complexity that can lead to some very interesting results. There is little in gaming that has been more fun to me than designing various killer-robots consisting of over 20 salvaged/found/fabricated parts in the lategame, with a similar amount of items in inventory, constantly modifying the specific layout based on finding better parts or simply replacements/alternatives to damaged ones, getting some actual pusback from the Complex such that even the best bots still have to think about their actions.\n\nI would recommend the game to anyone with an appreciation for challenging and complex game mechanics, and Cogmind gets a lot of bonus points for presenting that complexity in a way that is viscerally satisfying, this is the one clear advantage Cogmind has over Brogue and similar games: it's rare to get such strategic depth [i]and[/i] astonishing sound effects, beautiful ASCII art for over 800 items, lore entries that add a lot of flavor to exploring the world, and an actual interesting story to discover, even if it is difficult to fully discover, being sort of in the background and featuring challenges beyond simply making it out of the Complex alive.", "timestamp_created": 1508207711, "timestamp_updated": 1508253556, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.602295", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "35784456": {"recommendationid": "35784456", "author": {"steamid": "76561197968567439", "num_games_owned": 1265, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 31, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509747318}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing modern major roguelike by amazing people.", "timestamp_created": 1508203800, "timestamp_updated": 1508203800, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 41, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.629389", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}}}

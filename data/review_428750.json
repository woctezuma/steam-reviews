Or neons (There is NEON in game's name for a reason :)\n\nMusic is well suited and I can't say bad word about other sounds.\n\n\nAnd gameplay is the part where this game shines the most.\nYou play as one of five classes: hacker, cyber psycho, soldier, assassin or techie. They differ and prety much everybody states that one of them is overpowered. Although it would be different class each time. They are well balanced - have strong sides and flaws - all you have to do is find the one that suits you and your playstyle the most.\nLevels are generated ramdomly (with exeptions) and each playthrough would differ. They are themmed acoridngly to floor you are currently in (like living quarters, hospital, warehouse). And there is boss after each floor.\nEnemies have different abilities, strong sides and weaknesses.\n\nColectibles are changing rules drastically - you can collect new weapons, energy consuming secondaries and cybernetic implants. You are also collecting money.\n\nOnly way to spend all cash is to... die. You can buy upgrades of health, damage, energy and luck. But in first place buy all slots for cyber-implants (max 10). Then choose new \"asset\" and try again.\n\n\nAfter few tries (and upgrades) game will become easy enough to kill last boss and finish story.. or not?\nIt took me about 6-7 hours to do that.

When your agent dies, you can pick from a new set of agents, each from one of several different classes and with a set of gear & abilities randomly selected from what you've unlocked before. Do well enough and you can have that new agent start from a higher floor, and each time you beat the Overseer it is like a \"new game +\" mode, where you and the enemies all get bonuses.\n\nI have been having a stupid amount of fun with this game. The graphics are crisp and colorful, the controls are easy and responsive with a PC compatible X-Box controller, and it is just very satisfying overall. The difficulty curve, once you get used to it, is also just the right side of hard, where you feel like you have a handle on each enemy type but each encounter is still threatening and tense, and resources are always scarce.\n\nThere are some (very!) minor issues. The story is fairly basic and minimal. Sometimes the level RNG will generate rooms where your upgrade and loot containers are surrounded by explosive barrels, so it's almost certain every thing will blow up before you can get to it. On levels with walkways, the money and energy drops from the enemies will frequently fall off the side into the abyss. The game has some issues with certain graphics cards (like mine!) so if you play in full-screen it will often do a quick switch back to the Steam program and then back to the game, so you have to play in a window. And last, but not least, the sound effect for the normal doors sounds just like a melee \"whiff\" from a ton of other games, so I keep thinking there is a dude I've missed who is taking wild swings at me.\n\nBut regardless of minor problems, the rest of the game is just silly fun.

Blast your way through walls & enemies with guns and cybernetic abilities. Install perks from cyber chambers and upgrade your character stats after each death. Can you stop the Overseer?\n\nI love cyberpunk and top down shooters, so it's surprising that I haven't heard about this game earlier. Just got it in some Humble Bundle bundle and damn did I have some fun. It's your basic top down shooter with cyberpunk vibes. During your playthrough you permanently unlock cyber-implants that you can find on some levels plus you can level up dmg/hp/energy for $$$ found. Levels are randomly generated and every few floors you have fixed levels with bosses. Technically it's not very complex and there are only 4 bosses, but that's cool.\n\nBecause the execution is definitely on point. Shooting is fun, procedurally generated levels are fun, cybernetic enhancements are fun. Everything is really enjoyable. Well, if I'd had to find something I'd say the story, if we can even call it that, is nothing to write home about. But then it's a procedurally generated top down shooter and not an adventure game. It took me more than 10 hrs to complete the game twice, after each completion a higher difficulty is unlocked, and do some achievement hunting.

The atmosphere of the game is very adequate and the senses are flooded with music and images that take us to a skyscraper that is the seat of the organization that dominates the society. Your goal is to reach the top where the leader is and force him to surrender. You will do this by using clones and operatives specializing in incursions. Their control over these operatives is made through an equipment that lets them enter their minds through an operating system and data network.\n\nI know, I know ... it's a lot like Matrix, Ghost in the Shell, Tron, Blade Runner, Total Recall and other Sci-Fi classics. But this is good! That is the proposal. The elements of these classics are all there. Like the Matrix immersion chair, the first Boss that reminded me of the end of Ghost in the Shell, the music and colors of Tron, the buildings of Blade Runner.\n\nThe art of NC is very well cared for to convey the right feel to this kind of story. Drones, computers, armed agents, lasers, neon lights (obviously!), high buildings where don\u2019t see the ground, everything is there. The models are not very detailed. This is evident when you open the pause menu, but since distance of view leaves these models smaller, this is not a problem. They are varied types of characters that we can control and fit well the class to which they belong. Weapons vary by color and size (since the weapon models are very similar). The backgrounds are adequate too. The animations are interesting but not very varied. There could be a set and more stranded, but that does not affect the game so much.\n\nThe sound of the game is a show apart! The music score are perfect for the environment and nostalgia will affect you for sure. These are good-sized compositions that remind you of even those great movies I quoted up there. Look for the OST because it is very good. I'm listening here now! Sound effects are cool. Like animations, the effects could have a greater variation and personality, but they are good in general.\n\nThe gameplay is a top down shooter that requires you to watch out for enemy shots. Each weapon has a different amount of shots and reload time, and you will, over time, evolve your weapons making them more powerful and faster. There are different types of ammunition that affect enemies differently: drones are most affected by laser shots while plasma injures humans more. No spoilers! It's cool to find out how each enemy reacts with each weapon. (Although this does not vary its animation, what a pity!). The strategy involved in destroying apparatus and obtaining keys are at all stages. Some walls are destructible and others are transparent causing the enemy to see and chase you. But do not worry, they're not very smart. The game is procedural, but some stages mark your progress. One clever thing in this game that I noticed is that Bosses are very difficult when you reach them the first time, so you repeat the stages several times to upgrade your character and only then can you defeat him. Hmm interesting design! I can not forget to say that ogame allows local cooperate, which makes the game more fun!\n\nNeon Chrome supports Mods and in a very organized way. The community has all kinds of things that teach you how to make different models and how to apply. This one I tested! And there are several other mods with pertinent changes that will please you.\n\nIn summary, NC is a fun and challenging game that will take you a few hours and there is also a DLC with a multiplayer arena if you feel good enough to go to war! I grew up in the 80's and got lost from the rest of the world playing Neon Chrome.\n\nLong Live the Nostalgia!

What initially drew me in was the aesthetic; this is a gorgeous display of cyberpunk. The gameplay itself surprised me: while most twin stick shooters I've played involve a lot of \"run backwards and fire\" strategy (and Neon Chrome certainly has its moments of that), many of the firefights involve careful use of cover and choke points. This is bolstered by the destructible terrain. Many objects and walls can be destroyed, allowing you to ambush enemies or flank their shields. The guns themselves have a decent variety, although I wish they dropped more frequently. There is also a nice assortment of enemies, each promoting different tactics. One caveat that this game has is, at least so far, it's not particularly difficult; the flip side of this is that I haven't had any moments where I felt the difficulty was artificial. Overall, I highly recommend Neon Chrome.\n\nUpdated 12/12/17 - I'm up to Overseer Level 7 (Overseer Levels being a New Game+ mode) and the challenge is getting real.

The cyberpunk presentation is cool as well. I beat it once, after about 6 hours, but it's possible to continue in New Game+ mode, and I might keep playing. It's a good game, but not an excellent one.\n\nNeon Chrome is a top-down shooter with permadeath that you can play fast or slow, swooping in with guns blazing or picking off enemies slowly with stealth. That being said, using stealth is going to take a while. As you play through the procedurally generated levels, new enemies show up to keep things fresh, and there are four bosses distributed across the game. The bosses are okay, not frustrating but also not all that interesting.\n\nThe character progresses through weapon upgrades and biotech upgrades. The weapon upgrades are a simple level system, but you have to change your weapon to a different type to take advantage of the raising level. The biotech upgrades are gained from upgrade machines. When you find one of those, you get a choice of three upgrades of which you can pick one. Some are better, some are worse, but all of them are in some way relevant. As you play you unlock various new weapons, abilities and biotech upgrades that can from then on show up randomly anywhere, on the current and any future characters. Also, after you die you can upgrade various stats that make all your future characters stronger. And you can choose a starting weapon, ability and biotech upgrade for your next character, for a price. You can also enter the game at several checkpoints, but you will lack upgrades, so this is only really viable after playing for a while to upgrade your global stats.\n\nIt's quite a fun game, it looks cool, sounds cool, and doesn't waste your time. I recommend this for people who like top-down shooters. Due to the short game length I wouldn't pick it up at the current full price of 15\u20ac though.

That means that while there's an end-game, you can repeat the whole process with higher difficulty, and since every floor is procedurally generated, every single experience will be different.\n\nThe gameplay is really nice if you take off Vsync in the game's files, guns are really fun to use, there are a few different classes of characters (of which you'll be able to pick between 3 everytime you die), the music is synthwave and really addictive, and the graphics are well done. It's a refreshing title that doesn't need too much thought to play, and I really liked it in short bursts. Also want to mention that there are a few unlockables that you might find in your playthrough; special weapons, abilities, normal weapons. Unlock them once, and they'll have a chance to drop in weapons crates/abilities pods/augmentations pods, making every single character a different customization and making it not repetitive.\n\nRegarding the game longetivity, the devs have said that the usual player takes from 7 to 14 hours to finish one playthrough. I finished it in 5, and while I'm a good player, I don't think I'm incredibly gifted. If you're good at hotline miami you'll not have a lot of troubles in the game.\n\nTo the point; you collect credits that you can use before starting another round in permanent upgrades or weapons/abilities for your next character, and only your next character. It's a fun way to make the game easier, though I spent all my money on luck.\n\nThis game is a great short game, really fun and addictive, it's a shame I have a great backlog of over 20 games, otherwise I'd play another playthrough.

The game is fairly easy to play, but the some of the achievments were surprisingly difficult.\n\nConsider that I tend to like easy-ish games because they're casual, but I obsess on challenging achievments.

The replayability is impressive (to me); you can choose a different style of play each time you boot it up, and yet accumulate statistics in the form of purchased upgrades, no matter which character you play.  After beating the game, you have the option of increasing the difficulty yo the next levelk, which increases dropped rewards, etc.\n\nOverall, Neon Chrome delivers casual fun in a way that kept me playing for longer than I'd planned on playing.

That's a bit too basic, though, and not 100% accurate, of course, so I'll go into a bit more detail. \n\nIf you didn't already know, the big difference between a rogue-like and a rogue-lite, is that although both give you randomized maps and you start the game over if you die, rogue-[i]lites[/i] give you some form of progression/unlocks that is saved between runs. Neon Chrome is the latter, letting you keep the money that you picked up from enemies and loot boxes, and essentially letting you continue past bosses you have beaten, using the money you earned on your run to purchase persistent (permanent) stat upgrades for all future runs. This is much like the system used in Rogue Legacy, though I actually found this game to be a lot more fair and designed to encourage tactics more so than to simply abuse the player.\n\nThat leads me into the Hotline Miami comparison. No, you don't just die any time you're hit, but I'm referring to the real-time tactical aspects of that game. While some players may have run in like a screaming barbarian, clubbing everything and zooming around rooms trying not to get hit while taking on an army of guys and being shot at, I tended to be stealthy, going into a room and killing enemies before I was seen, thus reducing the odds of death and systematically getting myself closer to victory. You can do that in this game, too. It's unlikely you'll go unseen, but you can minimize the number of enemies who have seen you at times and use doors as bottleneck killzones, and corners with your laser sight to line up easy kills.\n\nPlaying like this helps to even out the deficiencies in your stats or in your gear, while the persistent upgrades give an enjoyable \"vengeance\" sensation while wiping the floor with enemies who used to make your life suck when doing another run. The randomized parts of the game consist of enemy placement, map layout, and per-run weapons and cybernetic implants. The former come in a variety of well-designed weapons you'll grow to learn the strengths and weaknesses of, while the latter give you amazing bonuses, such as 50% max health capacity bonus, +100% manual reload speed, immunity to mines, 35% HP recovery upon completing a floor (so good!), and many more. On each run, you get a new character (random 3 to pick from a la Rogue Legacy) with pros and cons to him or her (Hacker rocks when trying to make lots of cash!). Try several character classes and see which one(s) you enjoy most.\n\nDid you find a weapon you like? Why in the world would you ever bother opening another gun box when you have the gun you want to finish the game with? Well, the developer was very clever here. At the beginning of the game, it's a level 0 gun, with pretty awful stats. If you open a gun box, not only do you get a new gun you can choose to take or leave, but [i]all[/i] gun drops on that run are now leveled up higher, and thus have better stats! Why visit weapon upgrade machines if you're using a gun you want to ditch ASAP? More brilliance on the developer's part. Using the upgrade machine [i]also[/i] levels up all future gun drops on that run. If you go visit all gun boxes and upgrade machines, max level guns should be dropping by end game, which really helps out. I could go on about the things you find to unlock more things, but it would just be rambling.\n\nA successful run in which you kill everything and collect everything will probably be about an hour and a half in length, and it goes by pretty quickly. If you die and finished a boss, you can start over around level 5, 11, 17, 22, or 29 (I'm sure I'm off on a few of those, sorry!), by stepping into an elevator with the appropriate section number (1 through 6), with each one lighting up after you beat that chapter's respective boss. The bosses are pretty simple but well-designed in their attacks and movements (I love the second boss). Personally, though, I played from the beginning whenever I died, because it's so rewarding if you open all the gun boxes so you have higher-leveled weapons by end game, and you can breeze through the easier, earlier levels while unlocking more things for future runs and getting more cash.\n\nAn hour and a half long if you play it well? I'm sure most people will need a few attempts to win, but yeah, it's not a super long game. If you're one of those folks who sees value in game length, though, this is absolutely a \"new game plus\" game. The big screen on the right in your starting room says \"Overseer 1.0\" but if you win the game, it shows 2.0, do it again, and 3.0, etc. You can use a computer console in a room on the left of the starting room which shows you a bar graph of the various stats in levels, including enemy HP and damage, as well as loot amount. The loot amount goes reeeeally high when going from one difficulty to the next, giving you much, much more money per kill and loot box, letting you get your stats maxed in a jiffy.\n\nBut what in the world do you spend your money on between runs if you've maxed out all your stats? You spend it on per-run guns and per-run cybrnetic implants. At the top of the starting room are three consoles which let you purchase and level up certain guns for money, as well as take specific cybernetic implants of your choosing and a combat ability of your choosing instead of relying on randomness on future runs. Each successive implant costs much more money than the last, but it's really worth it to get the must-have ones for your playstyle (max HP and health recovery stuff for me because I'm pretty terrible!). The developer really thought this stuff through and clearly put a lot of time and effort into it.\n\nLong story short, here we have a top-down shooter in which you can be somewhat tactical along the lines of Hotline Miami, with persistent purchasable stats between runs like in Rogue Legacy. It's got a nice cyberpunk asthetic, and the developer clearly cared more about making the game be fun than a pain in the rear. It can be challenging in your first couple of hours, before getting any stat gains, and before all of the glowy cyberpunk things in levels finally register with your brain so you know what is a decoration and what is something vital you need to interact with, but eventually your skill, even if crappy like mine, will likely allow you to triumph with some nice persistent stat gains between runs making up for your weaknesses.\n\nI planned on \"gameplay\" being the final segment of my review and actually wrote it first, but it turns out there was so much to say that I'm basically out of room for everything else! Let's hit up the other main points of the game in rapid-fire mode!\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nIf I had a pie chart of the relevancy of each aspect of the game, story would be 1% of the pie at best. It's not awful, but it's pretty forgettable and just kinda there. Story is normally a massive motivator for me, but the gameplay was of such a high caliber that I was completely fine with the lack of interesting plot.\n\n[h1]Graphics/Art Style[/h1]\nI like the look of the game, though my only complaint is that for my first maybe 2 hours, everything is so glowy that it's easy to thing decorations are important objects in the game world when they're not, or to confuse important objects as being decorations when they're not. It all clicked with me after a while!\n\n\n[h1]Music/Sound[/h1]\nOne of the human enemies dying sounded kinda like a sergeant from '90s Doom dying at times, so that put a smile on my face, and the music was decent. I actually adored a few brief parts/sets of notes in a couple of the songs.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nOutta room! I really liked this when i thought I wouldn't. I tend to dislike most rogue-y games and top-down shooters aren't a big draw for me, so this game is all the more impressive. :D", "timestamp_created": 1494822699, "timestamp_updated": 1496028293, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.589173", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31740873": {"recommendationid": "31740873", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993502989", "num_games_owned": 672, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 560, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495533722}, "language": "english", "review": "Want something with a retro feel, that top-down shooter with mindless button-clicky and the ability to upgrade?

of how good this game is. In my youth I played Crimsonland a lot however it was a rather basic isometric shooter. My interests in games changed from being solely a \"shoot everything that moves\" style to things with more depth. While I still enjoy that kind of game I prefer games with replayability, choices and of course satisfactory action. Neon Chrome was a huge suprise to me when I got it and I have enjoyed it greatly. The randomised levels add a detail of uncertainty, the gunplay is very satisfactory, the colors, theme and soundtrack blend together like a cyber-punk grape smoothy.

I will most certainly update this as I accrue more playtime. Thank you for your patience\n========================================\nCore Gameplay\n----------------\nThe game plays like a more forgiving hotline miami but feels like your classic twin stick shooter, albeit with much more customisation and abilities. You choose a character from a pool of 3 (although later on you can choose weapons, characteristics and abilities that are certain to appear in your pool for that run) and they are your \"asset\" for that run. Your aim: destroy the overlord on floor 30. You must fight (or stealth) your way through while collecting weapons and abilities and upgrade your loot level/current weapon.\n\nItems/Abilities\n---------------\nThere are a lot of weapons and abilities to unlock. The unlock system is very balanced and you will find yourself wanting to start from an earlier section just to try and pick up unlocks that you've missed! Abilities are awarded by entering a chamber that gives you an ability that you've selected from a pool of 3 (4 if your class is cyborg) and you have to be quite tactical with your abilities as you can only have a set number of them\n\nGameplay (In-Depth)\n----------------------\nThere's rarely a dull moment. Whether you're dodging turrets, fighting robot spiders or trying to get behind those GODDAMN RIOT SHIELDS you'll cherish the times you get to stop for breath. You can upgrade weapons by finding loot caches and you also upgrade your loot level which determines how good future gun drops for that run will be. Enemies do not spawn too frequently nor too slowly which is excellent. You always feel as though you are progressing as well which is excellent.

Kung Fury nailed it too), handed us a gun, packed a top-down level with angry soldiers and robots, firmly pat us on the butt and told us to \"Stick it to 'em\".\n\nThe controls are tight and responsive, the gameplay starts out hectic but doable, and the upgrade system makes the difficulty curve your own responsibility!

Also your character is actually much sturdier than in Crimsonland, which is funny for a roguelite but it fits the format better since you don't heal up between levels.\n\nAs a roguelite, it has a gradual perk unlocking system that makes the binding of isaac look incredibly detailed by comparison, but actually, the high-level unlocks are obviously intended to allow scope for a little bit of a \"build\" aside from simple max dps.  Simple stuff like \"shots have 15% chance to stun enemies\" + \"stunned enemies take double damage\".  Between runs you spend the money you earned on permanent boosts to damage, or perk slots, yada yada rogue legacy upgrade your castle we've all seen it.  It's all done very well here.\n\nIf you enjoy roguelites, it's not as fun as the binding of isaac but currently, in my opinion, no roguelite is really trying to compete with that.

Once I gave it a try, I was hooked for several days straight! I usually don't binge rogue-like games, but a very select few have managed to grab my attention. Neon Chrome is one of them.\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\n==========\nNeon Chrome is a cyberpunk top-down rogue-like twin stick shooter. You are an operative trying to take down a corporation called Neon Chrome, that's run by a ruthless Overseer. The premise revolves around sending your operative's consciousness into an \"asset\", sort of like in James Cameron's Avatar film. You then use this asset to navigate through the many floors of the Neon Chrome building, fighting your way to the Overseer at the top. There are a variety of weapons and enhancements to help you mow down the hordes of robotic enemies and guards that you'll ve facing.\n\nAs this game a rogue-like, expect to die. A lot. However, the money and experience you gain each run will help you progress further and further each run. You'll learn how certain enemies move and behave, their attack patterns, and the best tactics/weapons to use against each. Money collected can be spent on permanent stat upgrades, or even to pre-equip yoru next asset with weapons and enhancements of your choice. Every so often, usually at random, you'll come across special pods that bestow cybernetic boosts. These boost gives you special abilities or increase your stats by a large margin. For example, there is one that increases your HP by 50% and your speed by 25%. You keep these boosts for the entirety of each run once found (and they can be unlocked and found again later!), but they are lost if you die. \n\nThe Neon Chrome building is full of procedurally generated levels filled with traps, locked doors, and things that go boom. Almost everything you see can be blown up or destroyed....including precious loot boxes. Thin walls can be destroyed, but thick walls cannot. Locked doors can only be opened with keys, and these keys are either hidden in a room or held by a special Keymaster guard that must be defeated in order to obtain the key. You'll find all sorts of loot boxes, which usually contain money or energy tabs, which replenish your store of energy that is used on special attacks. Every 5 floors you'll unlock a \"checkpoint\", where you can start your next run from if you die. \n\n[b]Graphics[/b]\n==========\nThe overall look and feel of Neon Chrome is amazing. Very vibrant and colorful. Cyberpunk influences everywhere. I love the art direction. It's not super detailed, but it's good enough. The game works with what it has, and excels at what it aims to do. However it can sometimes be hard to keep track of your character amidst the explosions and ammo flying around. Different weapon types (laser, plasma, etc) have different colored projectiles, most enemies get a new color when you meet a new variant, and power-ups/collectibles are very well defined and easy to spot. Keymasters are clearly labeled with a big red \"KEYMASTER\" over their heads, and later on stronger, more dangerous guards have their names over them as well, some of the ones I remember seeing were \"CHRIS\", \"SCOTT\", and \"LENNY\".\n\n[b]Sound and Music[/b]\n==========\nI love this game's soundtrack!!! There's a few different tracks, and they all have a different feel and energy to them. Boss music gets you pumped (like it should). Each floor has a different theme to it, and it changes when you move to a new floor. Overall the rest of the game sounds great. Explosions are awesome, even if they are your latest cause of death (and they will be quite often). Your different weapons types all sound different as well, so you can oftentimes tell what kind of weapon your opponents have just by listening to the sound and the rate of fire.\n\n[b]Performance[/b]\n==========\nI have no complaints here. The game runs nigh perfectly. I did not experience any problems whatsoever, even when there was total chaos on-screen. No dips in performance, freezes, or FPS loss. I played the game with my Logitech F310 controller, and it felt great. Left stick to move, right stick to aim, R2 to fire my gun, L2 to use my special ability, and L1 to break walls or smack things in the face with the butt of my gun. Simple, right? It's an effective control scheme and works very well.\n\n[b]Final Thoughts[/b]\n==========\nNeon Chrome is an excellent rogue-like/twin stick shooter. Challenging, fun, and in my opinion one of the better games to come out last year.

Our first several attempts were cut short as we constantly grenaded each other.  As we became familiar with what the heck was going on and actually communicated, we progressed steadily.  We each fell into niche classes and roles.  Him with the Assassin and stealth, while I charged around wrecking any and everything as the Cyber Psycho.  After the second and third Overseer our process had become...methodical.  We learned the way the AI operated in enough circumstances that we could trap them minimize our damage taken, and...cruel as it sounds....it was fun.  Running those poor bastards into un-winnable situations where we waited, weapons at the ready.  We fell out of Neon Chrome after maxing our upgrades and unlocking everything (except for the last Cyberware...which I STILL don't have....dammit)  and we moved on to other projects.  However, Overseer 4.0 sat there in his chair....mocking me.  I had made it to floor 23 on a solo run...I could get him...I could kill him.  I obsessed over getting enough credits to fund a maxxed out run from the bottom to the top.  If I was going to overthrow that maniacal a**....I was going to do it right.   And I did.  But then there was overseer 5, and 6....Now I am 56 hours deep and I have met with my greatest foe.\n\nOverseer 8.  He has consistently shut me down with waves upon waves of troops, and a Caretaker that seems nigh indestructable.  This game truly is just a series of processes to me now.  I have reached the point in this game where others stop seeming fun, and yet I play on.

The music is that haunting, ballad-esque outrun style that almost tells a short story on it's own with no lyrics. The atmosphere is grim and entertaining without becoming too repetitive. The combat is awesome for a twin-stick style shooter. \n\nIt's a \"roguelike\" as we've come to know them; get as far as you can while collecting money to buy upgrades to get as far as you can next time. Though this one handles the story aspect of a loop in a sort of clever way, and you can basically swap between your \"NG\" and \"NG+[...]\" status before each run if you want. \n\nThere's a large variety of weapons each with their own qualities that you may like or not, and from what I can tell they are all balanced very well. The only aspect that doesn't quite make sense to me is the DPS calculation you see when you compare weapons, which you do by standing over one  you could pick up. Say weapon A has a higher rate of fire, a higher base damage, and a higher crtit chance, but a lower \"level,\" sometimes the DPS will show as less than weapon B for some reason. Maybe I'm missing something. \n\nThe combat is incredibly satisfying. Burst fire weapons, shotguns, etc, they have an impact. I don't know if it's just visual or if it's the visual combined with the immense ramping of damage that comes with hitting multiple shots for X damage and crit modifiers and seeing enemies just drop, but it feels really good. the maneuvering is great, the AI sort of works like a time-warped stealth mechanic in other games. If humans lose you, they drop pursuit and sort of pathfind around less intently which allows you to lure them if you need to, and their pathfinding in general allows you to slip them. IE: dart around a corner and double back through a hallway to end up behind them before they get to the corner, and sometimes this is absolutely necessary.\n\n When you do things like this it just feels really good, from picking up the loot to meleeing a rocket out of the air at the last second, this is basically a twin-stick shooter in the Shadowrun universe, unofficially, but even without the \"outrun\" style it would be a damn good twin-stick on it's own.", "timestamp_created": 1484165034, "timestamp_updated": 1484165034, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500389", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29189842": {"recommendationid": "29189842", "author": {"steamid": "76561197973973830", "num_games_owned": 187, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 18556, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3059, "last_played": 1514344328}, "language": "english", "review": "Loving the game!

When hunting variably nonsensical objects around a gorgeously produced, big-budget-world starts losing its' flair. A time when the easy infinite death->rebirth of most modern games begs the question: if nothing happens when i die, then why try to stay alive? \n\nAll of these issues are solved with one simple, indie, twin stick shooter. This game will make you remember why skill matters in a single player game (though it's got co-op here too, if that's your speed). Though you'll quickly find satisfaction in the simple design, the geniusly paced levels and excellent boss encounters; it's the inclusion of the roguelike feedback loop of progression that sells it for me.  That loop involves levelling aspects of your randomly rolled, cheekily named and classed character that are permanent to the game regardless of how far you made it last game, the cash you had upon death and the unlocks you discovered during your play will carry onto the next avatar.  All of this happens automatically while blasting fools and leveling your weapons (which happens per run), and while the levels seem to be 'seeded' in such a way, they still manage to feel designed by hand rather than tossed together by a ruleset.  All of this makes each play feel fresh and accomplished and satisfying, and every tense moment worthwhile.  Reaching another checkpoint between \"chapters\" automatically unlocks access to warp at the beginning of your next run from that level or any other previous level, these chapters at first last first 5 levels, then get longer as you get further into the game.  Just a few days in and i can already feel myself becoming more strategic in my approaches.  If you have played roguelike games then you know what i'm talking about, but if not,  the important takeaway is that you never feel like you start from the same spot essentially, in addition to the levels rerolling the sense of progress carried from one playthrough to the next is tweaked so that you can always have another leap in levels within reach, all the while managing to communicate via simple skill improvements that you're always getting better and more capable.\n\nBeing one of those AAA addicts that i mentioned in the first paragraph, it's so refreshing to find an honest, skill-based shooter that leans on the generous side of rewarding, keeping things lively from the first moment until you realize you've spent half a day playing one game.  \n\nBought it on sale, had i known it was this well designed and downright FUN, i would've gladly paid double. I know it's a small game, I know it looks a little silly even in some of the screenshots, but believe me none of these things matter once you get into the game, it harkens back to a standard you probably completely forgot, tasting overall a bit like the cyberpunk offspring of 'Gauntlet' and 'Smash TV'.  After a handful of unexpectedly engaging marathon sessions, you'll still be asking yourself: \"why is it that some great games are barely on the radar, while other bloatedly shiny yet mediocre ones hog the limelight so often?\" \n\nCheck this game out if you're a fan of rewarding arcade-style twinstick shooters that keep you hooked.  Best budget purchase in my library in YEARS.

Now, no one element is going to blow you away here, but this is a package deal: as the combination of all the gameplay elements makes for a \u201cone more run\u201d experience. Strategy actually plays a big part in the game: as being able to bust through walls and flank for double damage is key in not taking damage, and using the environment's explosives will do a lot to take down big groups of enemies....and maybe destroy some upgrades in the process. While the game isn't taking any awards home visually, it focuses on the action and is able to deliver with steady controls, and a reasonable difficulty. Now look, it doesn't have the unique pull of games like Binding of Isaac: Rebirth or the production value of Enter The Gungeon, but what it brings is a fun experience that you can play repeatedly, and something that I'll want to continue playing (well, at least if I wasn't reviewing so many other games as well.....). \n\n\n[b]Video Review: [/b]  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-X0izeGKfg\n\n[u] Lists: [/u]\n[b]Positives:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Destructible Environments have a direct effect on strategy and gameplay, and aren't there just for show. Flanking is vastly important, and really adds a whole another layer to gameplay.\n[*] Surprising, but the lack of a burst movement option actually feels like a breathe of fresh air for the genre. A focusing on aiming and accuracy and base movement is a nice change up from the dodge mechanics I'm seeing in a lot of games lately. \n[*] Reinforcements actually mean something in this game. It's not just 2/3 enemies, you get an entire army after you. Have fun with running for your life!\n[*] Good weapon system, in particular with the finding of weapons in the environment. Like the fact that you always seem to be improving, and not finding garbage weapons.\n[*] Progression system makes you want to reach further and further into the game. You're always getting stronger, which in the context of the game, actually makes a lot of sense. \n[*] Replayability is high, even if there's repetitive elements. Game keeps pressure on you with different events, and content is dropped as a reasonable rate to keep things fresh.\n[*] Basic structure of the story adds a good backdrop to the gameplay. It's not the star, but it complements what's here.\n[/list]\n\n[b]Negatives:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Visually not impressive. There's some blur effects that don't do the game justice, but the pulled back perspective may be a bit too far back. Hard to get some detail.\n[*] Needs more visual variance for some of the levels, as it can get old to look at the same elements at times.\n[*] Certain abilities/bosses need some balance, in particular with the rechargable shields. \n[/list]\n", "timestamp_created": 1480083316, "timestamp_updated": 1480083316, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.536895", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27325895": {"recommendationid": "27325895", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031467744", "num_games_owned": 184, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 4478, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494158978}, "language": "english", "review": "Really fun game with lots of replay value. So far no two runs have been alike. The \"rouge leagacy\" setting made me eager to go an explore.

The different classes hacker, assassin, soldier, techie and (my favorite) cyber psycho also make the playstyle a little different so you can enjoy another angle to the desctruction.\n\nFor me the graphics appears better than in the screenshots and the video. And its true - you can lay waste and destroy almost anything on the map which is just appropriate for the really well-implemented cyberpunk setting. This includes also the music of the game, which I enjoy a lot, too.\n\nI recommend the game to anyone who is into cyberpunk and/or twin-stick shooters.

Fuck that. Let me darn my fanboy garments right now!\nThat game! THAT game!\nYeah, it's your typical procedurally generated dual stick shooter surfing the Isaac wake. Yeah it's got that retro 80s look that's all the craze, up to the (spunky) synthwave soundtrack.\nWhat is not captured by the screen grabs is how great the weapons feel. How cool they sound. How their pitch goes up when running out of ammo, so you don't have to look down at a counter to evaluate your situation. How the same is true for your adversaries. How the action will escalate to mind-blowing levels of mayhem as you progress in the later levels. How you can build up your own class through skills and weapons you pick up. How stealth is an option. How the constantly rewarding progression makes you feel like you didn't waste time, even doing a terrible run. How the game saves your progress transparently.\nBut especially, how so damn cool it is to walk back through the path of destruction you carved up, pretty much anything being destructible. That alone is a reward of its own.\n \nI am ecstatic. This is one of those few games that get pretty much everything right. When the basis are this stable, such level of attention to details is just heartwarming.", "timestamp_created": 1479209215, "timestamp_updated": 1479209215, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.716112", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26612863": {"recommendationid": "26612863", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085575027", "num_games_owned": 164, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 111, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1465465172}, "language": "english", "review": "-All Aboard the Cyberpunk Train!-\n\nGet ready to climb ladder of the future! You play as an asset, here to stop the evil Overseer - A controlling AI that is the mind of Neon Chrome. In this future, complete and absolute trust is required to have the luxury of residing in said Neon Chrome. Once the Overseer caught wind of your sentience, well, you're simply marked for 'removal'. Teams of baddies, not to mention their robot machine-gun counterparts will stop at nothing to carry out exactly what the twisted leader demands. \n\nThere are no two ways about it, Neon Chrome is absolutely visually stunning. I cannot express how gorgeous and sleek everything looks from the start up screen, to the actual gameplay. The menus are slick and make you feel like you're completely immersed. Loading times are notably fast too--some of the quickest I've ever seen. If you're like me, and are just waiting in line for your next go at dying, this softens the blow and starts to desensitize you. Coupled with the safe room, where you get to upgrade, tweak and choose your next character, the game makes sure you start with confidence. But the higher you climb the cyberpunk rungs, the more expensive it all becomes. \n\n-A Different Experience Every Time-\n\nNeon Chrome has a unique level loader that randomizes every situation. Unlike Hotline Miami, where you can master every move and learn to own a level down to a centimeter--this game will move it all around and switch layouts up to keep you on your toes. As Neon Chrome is the towering skyscraper of Neon Corp, this special randomization feature makes you feel like you really are climbing your way through a never-ending building. \n\nAfter Guardian of Light, I became a massive fan of the twin stick shooting genre. This is a game that makes sure you get all the fun squeezed out of it too. It's fast and reflexive. I won't lie, I'm not very good at this game, but it doesn't change the fact that I enjoyed every minute of playing it. Perhaps the Overseer got the best of my assets time and time again, but I can assure you good reader, that this little engine that could will keep coming back for the pain. Since every new turn is such a drastic change from the last, the monotony of playing the same thing over and over is completely broken up. Your assets are different people with endlessly different abilities. Each level is packed with exploding bits of environment, locked doors, keymasters and upgrading stations. No shortage of weaponry here, they've clearly strived to make nothing seem repetitive, which is a huge win for any game.\n\n-The Future Is Well-Maintained-\n\nAside from it's being a great game as it is, it seems like the developers are constantly listening and improving on what is already something amazing. Being in touch with their fanbase, they've lowered the difficulty of the bosses, giving everyone a fair fight with more health pickups and tweaking the upgrade system to better suit our needs. Something neat that was also mentioned was the use of mods and how they're very actively supporting them (at your own risk!) to the point where it's easily accessible through the main menu. It's been mentioned that support could be implemented to make them more stable, but this would be pending on the sales of the game itself. \n\nFrom the mind melting visuals that will leave your brain salivating, to the haunting, hallow voice of the Overseer--this game will satisfy your lust to take down an evil corporation of the future. You'll enjoy tailored gameplay that runs like a well-oiled machine with this one--it's not to be missed! -ChickenSupreme/Gamesxtreme.com", "timestamp_created": 1479204493, "timestamp_updated": 1479204493, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26594092": {"recommendationid": "26594092", "author": {"steamid": "76561198092964824", "num_games_owned": 185, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 821, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487770470}, "language": "english", "review": "Honestly an outstanding game, 74/100 metacritic is a bit low.

Whatever you do, even if you manage to survive only a few levels, you will have the chance to upgrade your skills.\n\nThe upgrades to your character on every run also add spice to the story.\n\nThe gameplay is not reflex-based, more tactical, it is about knowing your enemies and types of weapons and secondary weapons. The bosses are also become less and less difficulty as your character improves, but they still stay challenging.\n\nIt is also good either for short bursts or for longer sessions.\n\nThe levels are procedurally generated, and that keeps the replayability basically endless. They are not too small (like in Forced: Showdown), not too large either, so there is enough place for tactical movement.\n\nIn overall: it is a great game for casual gamers, who would like to see their efforts not in vain (I look at you: roguelikes with lose-everything permadeath), also has a nice soundtrack and atmosphere.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1477056701, "timestamp_updated": 1477056701, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516781", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26048154": {"recommendationid": "26048154", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035142721", "num_games_owned": 81, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 661, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502131688}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is a blast!

Spread lead shells into the unsuspecting guards and scurry behind walls before they blast you down.\n\nFight epic bosses, use walls as cover then cry as it is melted down by their weapon fire and you must find somewhere else to recharge your weapon.\n\nIt belongs up there with the other top shelf 2d shooters.\n\nPros:\nWASD with mouse movement and full controller support.\nPlenty of upgrades and unlocks.\nPlenty of hours to the gameplay.\nDie and spend loot to build a better you.\nDeath is fair. Come back stronger and better equipped.\nTime when and how to engage the enemy. \nLearn how to trigger traps and stay alive.\n'Eat recycled food, it's great for the environment and ok for you.' - Judge Dredd.\n\nCons:\nNothing innovative.\nScreen is a bit busy and takes some play time to decipher what's what.\nStart again from level 1.\nNot as intense as others in the genre.\nGraphics aren't super exciting if you're into that kind of thing.\n\nSimilar games:\nIt's cheap to compare games but it's a fast way to understand how a game plays.\n\nCrimsonland - Neon Chrome is the successor to the cult-hit Crimsonland. A new environment of rooms and corridors, similar functions yet better AI, looting and quests to it's predecessor.\n\nMonaco: What's Yours Is Mine - The ambience, movement, the use of weapons, hacking, this plays like a shooter version of Monaco. Stealth is used more here to determine where and how to engage the enemy.\n\nHotline Miami - This is the base comparison for 2d shooters in close quarters. Neon Chrome is less frantic and has a larger view of the kill field. It's not as visceral but to me that makes it less jarring. The screen is busier and there's more to do with a destructive environment around you.\n\nRogue Legacy - Game difficulty curve, upgrades at castle and death cycle are similar to Rogue Legacy.\n\n8.5/10.", "timestamp_created": 1472203963, "timestamp_updated": 1472204007, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25157608": {"recommendationid": "25157608", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069837727", "num_games_owned": 182, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1435, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502671483}, "language": "english", "review": "!", "timestamp_created": 1472199998, "timestamp_updated": 1483511069, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25082434": {"recommendationid": "25082434", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983964763", "num_games_owned": 127, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 2257, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1473877806}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun times!!

I'll try to explain the game, as well as why I don't care for it, then you can make your choice based on the kind of player you are.\n\nSo, I love twin stick shooters. All the way back to playing Robotron 2084 in the arcades as a kid. I also really enjoyed 10tons last twin stick shooter as well, Crimsonland, which I've got on GOG. \n\nMy thing is, when I play a twin stick, I want something fast and frenetic... something like Robotron, Crimsonland, Geometry Wars, Enter the Gungeon, Nuclear Throne... \"my problem\" with this game is pacing. It's almost like this just happens to be a twin stick controlled game, but isn't really supposed to be what you'd generally think of as a \"twin stick shooter.\"\n\nIn this game you're in cramped hallways and small rooms, and it often-times feels more as if it should be a top down stealth game as opposed to what it is. Although many times the AI is so dumb, stealth won't matter. A few times I've shot a soldier standing beside another, and his partner doesn't even react. Or missed and bullets fired right past them, but they just keep \"guarding\".\n\nThe easiest way to sum this up is: Take Crimsonland, give it a neon, Bladerunner-esqe ambiance, an awesome soundtrack, and put it into cramped, mazelike quarters, shake in a little \"rogue-lite\" and you've got Neon Chrome. It's got the powerups and guns you find like Crimsonland. The bit of humor in their written summaries. Even the menu screens remind me of Crimsonland... The only thing this game doesn't have is all the fast action fun.\n\nIf you want a bit more thoughtful, strategic twin stick shooter as opposed to your typical fun run 'n gun, definitely give this a try. It's got slick graphics, a GREAT soundtrack, and decent controls (I used an XBOX One controller while I played). And in some ways it does make you think a little more than probably any other twin stick I've played (how to navigate the levels, etc.) but be aware that may ruin the pacing of the game for you as well.\n\nAll in all, I personally found it to be... not bad. Just not fast, not firing out both barrels... and not fun.", "timestamp_created": 1471762421, "timestamp_updated": 1471762421, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25042629": {"recommendationid": "25042629", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046111769", "num_games_owned": 577, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 42, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472177242}, "language": "english", "review": "So far, it's like they took Crimsonland, dipped it into a vat of cyberpunk, and left it all twin stick shootery. \n\nSo, you know, probably going to be playing a lot of this.

I had my doubts at first, it being a small game, but let me assure you, it's well worth the price. \n\nGAMEPLAY: Typical twin stick shooter action in this one. It is a roguelike, so there is an additional exra element of difficulty involved from the get-go. You have a variety of classes with different starting perks, and randomized weapons/assets to pick from before diving into the levels. Each one is randomized as well, so you never play the game the same way twice. Combat is intense and grabs you by the face and forces you to pay attention. You can choose from a variety of ways to play, whether tactical or guns'a blazin' and you can pull off wins either way, depending on how you fight. The level of creativity this game allows was quite a treat for me. \nThe item that stuck out most for me in this game, is that the difficulty is not impossible, but not a walk-in-the-park either. It's just enough to challenge you, and make the game fun. Boss fights in particular make sure you don't get too uppity and feel too good about yourself. \n\nGENERAL: Graphics are very good, and definitely catch the eye. As the title somewhat suggests, there's a lot of bright neon lights thrown throughout levels and just as added detail to make the environment enjoyable. Audio is amazing. Music is nice (can get repetitive after a bit, but I find it useful to just turn off the in-game music and play my own in the background), and the combat sounds (such as grenades exploding and guns firing) are top-notch. Very satisfying to hear. \n\nCONCLUSION AND EXTRA NOTES: All in all, an amazing game, that will be sure to get you to waste a lot of time on. I didn't expect Neon Chrome to be all that great, in all honesty. However, I was very pleasantly surprised. The devs went above and beyond for this one, and really highlighted on all the gameplay and audio stuff that really gets me into the feel of the games I love. 9/10 cannot recommend enough.\nNOTES: Multiplayer is kinda funky. The game apparently supports up to 4 players, but I have only managed to get 2 player co-op on my PC, as only one of our controllers is recognized by the game. However, the co-op experience is very good as well.

Every five floors is a boss battle which once beaten, allows you to take an elevator directly to the next floor on any future runs.\nI really enjoyed the graphics, style and setting of this game, making it one of my favourite cyberpun games at the moment.\nI would prefer if controls had the option to always walk towards the cursor and strafe around it instead of always moving relative to the screen as I feel this makes top down shooters easier to control.", "timestamp_created": 1467285545, "timestamp_updated": 1467285545, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499659", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23914030": {"recommendationid": "23914030", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970724214", "num_games_owned": 769, "num_reviews": 87, "playtime_forever": 1593, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468524835}, "language": "english", "review": "In Neon Chrome you are a hacker that uses cyborg \"assets\" to wage an internal war inside of an archology. The game is a top-down roguelike, and thusly things are randomized quite a bit. The player progresses through floors full of enemies, upgrades and containers to loot looking for cash and weapons on their warpath to the top of the tower. \n\nEach time a \"run\" is started, you pick a character out of three, each with a different role, weapon and ability. Weapons and abilities can be swapped out during your run if you find something more suitable, but roles will determine quite a bit of your playstyle. For instance: hackers can open purple boxes and use purple terminals that will allow them to possible collect more loot, while assassins are able to hide in the shadows and go unseen. A lot of weapons fall under the SMG/assault rifle/burst rifle/shotgun heirarchy, but there are also grenade launchers, rail guns, rocket launchers, heavy pistols and some other fun toys. As you loot more weapons, the weapon \"level\" increases. You will always find better guns up until the point you reach the top, or, less desirably: die.\n\nIn death, however, not all is lost. Your asset is left behind, a stain on one of the floors of game's namesake. The cash you earned is the real prize. This cash can go into upgrading your assets' health, damage, luck, energy and how many cybernetic upgrades they can have, along with puchasing previously found weapons and upgrades to have them from the start of a fresh run. These upgrades are never lost, and you eventually become a powerhouse.\n\nThe floors are randomly generated, and while sometimes you will recognize some \"tiles\", the placement is often pretty well done and I didn't get a \"samey\" feeling that tends to creep up on roguelikes that make use of tiles for map generation. One of the more interesting mechanics is that many walls, \"thin\" walls, are able to be shot through with any weapon. Some weapons will take a few shots, but there's nothing quite like firing a rail gun through a wall, nailing three or four guys in the process. In addition to this, there are some special levels that are accessed by taking an alternative exit. These levels are hand crafted mini challenges that are a fun way to break up the randomized mayhem, some of them even being puzzles of sorts. The goal of the top floor takes about an hour, depending on how thorough you are and how many special levels you take on.\n\nOnce you reach the end of Neon Chrome, all is not as it appears. The cycle continues, only this time enemies are harder, the layouts are more cluttered with mines, and the loot is more enticing. Your character, which seemed powerful, is now no longer shredding enemies, and the quest to upgrade even more starts anew.\n\nThe music and sound design are very good and fit the cyberpunk theme/artstyle very well. There is some voice acting, and it's not bad. Overall, it's a tight, well-made experience.\n\nThere is local coop, but I didn't have a chance to try it. There is no plan to include net multiplayer, so if that's a dealbreaker I would skip out on it (though NVidia's gameshare may be a way around that).\n\nTL;DR: I highly recommend this game.", "timestamp_created": 1467172832, "timestamp_updated": 1467172913, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.571971", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23910954": {"recommendationid": "23910954", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991690555", "num_games_owned": 4400, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 4231, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467948913}, "language": "english", "review": "This is one of those rare, wonderful games that can be nearly imposible to stop playing, simply because you're having such an incredible time.

You come across a slight hiccup in this relationship! You see, the Overseer believes that trust is a two way street, but it seems that you have been red carded and you have just been put on a Removal Status. There is only one thing to do; make your way to the top of the tower and tell the Overseer what you really think about your removal standing. Show him who you are! \n\nOh, just before you start, let me wish you good luck. . . I think you might need it!\n\nNeon Chrome is top-down shooter set in a cyberpunk tower with some roguelike elements to it.  At the start of the game, you will find yourself in Lab 13 of the Neon Chrome tower. There you will learn how to play and what to look for. As you go through this small but comprehensive tutorial, you will end up in front of a massive screen where the Overseer will explain to you that there is no point to try to eliminate him! In this instance, he will be quite right, as you will be defeated in this hall by strong corporate soldiers.\n\nNext, you will wake up on the immersion chair (a pod)! From here, you will be starting a quest to kill the Overseer. As you become familiar with your operation base, you will notice several options available to you while moving north. The first five options are all about upgrading your characteristics, such as your health, weapon damage, luck, energy and ability slots. The only bugger is that all of them cost money to increase your character levels. \n\nThe ability slots can only be purchased ten times, but the other four characteristics go all the way to one hundred. Need to learn how to save, I\u2019d say! A couple of steps further north, and you can choose (pay) which weapons, enhancements and abilities you would like in order to start your next attempt. They will all be listed but you will need to find them during gameplay to be able to select them in your next turn. \n\nWhen you are done with this, just make your way back to the chair. Sitting comfortably? Great, now three options will come up on the screen and you will have to choose the style of your character. Are you going to be a hacker, a techie, a cyborg or an assassin? Having chosen your character, you will enter the body via a neural link. The lucky winner will raised from his capsule, which is located in the nearby hibernation vault, and off you go! \n\nWhat you have to do is to find the elevator to get to the next floor. However, it is not going to be easy as you will have to deal with robots, corporate soldiers, mines, pivoting laser beams and other obstacles. For your first couple of games, your weapons will not inflict as much damage as you would desire. So make sure to take as much money as you can. Money is represented by these yellow rectangles which drop every time you kill an enemy, but can also be found in crates with a blue or yellow circle on them. Crates with a purple circle can only be opened by hackers, and hold bigger loots. The blue rectangle will recharge your secondary weapons, so do not hesitate to accumulate them.\n \nYou might come across a weapons crate, which will give you better weapons. Weapon upgrade capsules are harder to find but if you do, try to reach them by any means. There are vertical capsules too; when you access them you can add a special ability to your character. If you need to regenerate your health, find a health table. They are quite rare and can only be used once. In some levels, you might find an elevator shaft, which is only for the use of the Neon Chrome military personnel. There are additional levels within a level, and they hold spectacular goodies, but are slightly more challenging. During the gameplay, you can destroy most things within each level, which is really fun! When you die, you wake up in your comfy chair with hopefully a great stack of money to spend, and additional weaponry, too.\n\nIn the solo game, you have 28 levels to clear and this is without the sub levels that I mentioned above. You can also play local co-op, up to 4 people.\n\nIn regards to the controls, either gamepad or mouse and keyboard are really responsive. The graphics could have been better, in my opinion.\n\nI think the best aspect in this game is the randomised levels (with the exception of the bosses\u2019 levels) which give you great replay-ability.\n\nPositives:\n~~~~~~~  \n\n-\tRandomized levels \n-\tGood selections of weapons and abilities\n-\tYou can destroy just about everything in each level\n-\tInteresting enemies\n-\tSolo and local co-op modes\n-\tGreat replay-ability\n-\tGood controls\n-\tAchievements and trading cards\n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~\n\n-\tGraphics could have been better\n\nNeon Chrome is a really good, addictive top-down shooter - a really worthwhile game to own.

I feel my time would be better spent elsewhere.\n\nEdit: Going back in, I still believe the bosses are ridiculous, but the game still has some real shining points. While I think they could have been better designed, ultimately they don't destroy the whole product. 7/10", "timestamp_created": 1464915093, "timestamp_updated": 1464961811, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23302046": {"recommendationid": "23302046", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034019268", "num_games_owned": 303, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 786, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467618609}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a good game and its thanks to dedicated Devs like this.

The game is set in a sci-fi cyberpunk structure throughout the game which really sets the mood of the game and the enemies also.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nThe game itself starts you off being chased through Neon Chrome, the mighty overseer doesn't trust you anymore and trust is what the society Neo Chrome is built upon. You get caught and you wake up in a Total Recall chair from your latest failed attempt to take down the overseer. But you have many more chances to get this overseer and kill him. The game itself revolves around you trying to kill the overseer, progressing through floors whilst killing enemies along the way and trying not to die as you get through these enemies. But if you die, it's okay because you can just reconnect to another pod and try again through the floors. After getting through 4-6 floors you will come across a boss room, if you are able to kill this boss without dying then you will be able to respawn at that floor with the pods.\n\nThe game follows the general rogue-like elements throughout, with the general arsenal assault rifles, SMGS, shotguns ect. All of these general weapons have their stats from attack damage to range. When you die and get reconnected to another pod, you will have a special randomly selected special active ability that you can use as you shoot through your enemies. One of these special abilities can be shooting a rocket at your enemies doing extensive amounts of damage than normal weapons, you will have to use these abilities in order to survive through the tower.\n\nBut the game really shines through the destructible environment and the amount of strategy that is included throughout the game. With the game having a sort of strategy side to it, you will have to take advantage of the destructible environment in order to shoot enemies from behind which does double damage as long as they don't detect you. Being able to destroy walls and take advantage of the this will make you be able to get through the level with minimal damage taken.\n\nThe enemy AI isn't exactly the smartest, you can kind of manipulate them to your advantage and kill them easier than you are intended to. But, with most of the enemies being fully aggressive they can give you some problems if they start surrounding you and hitting/shooting you. The game can sometimes make the game from slow to really fast paced sending in reinforcements making for some really great gameplay. These reinforcements aren't just some normal guys that come running at you, there is about 15-20 of them shooting at you and throwing grenades all at once making the game fairly difficult at times.\n\nThe game, as it is a roguelike, is suppose to be difficult and ruthless throughout. The smallest mistake in the game can cost you the current run especially when it comes to the boss fights and explosives that will make you lose quickly. The health is scarce throughout, as you will struggle to find health when you need it the most.\n\nThe game does a good job with the currency of the game that you will find as you play through each of the floors. Exploring through the floors will reward you with better weapons ect to make your characters more powerful. With the credits that you earn you will be able to up your stats by buying each of the upgrades, from your health to your attack damage.\n\nThis game seems to feature full controller support or keyboard controls. For me personally I would choose to use a keyboard and mouse, just for the better accuracy when you shoot enemies instead of a controller which doesn't have as much accuracy. The controls doesn't seem to include a invincibility frame such as a dodge roll, this also makes the game feel much better with keyboard and mouse.\n\nWith the graphic side of the game it isn't as impressive as it seems. The cyberpunk theme throughout the game does seem to get a bit boring after playing the game for a hour or so, everything starts to look the same with the same dark and light colour throughout. I think that more variety would really make the graphics look better.\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n+ General weapons\n+ Respawning you will get a different special ability\n+ Destructible environment\n+ Strategy i needed to survive\n+ Aggressive AI makes the game more difficult\n+ Lots of replay ability\n+ Ruthless and difficult gameplay\n+ Controller Support\n+ Steam trading cards and achievements\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n- AI could use some improvement\n- The graphics seem to let the game down a bit\n\n[h1]Result / Final Thoughts[/h1]\nSo the final verdict of the game, this game is a exceptional good roguelike cyberpunk game that has a lot of replay value and exploration value of the game. The game is ruthless and unforgiving at times, which just makes the game better all together making you need to be more precious with your shooting. The game seems to fall at it's kinda stupid AI and the same look of the graphics. Overall I would highly recommend this game to rogue-like/lite lovers!\n\n[b]Rating: 8.2/10[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1464307922, "timestamp_updated": 1464308050, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.549158", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23210059": {"recommendationid": "23210059", "author": {"steamid": "76561197962368462", "num_games_owned": 788, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 2472, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503420661}, "language": "english", "review": "best top-down shooter so far, just buy it !", "timestamp_created": 1464221286, "timestamp_updated": 1464221286, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502851", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23175090": {"recommendationid": "23175090", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039470092", "num_games_owned": 312, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 1028, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489725558}, "language": "english", "review": "Overall great game.

Since the very beginning of a game, players are greeted by an awesome soundtrack that will introduce you to the pace of the game. At first, the gameplay might look a bit chaotic and maybe even overwhelming, but once you'll get used to it, oh boy - the only thing you'll want to do is spread even more chaos! Or who knows, maybe you'll decide for a more sneakier path? It's all up to you!\n\n[b]Advantages[/b]\n[list]\n[*] - Excellent local co-op (max 4 players)\n[*] - Fenomenal and atmospheric soundtrack (I instantly fell in love with it, listen to Monopoly on Violence, it's just splendid <3)\n[*] - Difficult is hard enough to be entertained but not too hard to be raging at\n[*] - Controls are simple and perfect. Also, a great controller support (tested on XBOX 360 controller)\n[*] - Story is told \"on side\" as you're going through the game, no need to sit through long cutscenes / dialogues\n[*] - Huge variety of pre-made classes, upgrades, weapons and abilities to choose from\n[*] - Level design is awesome, mostly destructible surroundings and randomly generated levels gives the game quite a nice replay value\n[*] - Clever system that requires you to actually die to upgrade yourself and even progress the game\n[*] - Graphics are very nice looking and, surprisingly, quite neon. Cyberpunkish graphics rules!\n[*] - Constantly updated\n[/list]\n\n[b]Disadvantages[/b]\n[list]\n[*] - Graphics were somehow \"bugged\", I needed to level them down slightly due to blurriness\n[*] - Hopefully devs will add multiplayer at one point\n[/list]\n\n[b]Summary[/b]\nThis game is literally excellent and perfect. I might have not played a lot of it [u]yet[/u] (I'm a busy man, alright?) but I can't wait for the next time to get in and play it. It's also highly addictive, so far, I can't find any serious cons. Literally perfect. The replay value is great thanks to randomly generated levels and all those abilities and unlockables. Surroundings are nearly 100% destructible, so the only thing that stands in your way to burst through the wall into a room full of enemies is a wall that you'll need to take down! A.I. is not stupid, so don't worry, it's not one of those slashers where enemies just run at you, doing nothing. Story seems pretty good once you'll listen to it, hopefully I'll get to its end one day. One thing that surprised me is the diversity of all add-ons like combinations of weapons and abilities, unique abilities to specific characters and tons of upgrades you get going along the game - believe me, you'll have tons of fun looking for the best combination that fits your playstyle. One thing that would be nice is multiplayer, co-op or versus, it would be fun either way.\n[b]TL;DR[/b] Do I recommend it? Hell yeah, just get it and play, you won't regret it!\n\nPersonal score\n[table]\n[tr]\n[th]\n9.5 / 10\n[/th]\n[/tr]\n[/table]\n\n[i]If you find my review helpful or funny be sure to follow [b]Opium

The engine is perfect, and while I have a top of the line gaming rig, this also runs just fine my older gaming laptop and a $150 mini PC I purchased for media on my TV. It's very well designed, and I am guessing they'll just keep making it better. You will die. You will die a lot. It's the way the game is designed so well, that you won't be frustrated by it (at least I wasn't). It's a little confusing at first, but put some stats in \"luck\" so you'll get more loot, which will help you level up your other skills faster. I didn't read any guides for this game (although maybe I should have), but being able to hack the boxes with your character definitely helps at the beginning.

Not very many games a have succeeded in that, so hats off to them for that. It even keeps to the generally grey morality of many cyber punk games by having you play as a person who seems to [spoiler] hack into peoples brains in cryo sleep and use them as weapons until their utter demise [/spoiler]. \n\nThe gameplay itself is solid. There are a few classes that can be chosen from at the beginning of a run and, with money from previous runs, you can get premanent upgrades or purchase equipment for your next run. The combat is fun and there is a decent variety among the enemies. \n\nThe best part about the gameplay is the permanent pregression. (I personally think that) A rouge-like needs to have some form of permanent progression between runs, and Neon Chrome gets it down pat. The upgrades that you can purchase between runs is important, but everytime you beat a boss you will also be able to start from just after that battle. This negates the slough that so many rouge-likes have of fighting through earlier, weaker levels and repetative bosses.\n\nNeon Chrome feels like a nostalgia trip to old, top down arcade shooters.

And it is because they tease a deep-seated fear within us on some primal level, in that such a scenario could plausibly occur at some point in our lives as technology rapidly advances in the wrong hands - with the only hope remaining for humanity resting upon the wits of techno-savvy rebels who desperately seek to undermine & overthrow such a diabolical system of rule.\n  \nAnd so it was with great anticipation & delight that I took the opportunity to review this latest offering in the top-down twin-stick shooter genre, Neon Chrome, from the very same developer, 10tons Ltd, who brought us Crimsonland...a very laudable title in its own right. But were they able to capitalize on past experience and improve upon the formula by taking it to the next level with their newest title? My answer to this question is a resounding yes, on all counts, and so let's now further explore why this is actually so.   \n\nUpon starting this title up with a grin of anticipation, what immediately struck me was how artistically gorgeous it all was. Aesthetically, the game is spectacularly stylish indeed, exuding richly vibrant neon colors which seamlessly blend into each other very pleasingly...delighting the senses and imbuing a great sense of immersion within these scenes of both illuminated and shadowed areas...itself perhaps a meaningfully subtle metaphor in describing this battle of both light and darkness. Coupled with its atmospheric ambiance, there is a true feeling of depth below you, letting you know in no uncertain terms that you are gradually ascending higher & higher within this frightfully towering colossus for an epic showdown with the evil overlord who rules over all that is - the inscrutable Overseer.\n\nEssentially, your prime objective is to navigate your upgradable & cybernetically enhanced player around each floor with its many walls and maze-like paths, methodically sabotaging their defense systems and obliterating every ruthless minion or sophisticated robot you encounter, of which there are several uniquely different kinds to engage in battle with. The progression system here was rather well executed I thought, because there were numerous clearly defined challenges & goals to be achieved - complete with both bosses & mini-bosses found throughout. I felt a tremendous sense of accomplishment after each floor was reduced to rubble and no further enemies were left remaining to mercilessly hunt me down. It was both addicting and exhilarating to reach the next one higher (31 levels spread across 6 large floors incidentally) as I eagerly wondered what would be awaiting me to contend with when I arrived there. \n\nThe gameplay exudes a wonderful cadence, with moments of relative calm and strategizing as you consider your options, interspersed with sudden bursts of absolute mayhem as reinforcements mercilessly swarm you with incendiary explosions dancing all around your feet...inducing incredible adrenalin rushes as you desperately attempt to stave off this onslaught of malicious intent. And make no bones about it, the enemies in this game can be rather aggressive indeed...so planning is absolutely crucial for success here. And therein lies the true beauty of Neon Chrome, you must actually think ahead and plan your movements accordingly as opposed to mindlessly running & gunning around aimlessly. Thus a thoughtful strategy for attack is the key to success here, as opposed to impetuous and impatient tactics being employed, making for a vastly more enriching experience upon its floors of procedurally generated levels.\n\nOn a side-note, I must say that the enemy AI is neither superior nor wholly inadequate in my opinion - instead being found somewhere in between at the decent range. It can be exploited somewhat, but only to a limited degree since they tend to relentlessly hunt you down sooner or later. \n\nAnother positive attribute to be found here was the bountiful number of both powerful weapons & cybernetic abilities (unlockable) as well as diverse character classes (selectable) that could be deployed, each with their own specific strengths and weaknesses, ensuring that every single run-through was a deeply satisfying & uniquely memorable experience. I greatly enjoyed testing out their inherent abilities against my foes, continually dialing in the optimal setup for each challenging situation that I was presented with. \n\nAnd to further expand upon this point, the environment is actually destructible which beneficially helps the game. And so for example, if you are unable to enter an area from the front entrance, then why not blast your way in from the side and make your own pathway forward utilizing brute force. This is yet another definite plus in the gameplay, injecting an additional layer of fun possibilities to the equation.\n\nNow in regard to the background music, it was perfectly matched to the look and feel of the game, and consists of an edgy yet gratifying electronic tune that is endlessly looped...masterfully evoking a brooding tension in the air. \n\nI did however have a very minor gripe with the camera height, in that it seemed to be quite a ways above the action...sometimes making it a bit tricky to discern detail. Of course, it's always a trade-off in that a lower height would reveal less of the gameplay area. Nonetheless, at times it did seem a touch too high up I thought. Ideally, it would be fantastic if it were dynamically adjustable in-game, so as to allow the player to set their own preference at any given moment. But again, this is a relatively minor quibble overall as the current setting is still very much within the limits of what is acceptable.\n\nThankfully, this title has been fully Steamified with both achievements and trading cards included. Furthermore, it is designed for both single-player and local co-op...meaning no online play...which may or may not be an issue depending upon your own personal preference. For me, I simply view it as an intriguing single-player game to journey inside of.\n\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\n\nSo alas the burning question remains, is it worth procuring?\n\nWhile Neon Chrome doesn't do anything exceedingly ground-breaking or revolutionary, what it does do it does superbly well, sticking to tried & true gameplay ideas & mechanics wrapped inside a very pretty package...one where the supraliminal exploration of this unnerving dichotomy between freedom versus tyranny inside of a futuristic cyberpunk setting has never been so much fun. And thus I would wholeheartedly recommend it as a very worthy addition to one's library for fans of this genre at its very reasonable new release price, while confidently rating it at a solid 4/5 stars. \n\n[b]For similar reviews and great giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1462396315, "timestamp_updated": 1462415275, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6,

bit farther. So far I've only gotten to the Hovertank, but I'm definitely enjoying it.\nEdit: I've beaten it for the first time, so I can make some of these things a little more accurate. \n\nThe Tl;Dr is that this game is a Cyberpunk Rogue Legacy with a \"linear\" map progression. I say linear map progression, because you generally have to go to floor 1, then 2, etc, but the floors are different every time. \n\nFor everyone else, it's a top down rogue like shooter. You play as super hacker who is trying to take down an evil corportation. You do this by sitting in a chair, picking a bot/person from a list, and sending them forth into the levels. You get to pick from three different people that are random. The more weapons and abilities you find, the more diverse your picks can become. There are also static upgrades, so you can give your units more health, energy, luck, damage, etc. These are static upgrades, if you get em, they stay. You can also buy a weapon, that you've unlocked, and you'll start with it on your next run, same with abilities. \nAnother neat thing I noticed was that completing achievements nets you in game money. It's not a lot, but 1200 credits can still be a few levels, depending on how early in the game you are. \nThis game can feel a little grindy, but that's the just nature of the rogue like. \nA small note is that this game felt VERY weird to me initially. The controls are very simple, but there is no dodge, which I thought was weird.

Steam must be counting all the time the application has been running to come up with the 14h I'm seeing.\n\nEDIT:  play time is now around triple the first review's\n\nPros:  \n- Good amount of options in weapons and ability loadouts\n- Good balance overall - even if you get to a point where you're a killing most enemies with 1 shot, there are elements to keep it from becoming a cakewalk\n- Story fits my playstyle --  I don't want to be bored to tears by a novel of backstory.  I came to play a game, not read a book.  This game has exactly the right amount of forced story, imo.  And for me, it doesn't hurt that it's a sci-fi with Shadowrun-style elements.\n- Although similar, it's softened the edges of the grind/hardcore components that Rogue Legacy has, which means I might actually play to completion!\n\nCons:  \n- seriously why so blurry?  reminds me of old days CRT monitors going bad, which likely means it's causing eye strain and honestly makes me believe it could be harmful\n**the blurriness can be lessened significantly (but by no means eliminated) by disabling dynamic resolution - at least on some monitors?\n\nEDIT: the blurriness can indeed be removed as the dev kindly replied.  i had tried disabling options 1-by-1.  i should've tried all off and selected one at a time.  it's the combination of disabling \"dynamic resolution\" and the \"post processing filter\" that makes the game as crisp as can be.\n\n- i could be wrong but i fought the 2nd boss 4 times so far and have come to the conclusion that the fight is vastly more difficult than 3rd and 4th bosses + just about requires that you have unlocked one of a small number of abilities that are viable for the final evolution\n\nEDIT: i played back through a few times on 1.0 and 2.0 overseer levels (if you haven't yet played the game, overseer levels basically = going back through from level 1 on increasingly higher difficulty) and i no longer notice such a large discrepancy with 2nd boss.  however i will still say that regardless of loadout (which makes a huge difference), starting with greatest difficulty i rank the bosses at 5-2-3-4-1.  not a huge deal, just expected a progression since it is a linear path (unlike, say, megaman games where there was also a discrepancy in boss difficulty but you could go to any world in any order).  still, i don't know what anyone else's opinion is on this matter and this part boils down to an opinion.\n\n- ***MINOR SPOILER ABOUT AN ENHANCEMENT***\n***\n***\n***\n***\n***\n***\n***\n***\n***\n***\n***\n***\n\"Nanoedge Chameleon Skin\" has a description of \"You are undetectable while stationary\".

I am so stoked to rack up some hours in this game.  I am a big fan of the 80's aesthetic and this game absolutely NAILS it.  The visuals have this cyberpunk vibe to them and the world outside the walls looks like it was ripped straight out of \"BladeRunner\", in a GOOD way!  The soundtrack is also wonderfully 80's and fits perfectly.  I really enjoy roguelikes, but one thing that irks me is the lack of feeling like you progressed.  \"Neon Chrome\" negates this by letting you collect loot to spend as permenant upgrades to your runs.  Along with this in your runs you can unlock new weapons to find permanently and a \"Nuclear Throne\" style temporary run upgrade system as well.  The levels are unique and randomly generated.  Every five levels there is a shortcut added too after you beat the challenging boss, if you are into that.

Yes. I curtsey to Crimsonland. Thank you.\n\n\nDo you enjoy Top-Down shooters? This is the game for you. Allow me to explain why.\n\n[h1]Graphics:[/h1]\n:::::Set in a futuristic Neon Cyberpunk and Blade-Runner-esq world, Neon Chrome is a pleasure to play. This game offers beautiful colors, particles, glow (not overdone) and polish. \n\n[h1]Soundtrack:[/h1]\n:::::Cyberpunk and almost 80's-esq, my hats off to the composer/producer - you nailed it. I found myself zoning out to the beats and tunnel-visioned while my ears were serenaded. \n\n[h1]Gameplay:[/h1]\n::::In this game you can upgrade your stats such as Damage, Health, Luck, Energy(for special abilities), and more. Currency is the name of the game in this Neural-Tech slautghter fest. Need money? Get yourself a hacker and start back from Level 1 all the way up the ladder, unlocking hack-boxes for better loot and increased money. Take alternate paths for hundreds of secrets levels, challanges and puzzles to solve (if you choose and if you dare).\n\nPrefer stealthy gameplay? Use the nanofiber loadout and be undetectable while sniping with a penetrating railrun from the corners and shadows. The AI or Overseer will detect your preference for stealth gameplay and not flood the level with mobs but place them rather strategically, perhaps even throw down some mines to challange you.\n\n\n[h1]Level Design:[/h1]\n:::::The levels are well thought out, balanced, and offer unique challanges each time you play through with random rooms, loot, and the occasional obsticals. \"Hmm, do I shoot that explosive canister and blow up all the enemies in the room? Or be more cautious, pick them off, and take in the loot.\" It's up to you with the beautiful level designs; part pre-made and parts random. The levels increase in difficulty and design as you climb the ladder through each chapter (adding more obsticals, more enemies, or less enemies but stronger ones). All in all, the AI for generating these levels is top-notch.\n\n\n[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]\n::::Overall I can't recommend this game enough. Besides the listed genre(s) of 'Indie' 'Cyberpunk' 'Twin Stick Shooter' and 'Action', this game also has fairly substantial RPG elements as well. The RPG is not hardcore and thus I understand not listing it as an RPG; afterall, it is a top-down slaughter fest. However with the way the upgrades, unlocks, and replayability go - I would also list this game as RPG-lite. 10/10.\n\nPurchase this game, support these devs and spread the word about NEON CHROME! \n\nYou will enjoy this, soldier.", "timestamp_created": 1461968554, "timestamp_updated": 1461969417, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.608061", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22711346": {"recommendationid": "22711346", "author": {"steamid": "76561198209781939", "num_games_owned": 102, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 88, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462014534}, "language": "turkish", "review": "her \u00f6l\u00fc\u015f\u00fcn\u00fczde b\u00fct\u00fcn haritalar s\u0131f\u0131rland\u0131\u011f\u0131 i\u00e7in \u00e7ok g\u00fczel oluyor haritay\u0131 ezberleyip ratata yapma \u015fans\u0131n\u0131z yok oyunu be\u011fendim al\u0131nabilcek bi oyun", "timestamp_created": 1461963756, "timestamp_updated": 1461963756, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22711284": {"recommendationid": "22711284", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971208493", "num_games_owned": 184, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 369, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484010138}, "language": "english", "review": "In Neon Chrome, you play a mysterious hacker attempting to overthrow the tyrannical Overseer of the Neon Chrome corporation through the use of cryogenically frozen combatants, lovingly named \"Assets\".\n\nEach game begins the same way: assume control of one of three randomly generated Assets, each with their own weapons, abilities, and character classes, and fight as far as you can into the heart of the procedurally generated Neon Chrome facility.\n\nNeon Chrome's roguelike formula is not exactly new, but it's a very polished experience.

You start Neon Chrome with a cut scene setting up the plot and your base objective. Overthrow the evil overlord with completely reasonable actions like shooting everything and everyone in sight and breaking through any wall that stands in your way.\n\nNeon Chrome is a lot more complex than it looks. At first it looks like a basic top down shooter with fun enemies to shoot and completely destructible environment but its exactly that along with a fun leveling system, merciless death system, a class system, and situations that\u2019ll smother you with enemies.\nThe class system in Neon Chrome gives you the ability to play how you want to play, giving you options to play like an assassin sneaking in the shadows, a brute destroying everything in your path, a techie with the help of a robot partner, and many other classes you can think of. Each class giving you a new experience in gameplay and mechanics and even being able to switch it up as time goes with the quick upgrading system you can find around the map to either help boost your defense or build your destructiveness.\n\nAs well as the upgrading system within every level there is also a main leveling system to boost your max damage, max health, power meter, luck, and other properties; the only catch is you have to die first to level your character. Might even being the most complex top-down shooter I\u2019ve played, Neon Chrome is also merciless and hard. Not only does it smother you with enemies at your lowest points but once you die you have to start everything over (Except your main leveling system) along with all your solider you\u2019ve upgraded. The only way to get a check point is beating a boss and moving to the next floor even though I\u2019ve never been able to even beat the first boss\u2026\n\nThe destructible environments are top notch with just about everything beings destroy-able. A room that has multiple walls and crates can be shot down to a room full of ruble and bodies with the help of some well places explosives, lots and lots of well places explosives. Even with the added bonus of destructible environments, the levels themselves change every time you die! No level is the same the second time around and each one is as challenging, if not more challenging, than the last! Not only is it fun to play, Neon Chrome also comes with an amazing soundtrack that brings the whole game together. Very energetic and gets you pumped seconds before getting slaughter! It\u2019s hard to not notice the music while playing, nothing annoying and frantic.\n\nOverall, Neon Chrome is an amazing game with a shine to it that screams endless fun. I absolutely loved the game and I\u2019m not even a fan of top-down games (Excluding Hotline Miami). Neon Chrome came out of nowhere but I will definitely be playing more of it and it\u2019ll eventually have mod support, level editor, and more! But meanwhile I wait for that I\u2019ll probably be trying to at least beat the first boss.. I give Neon Chrome 9.0/10! You can get Neon Chrome on Steam for $14.99 but it\u2019s 10% off till May 5th And you can also buy the soundtrack for $4.99! Keep up the good work 10TONS LTD!!

I put over 30 hours into it during the beta test and I still can't get enough. In my opinion, 10tons (the guys who created the amazing crimsonland) have made a masterpiece of a true \"game\" in the purest sense.\n\nNeon Chrome combines the great gunplay from crimsonland with a good dosis of rogue like randomness and a gameplay that starts on the surface but becomes very deep the further you get into it.\n\nI have beaten the game once and I am on my second run through, which is very challenging and as much fun as the first time.\n\nThis is due to some key elements, that make the game as great as it is:\n\t\n\tAtmosphere: The cyberpunk setting of the game is fitting and provides a good atmospheric basement for the experience. Any time you wasted another cyborg clone you feel like the bad guy in \"The prestige\" having just killed another version of yourself from the vast amount of alter egos in cybernetic sleep tanks. The theme is very well executed and the game has a vibe of bladerunner and hard reset, which I find extremely appealing. The fact that you have to fight your way to the highest floor of a futuristic megatower adds a feeling of constant challenge and evokes that \"just one more run\" urge in a big way.\n\t\n\tGunplay: Like crimsonland, the guns are a lot of fun to shoot. Different firearms perform differently and vary in impact and damage. Certain guns require a specific playstyle. It is great fun to sneak around a level as an assassin, becoming invisible in the shadows and sniping away enemies with the railgun. It is also fun to storm through the floors of the tower, making a bloody mess of enemies with a laserburstrifle and melee strikes with your cybernetic arm as the cyberpsycho. There are several character classes to choose from, everyone with a different random loadout, that you might also finetune if you have the cash to do so. This makes for an almost endless variety in playable characters, as you find more enhancements and weapons through the level, your litte alter ego gets more and more powerful and more and more specialized in dealing with the many enemies the overseer throws in your path. If you die, it's over. Permadeath is a bummer, but also the reason for you to cheerish every run on its own as a achievement.\n\t\n\tLeveldesign: The levels are randomly generated. They differ in appearance and style from floor to floor. 10tons did a great job of assuring a huge amount of variation in the levels and giving every floor of the tower its own theme. While you will certainly recognize some room patterns every now and then, the levelsign in itself works great and I never had the feeling of repetition during my 30 hours of beta play. Another exciting feature is the fact, that the levels are almost completely destructible. Guns can shoot through many walls and often provide you with a tactical advantage, be it hitting someone in the back by destryoing the wall he is hidden behind or simply blast entire levelsections to pieces with a grenade or by hitting an explosive device.\n\t\n\tAI: After I knew what was going on in neon chrome i was expecting the kind of mindless enemy behaviour I knew from similar looking games like alien shooter or Alien Breed. But instead of bad guys running at me in a straight line, I experienced quite a diversitude of KI routines. Some guards might charge at you directly, others will try to get you from another angle. Enemies will run around mines that you have placed on the floor and clump together to overhelm you. Every now and then patrols will appear and searchteams will enter the level to snuff you out. I find the enemies in the game extremely challenging especially in the later levels when heavy armoured guys will join forces with commander cyborgs that are quite hard to overcome and require some planning.\n\t\n\tSometimes I had an almost hotline miami approach on the rooms, on other occasions it feels more like isaac, but it is always challenging and every error will be punished.\n\t\n\tUpgrades: The game features an upgrade system similar to hard reset, where you occasionally find upgrade stations that allow you to choose from a selection of body implants to be inserted in your cyborg body. Like the perks in crimsonland, these upgrades and finding the right combination of them, is key to beating the game. In combination with the different loadouts and the chosen characterclass, you will have a great deal of customization. As you progress towards the top of the tower you will unlock more and more upgrades for you to choose from. The feeling of constant progression is one of the many joys of the game...\n\t\nI could go on and on about how much I enjoy neon chrome, but I will end this little overview with the remark, that this game feels like a REAL \"game\". I is a little oldschool, but highly polished and with so much depth and replay value, that I almost thought I would never see this kind of game again. Neon chrome reminds me of a time, when a game was simply a game: easy to understand, hard to master and with enough to offer to start it again and again until it had revealed all of its secrets. I still play it every other day and have more fun than with any of the \"big budget triple something\" titels in recent years.\n\nI applaud 10tons for bringing out a title like this and hope, that it will pay off for them.\n\nI cannot recommend this game enough....\n\n\nPS: and the soundtrack is also great:)", "timestamp_created": 1461952692, "timestamp_updated": 1461955971, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505491", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22705067": {"recommendationid": "22705067", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034458789", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 650, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462199455}, "language": "german", "review": "Bescheuert!\nNach 3 Stunden spielen ist nach einem Neustart mein komletter spielstand gel\u00f6scht!\nReinfall!...und daf\u00fcr habe ich geld ausgegeben!", "timestamp_created": 1461939385, "timestamp_updated": 1461939385, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.299056", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22703114": {"recommendationid": "22703114", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983496069", "num_games_owned": 297, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 373, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475668729}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is superb. I have to admit I wasn't sure I would like it because I'm not usually into twin-stick shooters and this kind of high-speed action, but the game is so responsive to the player, the gameplay evolves in so many interesting ways, and the music and graphical style so engaging I got hooked very quickly.\n\nThe central conceit is that you control a series of agents that are heading out into some corporate mega-tower to fight their way to the top past armies of robots, guards, turrets and traps. As with all games of this style you need to have quick reactions and death isn't something you can save-scum to get past. So far, so normal. But what Neon Chrome does that's particularly fun is randomize the levels, loot and skills while death is annoying, it isn't a total setback. Cash and unlocks you have earned before death can be used by your main character to enhance the next agent sent out into the field. This means that even a bad run can be wortwhile as death sends you back to do more upgrading and purchases and to select a new agent, perhaps with the opportunity to try a new strategy.\n\nThis cycle of play-die-enhance-play more is really quite engaging and even though I'm kinda bad at these kind of games I always felt like I was making progress and achieving something. I highly recommend Neon Chrome and if you'd like to see it in action, check out the videos I put together showing it off below.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsXQw5nF32Q&list=PLCymfyavV-yM9ZbAuu_rjlui3jNU_1KFx", "timestamp_created": 1461930832, "timestamp_updated": 1461930832, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502034", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22702819": {"recommendationid": "22702819", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992509819", "num_games_owned": 1049, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 126, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462068490}, "language": "english", "review": "Imagine Rogue Legacy's random player system and inject it into an 80's retro futuristic top down twin stick shooter.

The gameplay mechanics, weapon variety, and perks make this game very fun to play.  I highly recommend this game to those that enjoy this type of genre and newcomers as well.\n\n\nThe game can be played with KB+M or controller.  As for gameplay there are 28 stages, each stage consists of going from point A to point B, sometimes there will objects that you have to do in order to advance to the next stage.  Throughout the levels you will find money, weapons, perks, and weapon upgrade stations.  \n\nThe environment is semi-destructible, you can shoot or smash walls down to create new entry ways.  I should note that this is limited, but the feature is there and works very well.\n\nAfter you die and you have the option to purchase upgrades that will remain permanent throughout your entire gameplay.  Also the game has save points, if you exit mid-stage, upon starting the game again you start at the beginning of the stage.  If you beat a boss, this will unlock a new starting point so if you die at any stage after the boss, you won't have to start from the very beginning again, you continue right after the boss.\n\nI don't have any major gripes.  I will say that not having the ability to dodge is kind of a bummer, but does not ruin the overall experience.\n\nAs for hours to price ratio, you will definitely get your money's worth and much more.  I've played a variety of roguelites/likes and none of them really gives me that strong \"just one more run...\" feeling like this game does.  This is due to the very awesome gameplay this game offers.  I can die in-game all day long and I wouldn't care because the game is really fun.\n\nI hope this review was helpful to you. .", "timestamp_created": 1461929227, "timestamp_updated": 1461929710,

Chrome[/i] plays very similar but is more polished (the two are very different in other important ways though - ie. this is not a bullet hell [i]per se[/i]). Essentially, in Neon Chrome, you have a primary and secondary weapon, plus a melee attack. The secondary weapon takes ammo, and all the primary weapon needs is reloading management. The melee attack takes much more skill and planning, but is totally worth getting to know. You play a series of clones (very similiar to [i]Starward Rogue[/i]), in an attempt to climb a corporate tower. The voice acting is very good, and the story seems decent. \n\n[i]Like any game of this genre, its all about the meta-game.[/i] The clone you are currently driving will collect money for meta-game upgrades such as health, damage, slots, etc. This will help ensure success for future clones.\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n+Controls and gameplay are butter smooth.

You'll have a huge array of weapons ranging from pistols to miniguns, and laser shotguns to plazma burts rifles. There is no shortage of weapons here, and they are all unique and fit different play styles. Similar to Crimsonland, is the fact that all guns have unlimited ammo. Personally, I love that. This game in punishing enough it's a relief to not have to worry about running out of ammo. The gunplay overral is great.\n\nGraphical quality: The graphics in the game are gorgeous. They really have that neon/cyberpunk feel and it's just beautiful to look at. The animations are butter smooth, and I have never had any framedrops or lag issues, even in heavy combat situations. The game is very well optimized and has a fair amount of graphical options. The graphical quality overral is awesome.\n\nSoundtrack and sound effects: Neon Chrome's phenomenal music is one of the best part about this game, it's breathtaking! The music is epic, very cyberpunky and I really hope the game get's an OST DLC. The sound in this game is quite good too. Every gun sounds different, and all the impact sounds and explosions sounds great too. The audio quality overall is incredible.\n\nGameplay elements: The gameplay in this game is extremely good. The environment is nearly fully destructible which makes for some very tense boss fights. That first boss was insane, you had nowhere to hide because all the cover would end up getting destroyed. I would have to say this game has some of the most adrenaline-pumping boss battles I've ever encountered. The gameplaye-style has some great rouge-like elements that are quite similar The Binding of Isaac. You get to choose from 3 randomized characters at the beginning, and it's fun to be able to play with different characters that have different unique attributes. The levels are quite spectacular, no level is the same, they are all randomly generated (exept that story levels) and flow really nicely. I've died so many tiems yet it never feels like you play the same level again. This gives that game a lot of replayability and a reason to keep playing. The game also has checkpoints so you don't have to start from the beginning each time. There is also permanent upgrades which you can buy with in-game earnt money that give you a small boost. You will also be collecting a lot of perks, which are similar to that of Crimsonland, and they really add to the randomness as well. The game get's really hard but you never feel that it is unfairly punishing. You will always be getting better, becoming more skilled, getting more upgrades, unlocking more weapons and perks, you're always making progress, so death never feels like much of a penalty. The A.I. in this game is reactive and never bugs out, which is great. The game allows you to be stealthy as well. The gameplay overall is satisfying and very fun.\n\nStory and features: The story of the game is that you're trying to stop an evil \"Overseer.\" I didn't really pay much attention to it, but at least the story is there, unlike Crimsonland. As you can tell from the trailers and pictures, the game takes part on a giant megastructure in some sort of futuristic city. The setting is really nice and the music, gameplay and graphics all come together nicely. One nice feature I would like to note is like Crimsonland, blood and corpses are permanent. This gives this game a great aftermath and really makes a difference. The story overall is interesting and intriguing, nothing too special, but definitely great for a top-down shooter.\n\nVerdict: In conclusion, if you enjoy roguelikes, top-down shooters, a fun and challenging co-op experience, or even like cyberpunk in general, definitely try this game out. I have never played a top-down shooter that was as polished, well made and fun to play as this. The game is so addicting, and luckily there's abosultey no microtransactions which is a plus. I can not think of anything to fault this game for, it's just pure goodness. \nTL;DR: Overall, this is probably the very best top-down twin-stick shooter game I have played.

This did not influence my review in any way.\n\n[h1]==========================================================\n---------------------------------------OVERVIEW-------------------------------------\n==========================================================[/h1]\nNeon Chrome is a frantic cyberpunk twin-stick shooter from the developers who made Crimsonland. \n\nIn Neon Chrome, you play an unknown hacker who, through the use of a neural interface immersion chair, is able to hack into countless cryogenically frozen cybernetic bodies and control them in your battle against the Overseer, the megalomaniacal ruler of a futuristic megacity arcology called Neon Chrome.\n\nEach of your available bodies is one of a small number of roles -- assassin, hacker, psycho, etc. -- each with its own special ability. For example, the hacker bodies have drone followers and can hack into strongboxes and other in-game objects, whereas the assassin bodies have cyberwear that lets them hide in the shadows.\n\nAfter picking a body (an 'asset') and waking it up, control switches directly to that body, and you enter the lift on your way up the 30 levels to the top of the arcology, where you will do deadly battle with the Overseer.\n\n[h1]==========================================================\n----------------------------------------QUALITY-------------------------------------\n==========================================================[/h1]\nGraphics - When I first loaded up Neon Chrome I thought, \"Oh yes... .\" The title screen is fantastic!\n\nThen when I entered the game, at first I thought the graphics looked a bit blurry, but I think I just didn't like the film-grain effect. After turning that off in the settings menu, everything looked much sharper, and more to my liking. Either way, though, the graphics are fantastic. \n\nEverything is just spot on. From the subtle purple neon glow of the pause menu boundaries, to the animated screens that litter the various early levels of the game, to the great explosions and small, but detailed, enemies. It all looks good, moves well, and really sucks you into the story.\n\nOther than the aforementioned film grain, there are also settings for bloom, anti-aliasing, and more, as well as the standard resolution settings. I played on my old gaming laptop (Nvidia 485m graphics card) in full HD with everything except for film grain turned on, and it didn't skip a beat.\n\nI just wish I could zoom in closer to the action on occasion, and zoom out for an overhead or map view.\n\n\nSound - As with the graphics, the title screen music grabbed me from the start, and didn't let go even once while I was playing. Throughout everything there's an electronic vibe, but it ranges between a hard and heavy sort of industrial feel with thumping beats, almost to elevator musak in some places. It's very well done, enhancing the atmosphere created by the story and graphics.\n\nSound effects are good, too, with appropriate bleeps and bloops, great gun and explosion sounds, and occasional grunts and groans when your current asset or one of its many human enemies is hurt.\n\nThe overseer's voice in the introductory section seemed overdone to me, for about the first 10 seconds, but it grew on me quickly. Occasional voices while you're playing the game (e.g. when you get a new implant) are very well done, and once again add to the great atmosphere.\n\n\nGameplay - As with the graphics and sound, I was blown away by the introduction. I started the game and thought, \"WTF is going on!?\", but within a few seconds it all started to come together and, then I died. Then the overseer's voice threatened to find me -- the real me -- and this was displayed on the screen:\n\n[i]DISCONNECTED - NEURAL LINK LOST\n\n...\n\nSeconds Alive: 184 (best ever!)[/i]\n\nI was grinning from ear to ear!\n\nThe basic game plays like any other twin-stick shooter: WASD (or left controller stick) moves you around, while mouse (or right controller stick) aims your weapon. Neon Chrome gives you two weapons to use at any one time, an infinite-ammo primary weapon, and a secondary weapon that you need to refill with energy that you collect, as well as a simple melee attack, for when enemies get too close.\n\nRogue-like elements have been perfectly blended with the basic gameplay, leading to procedurally generated levels that are different with each asset you control, random loot of varying rarity and power levels, and random enemies (within reason) on normal levels. There are also a number of 'special levels' randomly spread around with each play through.\n\nAnd then there are all of the cool enhancements available to you. After each run and before your Unknown Hacker chooses another asset to send to its death, you can spend credits collected from previous runs on stat increases (permanent), or temporary purchases of abilities, cyberwear, and weapons, which will be given to your next asset. As the Unknown Hacker's hideout, the 'home room' really enhances the atmosphere, too.\n\nWhile playing an asset, he or she can gain various upgrades and weapons, too, as well as temporary effects like penetrating shots or a vampiric field around you that sucks the life out of anything that walks into it and transfers health to you.\n\nThe game has a local co-op multiplayer mode as well, which I can only imagine must be amazingly cool, but I haven't had a chance to try it. There's no online multiplayer, unfortunately.\n\n[h1]==========================================================\n-------------------------------------PROS & CONS-----------------------------------\n==========================================================[/h1]\nPros:\n+ Fantastic graphics throughout. I still catch my breath when I see that title screen\n+ Excellent sound\n+ Great atmosphere\n+ Lots of explosions; most objects can be destroyed\n+ Very replayable\n+ Full controller support\n+ Achievements and trading cards as well\n+ I haven't found a spelling or grammatical error yet\n\nCons:\n- No zoom in for close up of the action or zoom out for overview, or map of the current level\n\n[h1]==========================================================\n--------------------------------------CONCLUSION-----------------------------------\n==========================================================[/h1]\nNeon Chrome is one of the most polished indie games I've ever played. It drips cyberpunk atmosphere and continues to impress me over and over again.

There are a lot of influences from their previous title here, but they also were not afraid to branch out a bit, and make something new, without having a cookie cutter game too similar to their last.\n\n\nThe game's controls are pretty standard for that of a twin stick shooter. Whilst looking at your character from a top down view, one hand (or stick) controls movement, and the other controls aiming and shooting. Unlike a few twin stick shooters I have played, there is also a melee button, and more unlike other twin stick games, the melee is actually quite useful and powerful. The game can be played with a Mouse and Keyboard setup, or with a controller (although I haven't tried it with a controller yet), and with other controllers, can be played by up to four people in a Local Co-op setting.\n\nIn the game, you are playing a hacker, who is using \"assets\", basically blank slate people/bots to assault the Neon Chrome facility. The facility is run by the Overseer, who is evil for some such reason and has a bit of dialouge at the beginning, and a few levels here and there. I'm sure once you progress more, his character gets flushed out a bit more, but I've only got a bit over two hours in it, and haven't progressed that far yet. These assets are what you play as, and use to assault the facility; every time you die you are taken back to a small room where you (the hacker), have a few terminals available to you where you can upgrade your character(s), look at what you've unlocked (weapons, cybernetics,etc) and choose your next assest to play with. There are a few different classes of assets, but three will be randomly available to you each time you spawn. Classes include a Techie, who has a rechargable shield and more energy than the others, but less overall health, an Assassain who in the shadows is harder for enemies to spot and detect and several more. Each class will also have a different weapon and ability each time, so sometimes it's best to pick a class for a weapon you like, rather than a specific skill set. As you progress though the game, you will be collecting money from dead enemies, or from looting various items you come across. This money can be spent at some of the other terminals to upgrade your assets after your death, but before you pick a new asset to use. The upgrades are Health, Damage, Luck (increases cash you pick up and rarity of loot), Energy (used for your abilities; shockwave, missles,etc) and Slots (which determines how many cybernetic upgrades you can carry [explained later]). \n\nOnce you've picked an asset, you will then be able to pick which floor you start on, 1 through 6, but you can only start at floors 2 and higher once you have reached them at least once. Between each set of floors are different levels, all randomly generated, between floors 1 and 2 are three levels, 2 and 3 are five, and more are added between higher level floors for a total of 31 levels. There are bosses that seperate each floor as well, and can be quite difficult. You will spend some time dying and \"buying\" your way to better stats to take them on easier. You will spawn in an elevator in each level, and be looking for a green one to proceed to the next. Through each level, there will be various enemies and traps (laser fields, mines and the like), as well as boxes to loot for money, and crates with weapons and/or cybernetic upgrades and each time will be different, as the levels are randomly generated. The cybernetic upgrades are essentially perks, and are found in small capsules you walk in that are randomly placed in the levels. Once you activate it, you have a choice from three random ones that you get to keep for the duration of this assest's life. The perks include things like faster rate of fire and more damage, more melee damage, move faster and many many more. There are 50 perks altogether, but most of them must be found in other crates while you progress, and some perks can only be found on certain floors (so you can't get amazing end tier perks just by playing the first levels over and over). After buying the upgraded slots for your asset you can have a maximum of 10, so you must pick wisely. There are also crates with different weapons to be found, and some crates that upgrade the loot level of weapons you will find (including the weapon you currently have), giving them more damage. On some levels, there are alternate purple elevators (which you will see an alternate path between levels 5-6 for example, on the loading screen) which will take you to a sort of bonus level, each has it's own sort of theme for a puzzle, and will you often be rewarded with a box containing a new perk to them go into your random pool for when you upgrade yourself.\n\nAs far as variety goes, there seems to be quite a bit. There are 50 cybernetic upgrades, 16 abilities and 26 weapons that you can unlock and there are different sets to be aquired on different floors. There are lots of different enemies and traps/defense systems you will encounter, and of the two bosses I've faced so far, each was very different and had a unique method to sucessfully killing.\n\nThe graphics won't blow you away, but the atmosphere and colours will. The game is called Neon Chrome, and for good reason, there are plenty of bright and flashing colours making the levels very vibrant and appealing. The game has pretty low system requirements so I can't really see anyone having any issues running this on max, and in my time I haven't had any frame issues or stutter at all. The game simply runs smooth, and lets you sit down and shoot stuff without worrying about how well it will run. The sound effects are also good, and the music is what you'd expect looking at a game like this - a very 80's style electronic and futuristic music.\n\n\n[b] Pros [/b]\n[list]\n[*] Extremely fun and easy to pick up\n[*] Very bright and colourful level designs\n[*] Rouge-like elements and lots to unlock will keep you coming back\n[*] Great variety in weapons and abilities/perks as well as enemies\n[*] Four player local co-op\n[*] Lots of destructible envrionments and objects\n[/list]\n\n[b]Cons [/b]\n[*] Only one game mode (Crimsonland had various types of surivial modes in addition to the main quest)\n[*] Local Co-op, would have loved if this had some online co-op, even if it was only for two people\n[*] Perhaps a bit pricey for most considering the genre (16.99 CDN when full price)\n[/list]\n\nAll in all, so far I love it. I put a ton of hours in their previous game both on steam, and long before that and I can see this gane will be the same way.

This is an excellent game. It's essential. It's fun. It's addictive and rewarding.\n\nYou have classes with genuine differences. All are fun. The weapons and violence are exceptional. Heads come off, chunks fly. Bullets whizz and lasers feel hot and clinical. It has recoil mechanics and stealth, alert and line of sight mechanics and varying levels of weapon penetration. \n\nDestructible environment. If you see a heavy guard with a riot shield in the next room, they are invulnerable to regular weapon-fire from the front, you blow a hole in the wall behind him and blast him to chunks from the back with a critical sneak attack. You can melee. You can upgrade the melee skill, you can smash through walls like robocop and unleash hell. \n\nThere are excellent bosses with phases. I've put in 22 hours and I have seen 3 of the total 6(?). [spoiler]A spider-tank boss]that walks you down, tearing up the scenery with it's guns blazing. A Centipede/trainbot that patrols spawning increasingly dangerous mobs and mines. A very open helicopter battle complete with radio chatter, guns and lock on super weapons.[/spoiler]\n\nIt's procedural and has permadeath. You loot cash and energy from your foes. When you die you are disconnected from your puppet of flesh. You get out of the immersion chair and spend the cash on skills and weapons. When you are ready to go again, you go back to the chair, and awake another \"body\" from the rows and rows of stasis pods. So there is a lovely and macabre sense of cost, drive and a seemingly morally ambiguous protagonist. I'm responsible for about 79 now empty pods. I keep throwing bodies at The Overseer of the Neon Chrome building and it's security which he controls. Learning the really solid gameplay mechanics and getting stronger though the incremental upgrades in Damage, Health, Energy, Luck, Augment Slots etc etc.\n\nI could talk all day just about the gameplay mechanics and how fun and gripping it is, but it looks great, has brilliant sound design and good music as well. A very polished and well tuned action rogueLITE that rewards skill and thought while staying absolutely action packed and fluid. There's no fat on this game. You start it, you get in the chair, you start with the death-dealing. There's no painful intro/splash screens, no long periods of downtime between deaths.\n\nI love this game.

We should do something about that. [/h1]\n\nNeon Chrome is a cyberpunk, top-down shooter from the developer of Crimsonland, 10tons. In Neon Chrome you play as assets, used by a strange character (who you also play as, sort of) in order to try and take down the mysterious Overseer. The Overseer has full control over Neon Chrome\u2019s human and robotic guards and he\u2019s more than happy to use brutal force to stop anyone in his way. That includes you by the way. As you battle through thirty-one levels, taking place over six levels of the building, you\u2019ll face increasingly difficult enemies and even a few mini-bosses and bosses. It won\u2019t be easy but you\u2019re not exactly in short supply of assets, you\u2019ll get there eventually.\n\nFull Disclosure: A review copy was provided by the developer.\n\nBefore every run you can move around a level of Neon Chrome which is halfway between an apartment and a human storage complex. I\u2019m not sure how to label the character but they have a strange chair/headset device that they use to control the assets, the assets are who you mainly play as. In this stage of the game you can also buy upgrades (such as improved health or damage) as well as purchase weapons, abilities and cybernetic enhancements that your next asset will use when you use them. In this area you can also track your stats, such as how many assets you\u2019ve used, as well as see what achievements you\u2019ve unlocked and what rewards they have earned you.\n\nThe assets themselves vary a fair bit, the main variation coming from what class they are. There are a few different classes in the game, ranging from Assassin (my personal favourite) to Cyber Psycho, each with their own class-specific ability. The Assassin\u2019s ability, for example, is that they become completely invisible when they are standing or moving around in shadows while the Cyber Psycho has +20% Hit Points and +2 Enhancement slots. Each class also has its own stats, i.e. health, energy (used for the asset\u2019s other ability), speed, damage and critical hit chance. The classes are very different to each other and require slightly to drastically different strategies to be successful with them, adding a nice level of depth to the game.\n\nThe assets also have a weapon, a non-class-specific ability and a name (well duh). The weapon can be any of the weapons you have unlocked (more can be unlocked by finding special box-type things in the levels, which also applies to enhancements and the second kind of abilities.) You can also unlock the same weapon but with a different projectile, for example you can have a regular shotgun as well as an Ion Shotgun or a Plasma Shotgun. The second type of ability is effectively a secondary attack, this could be lock-on missiles or blast grenades, there are quite a few to unlock. These abilities require energy which is collected from loot boxes. Each ability can be used a certain number of times before you run out and need more energy, for example you can use your grenades three times. Enhancements can be equipped from a CyberHance Express station (found on most levels). You have a certain amount of slots for these enhancements (upgradeable) so if you run out of slots you\u2019ll have to choose one to replace with the new enhancement. There\u2019s a wide variety of enhancements available from the basic stuff that increases health or speed to enhancements that cause your bullets to split and cause 30% more damage.\n\nAs I said earlier, Neon Chrome consists of thirty-one levels across six floors. When you reach a new floor (the level after a boss fight) you can then start from that new floor and skip the levels leading up to that. It\u2019s a great way to help you progress through the game though it does mean you miss out on all the loot from the previous floors when starting from that floor which is a problem seeing as there\u2019s a spike in difficulty from one floor to the next. There is of course a difference in difficulty between the levels too but it\u2019s more noticeable when you reach a new floor. For the most part, you just have to reach the green (or purple for a special level) elevator at the end of the level to go to the next one but some levels will have objectives for you to complete first, e.g. destroy five specific targets. The levels are also randomly generated (apart from the boss fight levels) so you\u2019ll never see the same run twice.\n\nAn increase in difficulty doesn\u2019t just mean more enemies though, it means harder enemies and new kinds of enemies. From what I\u2019ve played, enemies don\u2019t get phased out, they just get phased in meaning you\u2019ll be introduced to new enemy types every few levels. You\u2019ll also face off against \u2018special\u2019 enemies. These consist of normal enemies with some kind of buff/special ability, for example an enemy marked as SWIFT as a much higher movement speed than a regular enemy. Some levels have a mini-boss, again this is a variation of a regular enemy with a special ability and in this case better stats too and at the end of every floor you come across a full boss. The boss fights are incredibly challenging, it took me several attempts to get through the first one for example. Thankfully (if you\u2019ve collected a lot of loot) you\u2019ll be able to buy new upgrades which will help you next time you take on the boss. Furthermore, once you beat the Overseer you reach a new OS level which significantly increases the difficulty across all levels. As far as I\u2019m aware there\u2019s no limit on OS levels but it does take a lot longer to get through them anyway.\n\nSo, let\u2019s talk about loot. There\u2019s quite a lot of it. Most of what you\u2019ll find are small boxes which, when opened, will net you a couple of hundred bucks and a little bit of energy, you generally find one or two in each room when playing. Then you\u2019ve got slightly bigger boxes in which you\u2019ll find more money and energy as well as (sometimes) health kits and even weapons. Then you\u2019ve got healing stations, unlock boxes (the things I mentioned earlier which contain new abilities, weapons or enhancements), weapon crates and weapon upgrade machines (levels up your gun which improves its stats). Also, enemies drop loot in the form of money and energy, they drop about the same as a small box but special enemies drop more. While energy, weapons etc. only matter for the asset you collect them with, your money and unlocks are persistent.\n\nJust a couple more things to mention. The sound track is absolutely fantastic, it really fits the game well but there didn\u2019t seem to be many tracks so it would\u2019ve been nice to see a few more. The controls are also really good, they felt very responsive and the default configuration works well (though it can be changed). While I\u2019m talking about controls, it\u2019s worth knowing that your asset\u2019s speed has an impact on how quickly they turn, it\u2019s not a case of the controls being unresponsive, this also applies to enemies which can be used to your advantage.\n\n[h1]Verdict [/h1]\n\nNeon Chrome is a thoroughly enjoyable top-down shooter with a lot of gameplay variation, unlockables and quite a bit of replay value. All of this wrapped up in an awesome cyberpunk setting. If you\u2019re a fan of top-down shooters, I\u2019d definitely recommend checking this one out.\n\n[i][url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/lonerangerreviews#curation]Lone Ranger Reviews.[/url][/i]\n\nEl K.", "timestamp_created": 1461859194, "timestamp_updated": 1461860836, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 68, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.710344", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22689650": {"recommendationid": "22689650", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001656242", "num_games_owned": 767, "num_reviews": 86, "playtime_forever": 2035, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1461857906}, "language": "english", "review": "So Neon Chrome is releasing today. \n\nIf you're looking for gameplay to factor into your purchasing decision: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU1HWde4IZI\n\nI've logged over 22 hours in the game (and finished it once).

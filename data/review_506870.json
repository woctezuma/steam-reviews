Tilesets, level layouts, enemies, puzzles and pickups vary wildy each playthrough, while still forming a cohesive experience as you play. Each playthrough truly feels like an adventure where you learn to expect the unexpected!\n\n[b]Combat is simple, smooth and satisfying[/b] Landing a blow feels like an accomplishment, and the game will regularly present unexpected combat situations where you have to think fast to get out of a jam, or carefully plan a strategy to get past a tough area.\n\n[b]Large variety of weapons and resources each with their own strategy and purpose[/b] Certain weapons/abilities are good in certain situations but not so good in others. You must learn to improvise and adapt based on your available resources to make the best out of each situation, and rely on your combat skills to survive.\n\nCONS:\n[b]Graphics are.... well kinda meh[/b] Everything has a sort of flat paper-like look to it. And the characters look pretty weird, I'm not a fan of the eyeball! The graphics are still appealing to me in a simple, striaght-forward kind of way, but I know there are some gamers who have high expectations and will be turned off by Unexplored's simplistic graphics. Don't let the appearance fool you, this game has a great deal of depth and content!\n\n[b]Stability[/b] The generator is pretty elaborate and can cause crashes, which can get annoying at times. The developers are continuously working to improve stability and I started backing up my save folder to remedy this issue.\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS:\nIf you like Roguelites you need to pick this game up and give it a try.

Fantastic.\n\nI'll admit that I wasn't expecting to get so much this game. But it was full of quality gaming material with fabulous replayability. There are still many things I haven't managed to do and find, after 50 hours!\n\nBut finally, with Chethero the Thirty-Ninth, I brought the fabled Amulet of Yendor to the surface[strike] on casual mode[/strike]!\n\nFor me, the overall level of complexity is just right. You don't need to learn a new language of terms to know what your enchanted gear actually does, and you won't have to look up a wiki site to figure out a good way to use your items. And yet, the game puts you in complex enough situations that you feel elated when you use gear efficiently and devastated when they go to waste. And in the end, your careful performance is what is going to determine how close you get to that famous, elusive amulet. Unexplored does a great job of creating that feeling of wanting to know what's behind that door, of the thrill of defeating a rare boss, and of that excitement of walking away with loot you've never seen before. And when you die, you may not mind losing it all, because you'll know the generator will cook up levels that were just as engaging as the last, and it's probably going to have a whole different set of challenges and aspects of progression. Who knows, maybe the next run will have that boss you need to kill for an achievement? Or maybe there'll be another chance at that secret room you locked yourself out of last time...\n\nI feel that repetitiveness, which seems to be a dread among rogue-likes, is a very long time away. It may never come.\n\nI still haven't earned all the classes, and there's only eight. Sure, it might be reflective of my proficiency, whatever. But they're meaningful classes, and your choice can hugely affect the way your encounters play out. How could it not, if you choose to enter the dungeon wielding a valuable pistol, such a difficult item to acquire inside? But what will you do when you run out of gunpowder and bullets; how will you ever find that? This game is full of considerations like this, and it's entertaining and thought-provoking.\n\nPlaying things out on a 2-D map in real time makes the experience active and immersive, but it is implemented in a way that still rewards good play and punishes recklessness like some great turn-based games do. One does not simply walk into the Dungeon of Doom, not even in casual mode. The game won't require extreme precision, but fighting perfectly can certainly be challenging. If in doubt, you can always pause and strategize. I think the best way to know what exactly the combat is like is to simply watch a video.\n\nOne downside is that I wish the game had richer visuals and better effects. I mean, the iron ore is nothing but a white pentagon. But the simplistic, somewhat cute design direction has its own appeal, and it's easy to look at. The soundtrack is good for creating the atmosphere and transitions well in-game, but it's probably not going to win any Grammy's. But really, I almost feel bad criticizing the presentation aspects when I know that in a game like this, it's all about the gameplay anyway. And the gameplay is remarkably good, so any shortcomings in the presentation aspects should be easily overlooked in light of it.\n\n\nThe combination of tactical execution and smart decision-making, leading to satisfying success. I think it's one of the great appeals of all rogue-likes, and this game nails it.

It might not, you might be just trying to amass some arrows to unlock a class or maximise your gold to make next start easier.\nEach time you play, your characters can't indentify scrolls or potions, so that adds to the fun ( sometimes its obvious when you dig some liquid from a well and it APPEARS to be creating gas = so thats obviously a gas potion.)\n\nIt is uniquely challenging and to be honest the random nature CAN be punishing from the get go.\nOnce you learn the subtle ins and outs ( right click stuff, its how you learn )\nWhen you realise killing stuff ISN'T everything, you end up playing a bit differently.\nWeapons are all varied and interesting, and you learn quite a bit about how the enemies function ( they are relentless sometimes )\nI really enjoy how darkness, fire and the little sprites function.

It means \"unforgiving dungeon crawler with maybe optional perma-death, and what the hell, maybe it's actually about space ships\" and that's fine, because definitions change, and I am not prescriptive with my linguistics (it is literally futile, trust me brah).\n\nBut there was a time when Roguelike had an exquisitely narrow meaning. It meant, and you might want to sit down... Similiar to Rogue*.  \n\nOkay, relax, I know that horse has been beaten to the point that it is effectively liquid, I mean I never thought you could drink a horse, but yes, it's pulpy but doable. But that's disgusting, and you should be ashamed. Horses are majestic. Good for your testosterone though.\n\nBut I digress. \n\nUnexplored is an actual Roguelike, a love letter to Roguelikes, and should be considered part of the glorious tradition of Angband, ADOM, Nethack, Brogue and, why not, Dwarf Fortress. \n\nThere are many familiar elements, like dangerous equipment that has to be identified because it might bear terrible curses. The graphics are simple but interesting... There is a fair bit of Zelda mixed in to make it more skill-based. It has a tremendous amount of content and the devs continue to expand it and sand down the few rough edges that remain.\n\nUnexplored is deep and unforgiving, and often has a tense spooky quality, because it implements permadeath in a way that conveys a sense of danger without being too punishing or grindy. And although it still has some bugs here and there (one of the devs fixed my save file and sent it back to me when I happened upon a problem), it is great, and I highly recommend it.\n\n* Rogue was a text-based dungeon crawler where you died a lot.

First and foremost this sets a new gold standard for procedural generation in games. Not roguelikes; absolutely anything, at all. the developer's concept of cyclical level generation does what no game before has -- creating a rich, varied, and complex play experience each and every game, with levels, puzzles and traps that feel hand-crafted. \n\nThe game's ability to generate a holistic dungeon environment, implement backtracking and secrets in inteesting ways and create a consistend dungeon ecology from level to level creates a feeling of a hand-crafted dungeon delve on every playthrough (or nearly so). After more than 100 hours i'm still finding new surprises, getting caught off guard by unexpected situations and even seeing new bosses and items that i haven't encountered before.\n\nMore than this, JD has created a dungeon environment with enough variation and cleverly-programmed interactions between elements and items that a very rare thing emerges; you begin to realize that just about anything that seems like it should work, does. As simple as it sounds, this is a profound concept, and all the more impressive that the game manages it with a seemingly simple, top-down hack and slash style of play. Simple controls, a light but satisfyingly chunky stat system and a low fantasy, low-magic sort of setting means finding a single bundle of arrows, a potion of poison gas, a staff of disarming, can all be momentous experiences, defining a playthrough or giving you the key you need to escape doom at a critical moment -- aided, again, by the level generator's cleverness.\n\nIf you like roguelikes, zelda-style action adventures where your tools are your weapons, classical dungeon delves, or just want to see what should rightly be the new acceptable standard for random level generation -- grab Unexplored, give it a few runs, and watch it surprise you again and again.", "timestamp_created": 1507173723, "timestamp_updated": 1507173723, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 27, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.752366", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35475850": {"recommendationid": "35475850", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054127163", "num_games_owned": 49, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 137, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507248313}, "language": "english", "review": "Crashes constanly, Dungeons are weird (and often bugged), visuals/art style is terrible. \nYou often find yourself locked in a room with higher level monsters you can't escape, loosing all your progress.", "timestamp_created": 1507135575, "timestamp_updated": 1507135575, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.304194", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35332932": {"recommendationid": "35332932", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036462079", "num_games_owned": 378, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 534, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507566192}, "language": "french", "review": "comme beaucoup le remarquent, ce jeu est un descendant spirituel de l'excellent #Brogue. et je dois dir que tout est dit.\nS'il y a un truc \u00e0 ajouter, bah regarde le gameplay de jouer sur YT fr (petite pub pour : Gobbopathe Unexplored le t)s play ) et apr\u00e8s il reste \u00e0 clicker sur \"Ajouter au panier Steam\".\n~* Acheter ce jeu!", "timestamp_created": 1506769815, "timestamp_updated": 1506769815, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35260504": {"recommendationid": "35260504", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047418374", "num_games_owned": 396, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 5735, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512334007}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a really fun take on the Roguelike genre.

The game is easy to learn (on low difficulty) and hard to master. I already had fun with this title after the first 5 minutes. You just dive into it. No steep learning curve here.

in a way it is also its worthy successor by choosing to be realtime instead of being turn based. It has its own unique flavor and personality so that it does not feel like a rip-off at all -- on the contrary, I'd say Unexplored is how a contemporary roguelike game should be like.\n\nThe game is hard, and has permadeath, so do not expect to easily beat this game, especially not on the first couple of tries. But it is a good thing, because this way your achievements will actually mean something for you. You'll feel like you have truly achieved and conquered something even if you could not complete the quest at that time (and you can re-try as many times as you want). Since the environment is procedurally generated and Unexplored has a lot of content, replayability is essentially infinite, which is not bad for a game that can be purchased for a limited amount of money. :)\n\nRegarding technology, I really like the visuals which is presented in a 3D top-down view. The environment and the characters are made of sharp, vector-like shapes, and cleverly and dynamically applied shadows and lights make everything feel alive and dangerous. The soundtrack is also nice as well as the sound effects. The menu system (including the in-game inventory) is simple but effective and works well.\n\nI recommend this game for anyone who likes to explore and wants to experience a modern roguelike, even if its realtime game flow might be strange for some -- it works and it's fun.", "timestamp_created": 1499499864, "timestamp_updated": 1499499864, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.626669", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33341901": {"recommendationid": "33341901", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997091485", "num_games_owned": 282, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 1415, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2, "last_played": 1514161418}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Esta obra se presenta de forma muy minimalista, pero al afirmar lo de minimalista no me refiero a que sea simple.

You can feel the chill in the icy winds, be stunned by the verdant life in the teeming underworld or move through the silent, echoing halls of the long-dead and above all, the sounds: hear the whispering sounds of dead gods in forgotten corners, your own footsteps and the shuffle of things moving behind walls: 'atmospheric' doesn't cover the half of it.\n\n\nIn addition to this, the game gives endless replayability, I would also add a solid- and terrifyingly dangerous - world: the monsters, all the way from the standard bats and rats up to the big scary stuff later on all feel unique, and are all potentially dangerous, even when you know their foibles: all it takes it one bad curse or mistep to remind you you're not invincible.\n\n\nFor all that though, there is a definite gratifying progression - you start off living off your nerves and twitch reactions, and you get solidly geared up and down your first-dozen strength potions with a healthy supply of life and healing potions and you think you're all set - and you can wade through anything!\n\n...right up until you find whatever new horror the dungeon's got lying in wait to trip you up.\n\n\nThe attention given by the developers on the forums is also excellent - regular additions of new content and bug-fixing come day-by-day. On which subject, the one area I have a few issues with - bugs. Most people seem to be able to run the game without problems - great. I'm not so fortunate, sadly. That doesn't mean I dislike how it stands, but it is a bit glitchy - and again, I hasten to point out that most people don't have any issues! \n\nNone the less, every issue I've raised has been dealt with as speedily as one could expect, and I've rarely experienced the same issue for long - and each version is smoother and cleaner with less of the issues showing.\n\n\n[h1]One playthrough (no spoilers, but lots of atmosphere):[/h1]\nI still remember my first great run - I was doing swimmingly well, geared up, health and strengthed up. Only then I came down to a dark level - so switched my shield out for a torch - of which I had a good 4 or so - so far, so good. Only I was surrounded by a [i]lot[/i] of giant rats. 'Ha! Rats!' I thought, and strolled through them as they parted round my light in a wave.\n\nThree rooms later, still surrounded by them, I began to wonder if I'd lose more than a few torches exploring this particularly ingenious labyrinth of switches, dark holes and [i]so many rats[/i]...\n\nUndeterred, I continued until I realised I'd burned through 3 torches. That got me a bit worried, so I decided to speed it up a notch and continued. As my last torch was guttering, I realised I was down to just the light of one sprite, couldn't use my shield while holding it and hadn't bothered clearing out all the rats - and now, I was stuck in a corner cause if I moved, the rats would get behind me too - and I'd left it too late to retreat up a floor.\n\nMy run ended there, and I forever learned my lesson: never [i]ever[/i] underestimate a swarm of rats :P", "timestamp_created": 1496383305, "timestamp_updated": 1496383382, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 43, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.837088", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32034273": {"recommendationid": "32034273", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999463865", "num_games_owned": 179, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 58, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495406193}, "language": "english", "review": "This game has all the moving parts of a cool action roguelike; although the game you're hoping for is here, its hidden behind a buggy, frustrating mess. \n\nThe game will stutter, slow down, and eventually freeze, even on an extremely high-end system.

This also means you can change playstyle on the fly.\n\nItem selection is nice and interesting, though a few more variations and combinations especially in magic wouldn't be unwelcome. There is a bit that can be added in future updates that I would like to see, like a more fleshed out deity and crafting system. More variation in puzzles, and more secret/hard to reach rewards that require certain effects (like fire resistance, flight/levitation, etc) would also add much to the game I think.\n\nOverall, I've had a ton of fun and can really get into playing half a dozen runs in a row trying to get just that ONE MORE achievement.

First off, the dungeons are fantastic and feel like completely unique and solidly crafted levels each time, which is a crazy feat for a roguelike.

Ultimately, you are either strong enough to beat an enemy or not, which is a little frustrated as it isn't really based on skill.  Either way, it isn't bad enough to take away from the great overall experience. * I have to ammend my review here; the new balance update fixes a lot of the problems I had with combat and makes this game even more fantastic.

I know the Cyclic Level Generator\u00ae or whatever it's called has been hyped quite a bit and for good reason. I remember reading an interview where the creator said he got the idea for it by watching his kids play in a friend or relatives house. Apparently their house had a layout where you could run around the ground floor in a circle. He saw how much more fun they had playing there than at his own home which lacked a circular layout. That's pretty brilliant. I grew up in a house like that, and I have a niece and nephew that are taking advantage of it now, so I understand how intuitive it is.

Its tough, and deep, and fair, and fun, and exciting, and brilliant. Only now after 15 hours, writing this review do I understand the brilliance in the name even. Being a roguelike the dungeon is, of course, perpetually unexplored, but I like to think that the title is referring to the game itself. For you, the new consumer, this game is unexplored. It has so many treasures and secrets and brilliant discoveries and exciting bits and pieces to experience. So go explore it.\n\nI heartily recommend this game.\n\nThat being said, be patient with it. It just launched a couple weeks ago, and its obvious from the incredible depth of the game that it is a painfully complex engine. It has its share of bugs, and technical problems.

It's a concept that's been watered down over the years, to the extent that in something like Diablo 3, it's almost entirely pointless (and I say this as someone who loves Diablo 3).\n\nIn Unexplored, every magical item starts off undentified. They can only be identified via two methods; a scroll of identification or, and this is the fun part, by using it. Unidentified weapons reveal their true natures after killing a certain amount of enemies, armour by walking a certain distance, scrolls by using them, and potions by drinking or throwing.\n\nAnd the limited inventory space means that at some point you will be forced into trying out something unidentified. This is where it shines, as you end up with something gloriously beneficial or hilariously unfortunate. It's so good to play a game that understands what this concept was originally meant to be. A true risk/reward mechanic.\n\n\nIn addition, it's so good to play a game that rewards skill and intelligent use of equipment and the environment rather than simply grinding out more power levels. Sure, occasionally it means you'll have no tools available for an encounter, but you can always run away. With there being no experience points to worry about, retreat is ALWAYS a valid tactic.\n\n\nHighly recommended, especially now. When I bought it back in February, it was good, but buggy, resulting in me shelving it for a month. Now however, it's a lot more stable. It can get a little rickety after a few hours of play, but it's quick enough to save and restart that it doesn't matter too much.\n\nAn absolute steal for the money.", "timestamp_created": 1490694788, "timestamp_updated": 1490694788, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.621866", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30788974": {"recommendationid": "30788974", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042281318", "num_games_owned": 212, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 9391, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 53, "last_played": 1513584427}, "language": "english", "review": "Unexplored creates interesting and varied procedurally generated dungeons to delve. Not only are these dungeons stocked with a variety of enemies, bosses and obstacles, but there are a great many puzzles, often with multiple solutions. Rarely have I played a game with so much random generation, but that still felt like it had been created by someone in a level editor. Many of the items you find, though they're drawn from loot tables, often feel like they've been hand placed because seemingly found loot is actually a tool for completing a puzzle. Most surprisingly to me was finding that many of these puzzles were spread over multiple levels.\n\nThough the graphics are bare bones polygons, there are a variety of environmental interactions, such as poisonous gas that can be burned off with a torch, or maybe simply explode and setting you on fire, along with vegetation, furniture and all sorts of other terrain with which to interact, offering many surprises.\n\nThe sounds are rather disappointing, but functional. The soundtrack isn't bad, though at twenty hours I was done with it.\n\nThe enemies, and most of the objects in the Dungeon of Doom, can be clicked on to bring up a description, often giving clues about them. Additionally, clicking on any object in your inventory pauses the game. Your inventory can be fully manipulated and your character re-kitted, all without missing a beat. The seeming twitch game play can be slowed down to allow for a full consideration of the situation, which I appreciated.\n\nI generally enjoyed combat, though much of melee is dependent on understanding the exact ranges of your weapons and how far they may make you move. It took a little while to get the hang of positioning (at least for me). Once I got into the swing of things, though, I found it generally responsive and rewarding.\n\nUnexplored also includes unlockable character classes, three difficulty levels, and options to add even more bosses and puzzles to the game, along with a daily dungeon and a weekly dungeon (with leaderboards for the competitive), adding replay value to the game.\n\nI did experience some glitches that dumped me out of the game.\n\nAlso, there were moments that I found myself locked in a room, one that was described as a potential death trap by a clue I'd found. Upon using the escape mechanism that the procedural generation had left for me, I found myself in an even worse situation. Occasionally these unexpected events would spiral out of control, leaving me feel cheated. I expect in rogue-likes to die, but in the good ones there are (perhaps in hindsight) clear choices that I could have made for a better outcome. Sometimes the complicated puzzle and map generation of Unexplored would combine to spit out something that felt unfair.\n\nThose negatives are small compared with all the interesting scenarios that this budget priced dungeon crawler can spin, yielding hours of fun.", "timestamp_created": 1490691208, "timestamp_updated": 1490691208, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30777037": {"recommendationid": "30777037", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052292446", "num_games_owned": 52, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 7452, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 41, "last_played": 1514062722}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm glad i bought this.

Find a blank scroll, copy an [i]Identify[/i] spell on it, use it to learn that the potion you have is [i]Levitation[/i], drink it to bypass a bridge behind which waits an ambush, fill the empty bottle with water, douse a torch near the ambush, and take out the ambushers.\n- Multiple ways of handling problems, be it brawn, stealth, using the environment, etc.\n\nDoes the game have problems?  Yes, a few:\n- There are still bugs, but the developer is great about fixing them as they are reported\n- There are still some interactions that are needed, if only because you get used to things making sense, and want to be able to do things you would never ask from other games.\n- The level generator will sometimes paint you into a corner, but once again, the developer is actively hunting down those situations.  Mostly it happens when you fall or teleport down a level, so just avoid that as much as you can\n\nBut the game is a lot more fun at its normal than it is frustrating at its worst.

It isn't easy raising your stats - since each class starts with unique gear and abilities, they all feel strong in unique ways.

Contiene fuertes influencias de otros roguelikes tradicionales, como Nethack o Angband, en el sentido de que las pociones y pergaminos que te encuentras est\u00e1n sin identificar (y var\u00edan su aspecto cada vez que inicias partida), las mazmorras se generan proceduralmente cada vez que empiezas una nueva partida y que tu \u00faltimo objetivo es recuperar el amuleto de Yendor y huir con \u00e9l. Al igual que en esos juegos, se te premia la eficiencia con la que manejas tus objetos para superar cada obst\u00e1culo, McGiver style.\n\nDe todas formas, hay que se\u00f1alar su mejor punto, y el que me hizo comprar el juego a causa de un art\u00edculo de RockPaperShotgun: Su generaci\u00f3n de mazmorras. Contiene un complejo sistema de generaci\u00f3n de niveles que hace que cada planta tenga su gracia. Por decirlo de alguna forma... Las diferentes plantas de la mazmorra no se van generando \"on the fly\", sino que ya desde el principio se elabora un plan de mazmorra, creando as\u00ed todo un mapa coherente en todos sus componentes. Por ejemplo, te puede suceder que encuentres en la 3ra planta pistas referentes a un puzzle concreto de la octava planta, o viceversa. \n\nEl hecho de que los mapas sean de buena calidad hace que \"duela\" un poquillo el que se borre el mismo y aparezca uno nuevo una vez comienzas una nueva partida, puesto que son interesantes (el juego te ofrece la opci\u00f3n de volver a jugar el mismo mapa con un nuevo personaje despu\u00e9s de morir, por si acaso).\n\nSi bien a pesar de generar buenos mapas, obviamente el juego podr\u00eda flojear en otros apartados, tales como el combate, o incluso volverse repetitivo. Unexplored pone empe\u00f1o en la generaci\u00f3n de puzzles, haciendo que valga la pena superarlos (al comenzar partida puedes incluso elegir la opci\u00f3n de generar puzzles extra, que viene acompa\u00f1ado de recompensas mayores). El combate es curioso, en el que manejas a un personaje que es circular, y tienes que llevar tus armas en ristre e impactar al enemigo movi\u00e9ndote t\u00fa hacia \u00e9l. Hay muchas armas, desde espadas y hachas, arcos o incluso l\u00e1tigos (lo normal en un juego de mazmorreo fant\u00e1stico). Por si acaso disfrutas matando enemigos (puedes ser un personaje sigiloso y esquivar muchos de ellos), tambi\u00e9n se te ofrece la opci\u00f3n de a\u00f1adir bosses extra a la mazmorra (y obviamente te dar\u00e1n m\u00e1s recompensas por ello).\n\nEn cuanto a cosas negativas del juego, est\u00e1 el soporte para mando. No es del todo correcto, puesto que no he encontrado manera de examinar a los enemigos, cosa que veo esencial, aunque tambi\u00e9n es cierto que en la p\u00e1gina de la tienda ya te avisan de que el soporte para controlador es parcial, y de todas formas, con teclado y rat\u00f3n el juego se controla bien, aunque inexplicablemente a veces el personaje me recoge objetos de manera autom\u00e1tica y a veces no (EDITO: Esto es en realidad una opci\u00f3n del juego, que hace que te recoja ciertos objetos de manera autom\u00e1tica si detienes a tu personaje).\n\nEn resumidas cuentas, es un juego que ofrece, bajo mi impresi\u00f3n, mucho valor a\u00f1adido para valer 10 euros, aunque a\u00fan estoy por acab\u00e1rmelo para ver todo el contenido.

Unexplored is a rather classical approach to the rogue-like genre, that happens to be bundled with one of the best seed based dungeon generators I've seen. Heck, it's probably better than Daggerfall's. *cough*\nJoke aside, it's really good. It will generate huge-ish, interconnected levels, with interesting puzzles, and after 30+ hours spent in it, I've never found a level that wasn't solvable. I've encountered a few bugs, but that was a couple of releases ago and the devs seem to have committed to update the game regularly.\nThe loot is great and can be plentiful depending on the seed, and while there is no character leveling per-se, there is character progression by the way of potions and magical items. So that's good. There are several character classes to choose from, although you'll have to unlock them by performing diverse feats during gameplay.\nThe graphics, while not exactly breath-taking gorgeous, serve their purpose efficiently in that  everything is clearly presented and you'll have no problem identifying an enemy, a trap or a piece of treasure. The sound design is of the same vein, with a special mention for the musics, which manage to support the ambiance, building the tension when there's danger around, slowing down when you're in a peaceful place, all the while sounding pretty good, in my opinion. I get tired of in game music really easilly in most games, and after 30 hours, I still haven't turned them off. That must mean something, however subjective music tastes are.\nBut I digress... game is great, definitely has more to it than meets the eye, especially at $10/10euros.

For those who consider options menus a concern, there are the expected basic resolution and fullscreen/window options, separate sliders for music in audio, and remappable control schemes. You can also switch between absolute and relative movement, which is a nice option to have. Ambient sounds and combat are well done and provide useful info to the player, the soundtrack is good but not particularly memorable (good background music). \n\nThe gameplay is where it's roots show particularly strongly - a core game focused strongly on randomised dungeons, puzzles and items, with a simple but technical combat style. There are options catering to more combat oriented players (by generating more bossfights and combat heavy dungeons) and for more puzzle oriented players; not to mention your regular easy/normal/hard difficulties. You can also just leave it at stock standard for a balanced game. \n\nThere is permadeath and you'll quickly find yourself on Rodney XV but that's part of the experience for roguelikes. There's a successor based progression system in place rather than leveling up, which may put off some but helps make the game more approachable, as stats and more advanced concepts don't matter quite as much until you've got a few dead adventurers under your belt. The achievement system gives you actual in game rewards in the form of unlockable equipment - for example killing 20 enemies with the same dagger unlocks the option to buy an extra dagger at the beginning of each run.\n\nOverall an enjoyably frustrating experience, where dying is generally clearly your own fault, and with enough variety to keep you coming back for more. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1488578540, "timestamp_updated": 1488578540, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502297", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30298617": {"recommendationid": "30298617", "author": {"steamid": "76561197982876792", "num_games_owned": 342, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 913, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495282788}, "language": "english", "review": "An interesting take on the roguelike formula.

So I bought and here are my thoughts: This game has a lot of cool things going for it, really interesting dungeon generation, fun realtime/skill based combat and lots of cool mechanics that interact with each other the more you learn and play. But the game also suffers from some design flaws, bugs, and imo hard to understand graphics, clunky ui and monotonous sound. The biggest issue so far is some really bad lag spikes or frame drops, which has killed me a fair few times. The devs does seem like a very passionate person and very active in the forum, but we will have to wait and see for how long. So to the conclusion, I do really like the game because it innovates in an otherwise crowded and sometimes stale genre, but I hope some of the bugs and design flaws gets fleshed out a bit in the future.

It exceeded my expectations my a couple of miles.\n\nWhile I'm still not entirely sold on the whole \"Cyclical Level Generation\" thing since it seems like the algorithm produces roughly the same quality of levels as other long-running roguelikes, the game itself is a solid action-roguelike with a good amount of content for an Early Access game. And when I say action-roguelike, I do mean that as this is exactly how I'd imagine a game like Brogue or DCSS would look and play if it were translated directly into a top down real time action game.\n\nThis being said, the system requirements are a bit higher than you'd expect since the game is not in fact fully 2D but a highly sylized 3D with some sprites mixed in. Also it can get a little hard to figure out what to do in certain parts of the levels (switch/key hunts abound if you turn on the \"More Puzzles\" option) though some might take it as a plus. If you've played a classic FPS it'll be nothing to you. I'm looking forward to seeing where this goes, but even now the interactions between the systems and the gameplay make for an interesting experience. Just before posting this review I managed to find a poison gas staff, and kept blowing up rooms full of enemies by flooding them with gas and chucking torches in.

Smooth controls.  Excellent use of terrain/traps/objects in strategy for defeating harder monsters.  Variety of monsters is great, often requiring very different strategies.  Good crafting/enhancement system).  Different level styles (water level, lava level, level filled with razor sharp walls that you have to be careful not to touch).

Once because I saved the game(upon load, it was just corrupted), and another when I loaded into a new area(game chrashed, and is now corrupted).\n\nThere's also a pretty annoying memory leak the devs really need to fix(starts stuttering after you've been ingame for a couple of hours. Is fixed by rebooting the game).\n\nBut like I said, the game itself is fun, and quite addictive. If you're into rogue dungeon crawlers, this could be that gem you're looking for.\n\nBut as it stands now, I'd say wait a few months, see if the bugs and stuff are less, then get it. As it is now, I can not recommend it.", "timestamp_created": 1488058394, "timestamp_updated": 1488221087, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522664", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30177415": {"recommendationid": "30177415", "author": {"steamid": "76561198093528914", "num_games_owned": 112, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 859, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510097481}, "language": "english", "review": "Best roguelite i've played.", "timestamp_created": 1488055562, "timestamp_updated": 1488055562, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.460614", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30174097": {"recommendationid": "30174097", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013336701", "num_games_owned": 104, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 741, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495314294}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a fun game and a bargain at twice the price.

Remember though, that not all of these necessarily lead to the \u201ddeeper dungeon\u201d so you might have to backtrack.

Literally every pro in this game is related to this point. It's frankly incredible how each floor establishes its own identity and is able to connect with the other floors in the game. You will recieve clues in upper floors for how to solve puzzles in lower floors and vice versa. Accessing new areas sometimes requires items, and as you explore floors you will open shortcuts for ease of backtracking. The levels (fully generated game) often [i]actually[/i] do feel like they were hand built. I want anyone reading this review to think about how crazy that is.\n\n[b] Cons: [/b]\nIn relation to combat, this game tries to be too many things and doesn't do any of them very well imo. It has stealth elements, but they feel tacked on and the enemy AI isn't smart enough to make stealth interesting. It has melee combat, but most of the weapons I've seen so far feel very samey. You can modify your weapons on an anvil to give them different kinds of buffs, but so far it doesn't change the way weapons feel and the feeling in all combat situations is that it's kind of unsatisfying. It has ranged weapons, but again, killing things doesn't feel satisfying. I can't say exactly what the problem is for me in this regard, but at least part of it is the poor sound design. If you play enter the gungeon, that game has great sound design. Shooting guns and killing guys feels so good, and this game doesn't capture that feeling. Also, scrolls and potions starting unidentified is a common thing in most roguelikes, but I hate that concept in every single one. You have to waste your first potion throwing it on an enemy to see what it does. Why is that necessary/fun?\n\n[b] Final Verdict 6.8/10: [/b]\nThis is another game where I wish steam had a neutral review button, but since it doesn't, I'm going to round up. The game is called Unexplored, so exploration is what its focus is supposed to be on, and exploration is undeniably really incredible because of the amazing level generator. Unfortunately, some of the underlying mechanics, especially in relation to combat, feel lacking and don't do the level generator justice. Ultimately I give it a thumbs up because exploring new areas and seeing what puzzles are there really is impressive enough that I am going to keep playing this game.\n\nedit: The more I play this game, the more I like it. 6.8 out of 10 is too low. Probably closer to an 8 for me now. The level generator blows my mind at least once every time I play. Never had the same kind of run more than once. So much variety and so well generated. \n\nEDIT 2: Still the more I play this game, I like it even more! The game is probably above a 9 for me now. The game doesn't showcase/demo well imo because of its unglamorous art, but it is so fun to explore and to outsmart the enemies. If you have never seen person of interest, there is a machine that keeps track of every person and can micromanage large schemes together even though it is a black box to its users and that's what makes the show interesting. The level generator in this game feels like that machine watching your every move and keeping the game fair for you until you do something irreparably stupid at which point it kills you and tells you to try again.

An innovative new control scheme, menu navigation method, and combat system (they're all one in the same, really) that works, and works well. Pretty cute art, mechanics that will help new players like auto-looting and automatically quaffing potions of healing when necessary, and plenty of challenge for people used to roguelites. People also really seem to be into daily challenge runs for whatever reason, and this game has them, although there seems to be a bug where starting a daily run, finishing it, and then starting a new normal character will sometimes still cause the new character to be on the daily challenge. There is a setting for random seed versus use last seed, and I think use last seed gets selected when you play the daily/weekly challenge - make sure you're checking the option you want when you start a new game.\n\nI also want to point out that the dungeon generation is awesome! The environments are some of the most interesting and varied I've ever seen in a game like this. It does generate impossible circumstances more often than I'd like it to, though - I just recently got trapped in a room that was only opened by a pressure switch outside, with no way of getting out. The enchanting system is also great, a big improvement on some of the convoluted crafting systems of other games. The rarity of runes and the sometimes useful, always interesting effect they have on your equipment is lots of fun to play with.\n\nAfter an hour and a half of playing, though, the game began to pause and hang for two to four seconds at a time. It never caused me to die \"unfairly\" but was not fun at all to play with. You may also want to disable the fixed time step option if you're having screen tearing in spite of vsync being on, it helped me. Those two things, and the little quirk about seed selection, were the only problems I had with this game.

dont even pass for 'rogue-lite' but this one is the real deal. its true, it might not meet the strictest definition since it is real time and not turn-based, but this is a rare example of a roguelike that isnt, in my opinion, disqualified by it.\n\nunexplored feels very much like a graphical version of Brogue (and if youre a roguelike fan, this alone should be reason enough to insta-buy). it has a similarly pared-down set of mechanics, eschewing the complexity of more common roguelikes for a more streamlined experience that keeps things simple without sacrificing the strategic depth that keeps a roguelike interesting.\n\nthere is no experience, no leveling. your character is developed through a combination of strength potions and equipment choices, again along the lines of brogue. strength allows you to use a wider variety of equipment, and equipment allows you to enhance the various attributes of your character through enchanting, forging, and lucky drops. each run will have its share of high-powered equipment, usually locked away behind some combination of puzzles and challenges, as well as a scattered mix of items with lesser enhancements, and this will largely determine how you go about approaching each run... one run you might get a lot of fire-resist gear that might lead you to hoard fire-starting potions and items with an eye towards burning out most of the monsters... another might find you with a lot of speed and stealth gear encouraging hit and run tactics. also, monsters can frequently use the same equipment you can, sometimes to great (or hilarious) effect.\n\ndungeon and level generation is where the game really shines, with a nice variety of layouts that sometimes require real thought or skill to navigate, as well as branching paths and multi-floor puzzles. in many ways the dungeon itself is the main adversary, and almost every run features at least one floor or set of floors that makes you just pull your hair and want to scream at the screen.  it is at times hard to believe the floors are randomly generated, since the generator does such a great job at really putting you in some sticky situations with some devious combinations of traps, layouts, switches, and the like... and does an especially good job of continually forcing you to make the risk vs reward decisions that are a core part of every good roguelike.\n\nunexplored is very hard, but for the most part very fair. when you die, its pretty much always your fault. you know that somewhere down the line you made a mistake that cost you the game. im pretty experienced with these kinds of games, and reasonably good at them, and i still havent managed to win a game yet (although i HAVE managed to get the magical macguffin at the buttom of the dungeon).\n\nin fairness, there ARE bugs, mostly with the level generation... for me, it often fails, usually forcing me to restart. this is frustrating, but the lead developer is super responsive with fixing these bugs and rolling out updates, so i am confident that in time these issues will all get worked out.\n\nbottom line, if youre a fan of the genre, this game is worth every penny, and i can recommend it

Apparantly showing up in August, yet I'd never seen it even once until Steam randomly threw it at me recently (stupid overloaded store...).  And that's a bloody shame: I buy alot of different games pretty often, but of all of them I've gotten this year, this is probably the one that deserves the most attention by far.  Hopefully, perhaps this review can help to convince some more people to buy it.\n\nUnexplored is an action roguelike (as in, real-time) that creates a very detailed and interesting world for you to explore, as you control your amorphous one-eyed blob of a character (???) throughout an extremely intricate dungeon full of traps, monsters, exploding things, and all sorts of junk that you'd expect to find in a horrible dungeon of doom.  The Amulet of Yendor (which apparently is like the greatest thing ever, according to roguelikes) is your goal, which needless to say is at the bottom of this horrible death pit.\n\nAnd that horrible death pit is one of the big draws of this game.  Possibly the game's most striking feature is the dungeon itself.  Using something called \"cyclic generation\", the game creates all sorts of amazingly complicated floors that tend to feel hand-crafted rather than purely random.  This fascinates me to no end, and it ensures that each floor is INTERESTING.  But it goes a bit further than that.  For example, the idea of a lock and a key... pretty familar, right?  Well... not always.  The game takes the idea of a lock and key and abstracts them (is that the right word?).  The \"lock\" might be a hideous room of death turrets.  The \"key\" might be a potion of invisibility that you found elsewhere, allowing you to bypass the turrets safely.  Or perhaps you're in a dungeon floor filled with chasms, and you find out that the exit is COMPLETELY blocked off in it's own seperate room... you cant get in there.  However, the game has been handing you a bunch of ropes, which can be used to climb down into the abyss and onto the next floor.  And from there, if you find the stairs that go back UP to the exit you couldnt reach, you might find a powerful item in that closed off room.   These are just a couple of examples of the fascinating situations that the game will create for you.  There's all sorts of interesting stuff that can happen.  \n\nAnd going along with this, there's all sorts of interesting items to get too.  Many items are relatively familiar... you've got your equipment (armor, weapons, magic rings), your potions and scrolls (often unidentified when picked up, but not ALWAYS... and this aspect is soooo much more managable than in things like Nethack), magical staves, and all sorts of things.  The game tends to encourage you to actually USE these things.  Not just to get through those \"lock\" situations, but for any situation you might find yourself in, chances are you have some tools that can help you.  Even negative items (bad potions for example) can help you... that horrible potion that produces a poison cloud could wreck you if you actually drink it, but instead of doing that, you could open a door into a room filled with monsters, fling the potion in, and close the door, letting the room fill with gas, slowly killing everything inside; needless to say, this sort of thing is entertaining as heck to do.  Speaking of gas: there are various types, many of which can be ignited, and some of which do funky things.  This game being as amazingly detailed as it is, there is even wind that can blow the stuff around.  There's also water to wade through and swim in, which can really change up a situation fast (particularly if it's murky water... beware of the hard-to-see Bog Worms).  The environment and area types really add to any situation that may already be there in what is already a very complicated dungeon.\n\nAnd it's a dangerous place, too.  Monsters and sword-wielding jerks everywhere.  This game has quite the enemy variety... there's tons of different monsters.  Combat with these foes is rather slow, careful, and calculated.  Each individual enemy is it's own unique threat... this isnt the sort of game where you're going to dash through a room, guns blazing, killing 20 monsters in the blink of an eye.  You have to be careful here... time your swings/stabs properly, watch the enemy's movement, keep track of your surroundings, and make sure you're using your items well, as most foes can mess you up pretty badly if they get the best of you.  You have many methods of attacking your foes, as well as defending against them, and combat can get pretty tactical.  It gets especially loopy if there's a number of foes around at once... in a game where a fight with just one enemy often is careful and calculated, you REALLY dont want to be surrounded by 5 axe-wielding orcs, or something like that.  You need to keep track of your surroundings, and plan your movements.  Get the drop on the enemy (there is a stealth system!), dont let them get the drop on you.  Combat, overall, is pretty darned fun and satisfying, and the sheer enemy variety combined with everything else keeps it that way.\n\nOne nice quality-of-life bit is your health potions:  You dont have to worry about forgetting to use these.  When your HP gets super low, one of them will automatically fire off for you.  This is a good thing, as you already have a squillion other things to worry about.  Dying simply because you didnt click your health potion would be stupidly irritating.\n\nAnd did I mention the traps?  All sorts of horrid things.  Turrets, gas vents, you name it.  Deadly things, all of them.  Exploring the level though can sometimes find you switches that shut down traps in key positions... offering you even more reason to explore this detailed world.  Be warned: this is not an easy game.  You will die, sometimes in hilarious ways (dont drink exploding potions... just dont).  There are, however, multiple difficulty options to choose from, a rarity in roguelikes.  And the game is never unfair... it always gives you the tools, you just have to figure out the best way to use them.\n\nAnd detailed it is.  There are even books you can find, written by previous adventurers, which may mention things like a secret room containing a Cloak of Movement on the 6th floor, giving you a clue that you can use later.  This is a very polished game filled with tons of things both major and minor, and even the smallest bits shine with quality.\n\nThere's even some crafting, if you find things like forge or alchemy stations.  You can make some useful stuff here... IF you have the right items.\n\nNow, it is worth noting that the game IS still in early access as of this review... but it's so very polished and just outright good that it easily outdoes tons of completely finished game.  And the developer is very helpful and interacts with the community, and clearly cares about the project and the people playing it... so that helps even further.   I can say though that I have not run into many genuine bugs in this game; this is a very stable game, despite being in EA status.\n\nAll in all, I've been playing this one to death, and this might really be my \"game of the year\".  And considering the sheer number of games that I buy, that's quite the feat.  But honestly, it's THAT good, and I'm just having that much fun with it.  I cant recommend this one enough.

The way it works is that you can purchase some equipment at the start with gold you collected the previous times.\n\nI'm pleased with the purchase.  You explore dungeon levels trying to find the stairs down.  Some doors need keys, some need levers pulled.  Later floors have patrols of orcs marching around, and you can ambush them as they stray from their patrol group.  There are traps, teleporters and invincible defence creatures that need to be deactivated by finding switches.\n\nAs you explore you find potions, spells, armour, weapons and magical jewelry,  They all start of unknown and you need to risk nasty things happening by trying them.  There is an identify magic spell although currently they seem to be in short supply.  You can also enchant your items, and some items need higher strength which you get from strength potions (and a nice system where you can use weapons you are too weak to use by not having anything in your second hand).\n\nCombat is quite simple, a bit like Gunball for those that played that flash game.  It's an enjoyable experience, where you need to use strategy more than reflexes in combat.\n\nEasy mode is actually quite easy.  I died a couple of initial times learning the game, but then on my third try I am down to level 16 in what has been quite a long game.  Since there are no permanent upgrades to grind I don't currently see what incentive I will have to try playing on a harder mode.\n\nThere are some bugs in the game.  In 4 hours I have noticed:\n- The graphics start to glitch if you jump briefly to another window while playing, and that glitch remains if you continue that character even if you restart the game.  So currently avoid changing window.\n- My game has crashed a couple of times while playing.  Possibly when several things happen at once such as looking in a cupboard while a nearby orc spots me.  But the game seems to continue ok when restarting.\nI guess a crash per one or two hours is not a serious issue for an early access game.\n\nOverall a great game I would recommend.  I would like to request the developer considers some permanent grind benefits rather than just temporary purchases.  Eg.\n- X gold to have a 20% change to automatically identify a particular spell/potion when you first come across it.  Then increasing costs to increase that percentage chance towards 100%.  With a large variety of scrolls and potions that would give me plenty of grinding targets.\n- X gold to increase the mix of particular positive potions/spells I like (such as identify magic / remove curse).

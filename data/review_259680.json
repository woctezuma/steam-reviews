In fact, I enjoy following some of the dungeon lore, and hasn't come to find lore notes that are particularly annoying or inconsistently written. Gameplay is fun, but let's talk about it in a series of pros and cons:\n\nPros\n- Relatively balanced race / classes with different play styles\n- Enemies don't respawn, meaning you *probably* don't need to grind\n- Decent amount of side quest and extra dungeon\n- Mode with extra lives for those who suck at roguelike, like me\n- Hackable, with a crap ton of addons already out there\n\nCons\n- It's pretty barebones, and might be hard to get into. You may need to get past tier-1 dungeons several times and play with different classes to fully grasp what you're really doing in this game.\n- Steep difficulty increase with little to no warning in some areas\n\nIt's well-made, and it's worth the price.

You start the game with a very limited selection of races and classes, and then must unlock the others as you play. \n\nThat prelude said, the game is relatively linear in that you pick a race and class and start at Level 1. You move through tiered dungeons that never change. The content within them is relatively random except for the dungeon bosses, however the dungeons themselves and the order in which you move through them tends to always stay the same no matter how many times you have been through them or which character you play. The only thing that really does change is the race/class and the points you spend in them as you level up. This is constrained by the fact that certain class/race builds tend to always be more successful than others. In addition, one race in particular - Shalore - is very overpowered making some of the classes you play as Shalore basically an automatic game winner.\n\nThe main developer Dark God is very responsive to the community and he works as a volunteer, as is customary in most Open Source projects. You can donate to the game if you like it to help support his efforts. The game is user friendly for Linux and MAC as well.\n\nThe games cons are its inflexiblity and redundant nature.

ToME is my first rogue-like, and what attracted me to it was the fact that it looks like the love child of a SRPG and an ARPG.  If that sounds good to you, let me tell you that it really delivers on that promise.  This is essentially a single character game of Final Fantasy Tactics staged across a series of Diablo dungeons.  I love it.\n\nI have hundreds of hours logged so far, and even though I've won a few times, I still feel like I have lots to do if only because of the sheer number of classes and achievements, not to mention that I've yet to move beyond the Normal difficulty level or try any of the numerous community developed add-ons.  Even so, I'm well aware of just how flexible the add-ons make the game.  If you like unlocking everything yourself as I do, there's a fair number of unlocks to chase, but if you want all the classes immediately, you can get the add-on that does that.  Play how you want to!\n\nSpeaking on which, if you are turned off by by the idea of a rogue-like but otherwise think this looks interesting, it's worth knowing that the default mode is the more forgiving \"Adventure\" mode, which is more akin to the limited continues of an old-school NES game.  The game remains hard, but with some practice, a few extra lifes prove to be a pretty good cushion.

TOME is the definition of a modern classic Roguelike.

I have spent way too much time considering which skill to take and then regretting my decisions later. Those regrets do diminish over time as I get better at choosing.\n\nI could write a long review. So much of TOME is deep and takes quite a while to understand. It's very easy to get into, though, and I can easily recommend TOME to anyone. Go download the game for free from the te4.org website.

The acessible graphics and interface helped, but what truly sets ToME apart is how it blends the roguelike formula with more traditional RPG elements AND an amazing tactical turn-based combat.\n\nFirst, it's a roguelike, but you unlock new classses and races as you play, so there's a sense a progression things even if you die. And if you don't enjoy losing your character you can disable permadeth - or give youself some extra lives.\n\nThe world is fixed, but races/classes have different starting points and many quests have multiple solutions, so there's always something new to see or try in each playthrough. In one your Psionic Dwarf might become a mage hunter that vows to never use magic items, in the other your Elven Necromancer might join an evil warlock and raid the mage hunters.\n\nFinally, the classes, races and items are all designed to offer you plenty of choices in combat. ToME will throw crazy challenges at you, but it also offers crazy powers - travel back in time, turn into a demon, redirect damage, teleport, raise walls, summon tsunamis, become a lich, etc. It's never about level or DPS - what's important is using your skills wisely.   \n\nSo if you always wanted to try a roguelike but ADOM, NetHack and other classics never got you hooked, try ToME. :)", "timestamp_created": 1511419110, "timestamp_updated": 1511419349, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.703073", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36943933": {"recommendationid": "36943933", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081085693", "num_games_owned": 275, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 155, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511414867}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is very good old-school rogue-like that combines elements of rpgs into the mix to make what was old seem fresh again through some great presentation, good loot, good mod support, and all for a good price.", "timestamp_created": 1511414921, "timestamp_updated": 1511414921, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36925321": {"recommendationid": "36925321", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088846650", "num_games_owned": 140, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 16775, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512098189}, "language": "schinese", "review": "2017\u5e74\u79cb\u5b63\u7279\u5356\u6295\u7968Nothing Is Impossible\u5956", "timestamp_created": 1511410251, "timestamp_updated": 1511410251, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36914486": {"recommendationid": "36914486", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010933049", "num_games_owned": 65, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 1882, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511407131}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4ece\u5f53\u5e74\u73a9\u76d7\u7248\u5230\u73b0\u5728\u5165\u6b63\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e48\u591a\u5e74\u5076\u5c14\u90fd\u8fd8\u4f1a\u6253\u5f00\u73a9\u73a9\uff0c\u771f\u7684\u662f\u5f88\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u7684\u72ec\u7acb\u6e38\u620f\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1511407375, "timestamp_updated": 1511407375, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36907167": {"recommendationid": "36907167", "author": {"steamid": "76561198259302311", "num_games_owned": 4, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2821, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512258110}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is a Roguelike game.

A melhor forma de descrever o tome 4 seria como um roguelike super tunado, isso porque al\u00e9m das caracter\u00edsticas comuns aos jogo estilo rogue como morte permanente e calabou\u00e7os gerados a cada partida, ele ainda possui melhorias como gr\u00e1ficos caprichados ainda que sejam apenas tiles, possui \u00e1udio dos monstros e espadas em combates, alem de possuir um tema musical muito gostoso de se ouvir enquanto \u00e9 jogado. \nMas as melhorias que realmente me impressionaram no tome 4 \u00e9 o fato do jogo ser mundo aberto, diferente de outros roguelikes como stone soup, onde voc\u00ea explora apenas uma masmorra. Outro ponto interessante \u00e9 o game tamb\u00e9m possuir quests e trama interligando todos os acontecimentos.\nOutra inova\u00e7\u00e3o do tome 4 \u00e9 o jogo possuir recursos online. Deixa eu explicar. Voc\u00ea infelizmente n\u00e3o vai poder jogar cooperativamente com outros players, nem desafia-los, mas poder\u00e1 se comunicar com outros players em tempo real, seja para pedir dicas ou comemorar quando matar um monstro poderoso. O modo online tamb\u00e9m comunica a todos os jogadores de forma autom\u00e1tica quando um determinado player completa uma quest, passa de level ou encontra algum segredo. E o melhor, ele grava todas as informa\u00e7\u00f5es do seu jogo no site do tome 4, l\u00e1 voc\u00ea pode comparar seu personagem com o de outros amigos e at\u00e9 estimular uma disputa para ver quem consegue evoluir e ir o mais longe poss\u00edvel.\nO jogo n\u00e3o \u00e9 t\u00e3o dif\u00edcil como seu irm\u00e3o stone soup. Mas est\u00e1 longe de ser uma baba, os jogadores casuais v\u00e3o sofrer um pouco no inicio, mas v\u00e3o se apaixonar quando entender o funcionamento. Para finalizar gostaria de dar algumas dicas ao jogadores iniciantes:\nAlgumas classes s\u00e3o desbloqueadas ap\u00f3s jogatinas no game, ent\u00e3o fique esperto para explorar o m\u00e1ximo que conseguir, isso te garantir\u00e1 mais op\u00e7\u00f5es de escolha de classes em futuros games.\nAbuse das suas skills, elas s\u00e3o importantes para te manter vivo em muitas batalhas.\nEvite carregar tudo que encontrar nos calabou\u00e7os, leve apenas o que encontrar de valor, isso evita voc\u00ea ficar pesado e receber penalidades em combates.\nAperte J no teclado para abrir as quests dispon\u00edveis, siga a ordem delas para evitar entrar em uma \u00e1rea com monstros muito fortes para seu level.\nVenda sempre seu loot na cidade para conseguir mais dinheiro para equipamentos.\nEvite lutar com v\u00e1rios monstros de uma s\u00f3 vez, busque no cenario locais onde possa enfrentar um por um.\nRecomendo o jogo para todos aqueles que adoram jogos de explora\u00e7\u00e3o no estilo rogue.

Being helpless she struck her rune of random teleportation and vanished from the vampires eyes!\n\nOnly to appear smack in the middle in a huge oval room filled to the brim with HUGE spiders, still disarmed and off balance. She managed to survive by jumping over six ranks of spiders into a corridor and fighting them one by one but it was some frantic combat.\n\n2) Walking in an empty room my archer walked to the far wall where some items where on the floor, avoiding a so called lava floor in the middle. When she picked up an item four walls slid back and four powerfull orcish mages surrounded her utterly. Surrounded by four spellcaster who could toast her easily (she couldnt shoot more then one due to their placing and they had heaps of status affects that would completely render her helpless) she used her rune and vanished!\n\nOnly to re-appear in the same room smack in the middle of the lava ground, still surrounded by no doubt snickering orcish mages.

The music is good to boot!\n\nThen I press the \"New Game\" button and prepare myself to create my very first character.  Sitting at the edge of my seat my imagination goes wild with the vast array of possibilities. \nThen the best part, the screen goes black and fidgets and the game pops up with a \"an error has occured\" page and asks if I would like to report it.  Being of sound mind and body, I decide to report it.  The game then restarts and I am free to roam the menus free from errors once again.\n\nIn closing I will say that this game is a wonderful addition to the burgeoning Menu Simulator genre.  A genre that I truly hope continues to grow as game developers show love and attention in creating games that function properly.\n\nNote: I will expand this review if and when I get the game to run as advertised.  Furthermore,  I will change this to review to recommend the game if one of two things happens.\n1. If the game developer changes the genre to \"Fantasy Menu Simulator\" and advertises it as such. OR\n2. If a patch comes out, making it so that as a consumer I do not need to immediately fix the \"finished\" product I have purchased and the game is indeed as fun as it looks.\n\nAs it sits, based on my experience I cannot recommend this game even if it were free.  Due to the fact that from my current expercience and perspective I would be telling people to install a game that cannot make it past the menu.\n\nEdit: Thanks to a very helpful fan of the game I have found out that the game is indeed free and you may find it at https://te4.org\n\nHowever, this does not change my opinion.  I cannot recommend spending time trying to get a game to run that has been out since 2012, and has been actively updated and patched since that time (again huge props to the dev for that) but still is difficult to get running on a mid-level gaming PC.  I understand some long standing fans will disagree with me, and that is fine, this is a free country after all.\n\nFinal Edit: Clearly the fans of this game are dedicated.  So, if this game can inspire the kind of loyalty I witnessed since writing one long-winded negative review than it must be a good game, because the mob is never wrong. Thank you.

DEPTH - This game is the holy grail of roguelikes, a hidden diamond in the rough -- if you like the roguelike genre at all and don't have this game, buy it immediately. The depth is insane and best of all it manages to break out of the \"fantasy\" clich\u00e9 of classes while still maintaining core principles of a turn based roguelike. Some of the concepts are so foreign that you won't initially understand the mechanics and you're like \"what the actual #$%& does this do\", but once you learn the mechanics they add a whole new layer of fun to the game that's all but lost in games today.\n\n2. MECHANICS - It's like nothing you've ever seen. Each class and race is eerily unique in several ways and is filled with all kinds of new and interesting ideas. \u201cWait, I can melee with mind abilities?\u201d\n\n3. ITEMIZATION - Lots of gear, lots of stats, lots of resist types, lots of damage types, lots of status effects, lots of \"hmmm I wonder if this piece is better\" or \"I really should put these points into health, but I can't say no to more damage and if I kill them fast, they can\u2019t hurt me! Right?\"  Changing gear usually requires a compromise of offense, defense and knowledge of what your character can handle.\n\n4. CHALLENGE - Took me ~85 gameplay hours to beat the game on Normal, I probably lost 20-30 characters before successfully winning. It's possible that I'm just really bad, but I like to think the game is just really challenging. Also, the beginning of the game is not easy, it's quite difficult; I remember thinking \"Wow I just died 3 times in the first starting zone.\"\n\n5. SKILLS - A huge variety of skills, trees, opportunities and playstyles. This makes for fun and inventive combos, skill synergy and interesting deaths. \"Hellll yeah I got a skill that lets me move through walls, oh #$%! I just suffocated in the wall.\"\n\n6. MONSTERS - A massive monster variety, each time you play you'll start to notice the different monster types, their skills, strengths and weaknesses. On higher difficulties, it's extremely important to know what you're going up against to get that next level advantage. \u201cOHHHH #$%* another necromancer.\u201d\n\n7. ACTIVE DEV & COMMUNITY - Active development on the game, balance patches, new classes, races, and content (DLC). The community is great, can be very helpful and from my experience non-toxic (I guess we're not call of duty scrubs). As a bonus, every now and then you'll see messages from the DarkGod (DEV) who bestows you with some random buff for \"absolutely no reason.\"\n\n8. DEATH - You will die a lot. You will rage. You will learn from your mistakes. You will make the same mistakes again, die, and rage more. You will lose multiple lives to the same monster because you\u2019re too stubborn to choose the \u201csafe\u201d option when talking to the ghost lady after you die. You will switch to another class because the one you were playing before felt 'weak' and this other class has GOT to be better, but then later go back to the first class because you now understand that it's really strong and you were just bad. You will die to the first boss in the first zone ON NORMAL and come to some inevitable realizations about how the game is meant to be played. You\u2019ll say to yourself -- \"WELP that guy just 1 shot me for 1565 blight damage, when I only had 923 heath good to know I stood a chance; probably should have more than 11% blight resist.\"\n\n9.

En dehors de la sant\u00e9, tr\u00e8s peu de classes ont des ressources en commun, certaines utilisent le mana, certaines l'endurance, d'autres l'\u00e9quilibrium, d'autres encore un m\u00e9lange de plusieurs, etc. ce qui pourrait para\u00eetre un gadget si chacune n'avait pas sa mani\u00e8re de fonctionner. Par exemple pour regagner l'endurance, il suffit d'attendre sans l'utiliser par contre pour l'\u00e9quilibrium, il d\u00e9marre \u00e0 0 et plus il est \u00e9lev\u00e9 plus les comp\u00e9tences lanc\u00e9es avec ont de chance d'\u00e9chouer. Les classes sont donc bien diff\u00e9rentes les unes et autres et souvent elles ont m\u00eame plusieurs mani\u00e8res d'\u00eatre jou\u00e9es, ce qui laisse \u00e0 penser que tout le monde pourra trouver son style. Un avertissement cependant, certaines classes sont (de mon avis personnel) plus ou moins puissantes ce qui permet d'une certaine mani\u00e8re de moduler la difficult\u00e9 mais \u00e7a peut aussi surprendre parfois.\n\n+ Et d'ailleurs, maintenant que j'en parle de la difficult\u00e9, sachez qu'elle est au rendez-vous. Dans ToME, il n'y a pas cette sensation des premiers niveaux difficiles et une fois qu'on a mont\u00e9 son perso on roule sur tout le monde. Que nenni, on trouvera toujours un challenge \u00e0 sa hauteur (en sachant que je n'ai jamais fini le jeu je m'avance peut \u00eatre un peu mais je ne pense pas). Plus votre perso est complexe et peut g\u00e9rer de situations probl\u00e9matiques, plus l'\u00e9ventail de ces situations sera large et simultan\u00e9.\n\n+ Un autre grand atout de ce jeu, c'est tout ce qu'on peut d\u00e9bloquer. \u00c7a peut aller d'un nouvel \u00e9l\u00e9ment \u00e0 utiliser pour les mages \u00e0 un nouveau mode de jeu en passant par de nouvelles races et classes. C'est toujours un plaisir de d\u00e9bloquer un nouvel \u00e9l\u00e9ment dans ce jeu et \u00e7a se fait souvent au prix de longs efforts et d'exp\u00e9riences r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9es de morts approch\u00e9es.\n\n+ Un aspect de ce jeu que j'aime particuli\u00e8rement, c'est le lore. Je trouve l'univers de ce jeu r\u00e9ellement int\u00e9ressant et avec des choix dans l'histoire du monde que je n'ai pas vu souvent, voire jamais. Je ne m'\u00e9tendrais pas plus sur ce sujet, je vous laisse d\u00e9couvrir...\n\n+ Et je n'ai pas encore abord\u00e9 la chose la plus incroyable dans ce jeu : vous pouvez y jouer gratuitement avec seulement quelques options en moins (une classe et deux campagnes il me semble) en le t\u00e9l\u00e9chargeant sur le site officiel. De quoi vous laisser l'essayer autant que vous voulez avant de soutenir ou pas ce jeu (ce que j'ai fait par ailleurs).\n\n- Ceci dit, je ne suis pas pay\u00e9 par l'\u00e9diteur pour vous servir uniquement des compliments b\u00e9ats, il y a aussi des d\u00e9fauts dans ce jeu. Le premier qui me vient en t\u00eate, c'est vraiment le niveau des qu\u00eates. Autant je suis fan de l'univers et je d\u00e9vore tout le lore que je trouve, autant les seuls quelques personnages qui vont vous adresser la parole en dehors de la qu\u00eate principale sont tout droit sortis d'un mauvais sc\u00e9nar de donjons & dragons. Hormis une ou deux qu\u00eates travaill\u00e9es il n'y a pas grand chose.\n\n- Un autre point n\u00e9gatif c'est la difficult\u00e9 qu'on peut \u00e9prouver parfois quand on doit choisir entre deux \u00e9quipements. Les stats sont l\u00e9gions et \u00e0 moins de savoir exactement ce qu'on cherche, \u00e7a peut rapidement devenir infernal.\n\n- Le dernier point qui me semble important, c'est la frustration que ce jeu peut apporter. C'est tr\u00e8s possible voire tr\u00e8s probable que vous ayez enfin r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 d\u00e9passer le niveau 20, le monde semble \u00e0 votre port\u00e9e et pourtant vous vous faites bloquer au milieu d'un level par un \u00e9lite exceptionnellement fort accompagn\u00e9 du boss du niveau qui vous ach\u00e8vent en 5 coups malgr\u00e9 toutes vos pr\u00e9cautions. C'est extr\u00eamement rageant et c'est certainement la raison pour laquelle je n'ai que 70 heures.\n\n\nR\u00e9sum\u00e9 : \n\n+ grande diversit\u00e9 des classes\n+ chaque action compte ...\n+ ... et pour les autres il y a des raccourcis\n+ les choses \u00e0 d\u00e9bloquer\n+ le lore\n+ majoritairement gratuit (pas f2p ou p2w, hein j'ai bien dit gratuit)\n\n- un peu compliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 prendre en main au d\u00e9but\n- frustrant quand on perd au niveau 15 contre un \u00e9lite un peu craqu\u00e9 qu'on a pas vu venir...\n- totalement injuste (mais c'est aussi pour \u00e7a qu'on l'aime ^^)\n- les qu\u00eates\n\n+- vraiment difficile\n+- les succ\u00e8s ... (s\u00e9rieusement ? 1638 succ\u00e8s ?)\n\nConclusion\n\nEssayez-le, \u00e7a ne co\u00fbte rien.", "timestamp_created": 1497413977, "timestamp_updated": 1497413977, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5,

designed classes that said its not without its problems,\n\nPartially I take issue with the perma death mechanic. I tend to like games with permadeath as far as rougelike games go. Nethack is amazing a gritty survival game and every playthrough is unique and you feel fragile and human through out it. ToMEs playthroughs all start roughly the same and get better 10/15 levels in. Those first 10 levels are a slog after you have done it a couple of time. Pouring 10 hours into a character then getting a clumsy death when you are on you last life is pretty painful because you have to restart with the same plot, with the same dungeons, and often with the same unique item drops. It becomes uninviting. \n\nExploration mode you say then.. but that has no penalty taking away the tension completely. You need a middle mode between exploration and adventure, perhaps losing all your items (bar the three stocked in your box) for a continue? Or at least gaining a life after a major boss. If you pour 10,15,20 hours before dying its a huge time investment and its very punishing. Particularity because the early game is relatively dull. More choice and divergent paths in the early game might help. \n\nAfter a death you pretty much have to play with a different class (which are all brilliantly designed and play fluidly with so many build styles changing gameplay/strategy considerably) and it can take awhile to get to grips with how that class functions often this can result in silly deaths. Which is the bizarre thing that you have to play a class to have a good idea of how you want to build it, but due to the time commitment you would rather restart with a different class then master one.\n\nBasically if you have a lot of time to try the different classes and get good go for it! The amount of depth in the character builds is staggering with some really awesome stuff. (I love the time manipulation ones which you can really mess around with placements and divide and pool enemies together) but all of them offer valid play styles, from adaptable to min-maxing synergies. The depth of build is the real core strength of this game and trying a new class is what makes you play again after a bad beat. There are very little games with this much content and its a lot of value for money. \n\nPros:\n\nIntelligent strategic gameplay\n\nHuge choice of classes and viable builds within classes offering dozens of different play-styles\n\nChallenging game play and while your character improves to godly levels it remains challanging\n\nEnormous amount of content and most of it at a surprisingly high quality\n\nInteresting and engaging mechanics which meaningfully change the game with different classes.\n\nCons:\n\nSame starting areas get samey \n\nPunishing consecutive mistakes. 5 bad minutes can destroy a 15 hour playthrough\n\nWeak overwritten lore has potential but is wordy and unengaging with hard to believe motivations between groups\n\nSome bugs that need ironing out\n\nSome mechanics are poorly explained and pretty unclear.\n\nNot really a game that is forgiving to people with a job/relationship/other interests huge time sink with very little value outside of its mechanics \n\n\nWould I recommend? Absolutely. Very few games this good at this price range play a few times get some decent playthroughs going then put it down and maybe pick it up again later.", "timestamp_created": 1496890270, "timestamp_updated": 1497282701, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 55, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.820603", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32232185": {"recommendationid": "32232185", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040892359", "num_games_owned": 1889, "num_reviews": 98, "playtime_forever": 990, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510549326}, "language": "english", "review": "I have a lot of games... like wayyyy too many.

Never trust a positive review from a guy saying \"this is the best game ever\" but has only 5h playing it. So many games look great at first, only to be forgotten in a week or two.\n\nNow, take a look at some of the reviews for this game. There are people with over a 1,000 hours of ToME behind them. This says a lot about the game's depth, replayability and just sheer fun factor.\n\nI've been a fan of roguelikes for a long time now (maybe for over 15 years? who knows?), and this is hands down the best one I've ever played. The designer knew what to focus on instead of flooding the game with half-implemented features that end up taking away from the fun of the game. There is no hunger, consumables etc. Heck, even crafting was only added in a recent DLC, and even then it's only a small detail.\n\nSo what is there that it has? The best and most creative class-system ever seen in an RPG game, together with a great tactical combat system, with enemies potentially having access to the same skills as the player. I mean, in this game you can be a chronomancer and one of your skills called \"See the threads\" allow you to play the same X turns three times and then choose the best thread to make it \"reality\". Another class literally possesses mobs and uses their own powers. Every class is very unique and plays very differently. The unique items that can drop are also very cleverly designed, giving you unique and fun powers and not just being a pumped-up version of a normal item with the name in a different color.\n\nOther than that, the game is very hard, which can be frustrating for some, but there are many permadeath options for the less hardcore players out there. The lore is also very rich, even though lore is not really something I care about in these games.\n\nThe only downside I can think of are the graphics, which are just bad.

Basically what that means is it's turn-based, levels are procedurally generated, it's fairly challenging, and there is permadeath. (The last can be tweaked a bit in different modes but there are no save slots in any mode.)\n\nThe graphics are obviously not the Witcher 3, but are good enough, in a nice semi-realistic \"classic fantasy\" style. (I personlly don't like cartoony graphics like say Torchlight.)\n\nThe music is surprisingly good, some of it is available here if you're curious- https://www.jamendo.com/artist/2740/celestial-aeon-project?language=en\n\nThe gameplay is very deep. There are dozens of different classes, including rather exotic ones like \"Oozemancer\" and one that dual wields shields. Some of these are initially locked (one of the few questionable design decisions IMO), but that can be changed with a mod. There are the usual stats like INT and STR, plus a lot of different resistances and abilities. One nice thing is that bosses are generally not immune to things like stun and slow. Some games (Final Fantasy for example) have trash mobs that are too easy to bother using debuffs on, but then the bosses are immune, so a lot of the spells are pointless. Here you find yourself using all of your abilities fairly frequently.\n\nOne of the areas it really shines is in eliminating anything that is tedious. For example, most RPGs have consumables, and you can cheese things by stocking up on them, which requires grinding. Instead of consumables you have \"infusions\" that are basically swappable skills with cooldowns. This means you have to time your cooldowns well, and be humble enough to run away sometimes, instead of just buying a stack of potions. Another is you can automatically explore a zone. This doesn't make the game easier exactly, since these type of things aren't challenging, just boring. It is really good at streamlining things without dumbing them down.\n\nGiven that it's procedurally generated, the story is I would say above average but not amazing, although the writing is quite good and there is a lot of lore. Instead it focuses on replayability and different game modes. There are about 1,300 achievements, however many of these are duplicates based on the three different permadeath modes (permadeath one life, permadeath multiple lives and no permadeath) and difficulty levels. I think there are 9 combinations so 1,300 / 9 = ~140 achievements roughly. Still a decent number. And with so many classes you can definitely have a lot of different playthroughs.\n\nFor the price I wasn't expecting much, but was very pleasantly surprised. This is not one of those trendy, shallow gimmicky indie games that you play for a few hours then get bored.

I'm not a great player - I tend to get overconfident and get in way over my head.  But ToME is fun.\n\nSo what makes Tales of Maj'Eyal special?  Why do I keep going back to it year after year, giving it more of my time than almost every other game in my not insubstantial collection?  \n\nThere's a grand diversity in the characters you can play, and their play styles are very different.  You have multiple campaigns, as well as the recently improved Infinite Dungeon.  \n\nThe skill selection is great.  Lots of skills to choose from, each with multiple levels.  Races usually have their own skill progression tree, as well.  There are passive skills, sustained skills (that opponents can turn off sometimes), and active skills.  Each of the active skills has a cooldown.  Some items will give you access to active skills as well, or reduce a cooldown on a skill, or make a whole skill tree a little more effective.  \n\nAny active skill can be auto-triggered, if you like.  Most of the races have an instant skill to start off with that gives them some benefit, and you can just say \"Yeah, when someone closes in on me, fire off that skill\" and you don't have to worry about it anymore.  \n\nWhich brings us to auto-explore.  Like DCSS, ToME has a great auto-explore, so when you're not min-maxing your character or finding awesome artifacts, you're making meaningful decisions.  \n\nIn the end, those meaningful decisions almost always end in your demise.  As someone once said: \"Playing a roguelike is like being a kamikazi pilot: you start off knowing you're going to die.\"  Rare is the explorer who does not meet some untimely end.  And that too is part of the charm of roguelikes: it's so very often quickly over, but every so often you luck out and live longer than you have any right to.  And you feel like such a bad-ass.

It also really likes cooldown-based abilities, so at times you'll feel like you're doing MMO combat.\n\nI found the game too easy initially on Normal, starting the game as a Cornac Berserker regular enemies were no challenge at all, only bosses took some work to kill. The game also drops you in a forest which is quite boring to explore, and the graphics don't make very clear which tiles are traversable and which are not. I recommend using the auto-explore function ('Z' key, rebindable) in levels where you're mostly meeting trash mobs.\n\nWith time the game ups the challenge (and you can run into very dangerous areas if you're not careful, the game gives you a message which alludes to the difficulty when changing zones), and with level-ups you start discovering the deep RPG and item system. No complaints here, developing and equipping your character is very interesting, even though the game drowns you a in a sea of magic items with prefixes and suffixes, like Diablo and its ilk. (And unlike diablo, it has a lot of very small modifications to 10+ damage types. Yawning when you find yet another super-rare/legendary is never a good sign.) You unlock new characters and features through quests in the game, which I found cool.\n\nCombat is quite compelling whenever there's a sense of danger. As in most roguelikes, not getting surrounded and paying attention to everything before making a move is key. Between equipment, infusions/runes and skills, you have a lot of abilities with cooldowns, so most turns will be spent picking the right one or positioning yourself to use one rather than simply running into an enemy to auto-attack. What I was most impressed with is when facing boss-type characters, they use pretty much the same ability system as you, and they sometimes have a lot of skills. While it makes identifying a dangerous enemy at a glance pretty hard, it does make for rather epic fights as they cast spells, heal and trigger cooldown abilities just like you. Trust me, the first time you meet an enemy with knockback and spells is really scary when playing a melee character.\n\nThe interface, however, is [b]REALLY AWFUL[/b] (despite ridiculous frontpage claims of \"modern graphical and customisable interface, intuitive mouse control\"), especially the inventory. It's not really comfortable to use with the mouse: instead of displaying a tooltip for what you're hovering your cursor over, it insists on always having some object selected, obscuring your view with the information display. Movement with the mouse is also not very intuitive, as your character will move to where you point... until it finds something \"interesting\" or an enemy, and then you have to revert to moving a square at a time if you want any semblance of control.[b] It would actually seem like a good idea to learn the game solely with the keyboard at first, maybe even play another, keyboard only roguelike before this one. Only then will the mouse control layer make full sense.[/b] There's also a problem of information overload when looking at map tiles (and other stuff): do I really need to know that I need a \"special breathing method\" to traverse walls everytime I'm looking at one? The game cruelly needs to display only crucial information at a glance, and then offer to say, press shift to show detailed info like now in the tooltip (see Civilization IV and V and its most complex mods for good examples).\n\nThe game has a fixed overworld, story elements and quite a bit of lore, which set it apart from NetHack and Crawl which only offer a giant dungeon. I found this refreshing, but I it comes with suggested level indications for dungeons and minimum levels to use some items, very jarring and immersion-breaking compared to the natural increase in difficulty as you go down in levels in other titles. It's gonna have a massive impact on replayability, too, the world map feels pretty small. There are towns and shops to return to and sell your loot: I think I slightly prefer the approach of Crawl where you can't sell stuff or transfer it to other characters, so you just dump stuff you don't need without hesitation. But if you like sorting through tons of loot Diablo or Borderlands-style, you'll be happy with this game.\n\nThere's no downside to resting ('R' key) in this game. In fact I recommend resting as soon as you finish beating a group of enemies, to recharge your health and stamina and bring all your abilities off cooldown. (Annoyingly, some charge bars like \"equilibrium\" which is need for some powers are ignore by the rest function, leading you to spam the skip turn button or use a mod if you want to get back into an optimal state.) Having to spam rest like this doesn't feel too great, it feels like the game had a hunger mechanic like other roguelikes to urge you on and prevent abusing rest, but dropped it along the way leaving Rest feeling orphaned.\n\nThere are a few other weird leftovers in the game, like a \"Scrying Orb\" which auto-identifies objects... and is completely pointless since objects always auto-identify in this game. Somehow the author hacked that in with a magical item at some point and left it as-is. Also, most annoyingly the game drowns you in loot but unlike, say, Crawl, anything you leave on the floor will disappear after a while. EXCEPT in \"vaults\", small enclosed areas with treasure guarded by monsters. Good luck identifying what was a vault when coming back to an area you've cleared, though, there are no indications except the room shape. This is an annoying non-feature you'll feel compelled to use, if only to stash stuff until you find the player home (which is also the in-game location of your te4.org, microtransaction-fueled online item Vault), or to make sets of element-resistant armor for various situations.\n\nOverall I quite like the game, but it has a lot of room for improvements in the UI and graphics clarity department. Some of the gameplay choices made that set it apart from other roguelikes give a different, but not necessarily better experience. And as mentioned there are small but nasty oversights in the game design, which ends up feeling like a work in progress based on other roguelikes rather than its own thought-out entity. The community also seems to be blind to most of these flaws, and over-protective of any choice the author makes.\n\nTry it out to experience the sheer amount of content a true roguelike can offer, but do expect a flawed gem. It might be the best game in the Angband family of roguelikes, having gotten rid of annoying stuff like non-persistent levels while still offering mechanics pretty unique to the family like multiplying creatures.\n\n[i]You can go to my Steam profile for more info on classical Roguelikes and suggestion of both free and paid ones.[/i]", "timestamp_created": 1491284233, "timestamp_updated": 1493177256, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.558365", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30911476": {"recommendationid": "30911476", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003604900", "num_games_owned": 135, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 37118, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512718614}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0412\u043e\u0442 \u0447\u0442\u043e-\u0447\u0442\u043e, \u0430 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0432 \u044d\u0442\u0443 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443 \u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0434\u043e\u043b\u0433\u043e \u0438 \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0440\u0430\u0437. \u0417\u0430\u0448\u043a\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0432\u0430\u044e\u0449\u0438\u0435 \u043a\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439, \u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u0438\u0435 \u0432\u0435\u0442\u043e\u043a \u0440\u0430\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0447\u043a\u0438, \u043a\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0441\u043e\u0432 \u0437\u0430 \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0438 \u0443\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0435\u0439 \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438, \u043d\u0430 \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0445 \u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0439\u0442\u0438 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443. \u042d\u0442\u0430 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0443\u0431\u044a\u0435\u0442 \u0442\u0443\u0447\u0443 \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438, \u0435\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u0437\u0430\u0441\u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0437\u0430 \u043d\u0435\u0435 \u043a\u0430\u043a \u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0443\u0435\u0442", "timestamp_created": 1491171695, "timestamp_updated": 1491171695, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.533599", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30880447": {"recommendationid": "30880447", "author": {"steamid": "76561198092095123", "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 2581, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494697006}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u795e\u4f5c\uff01\uff01\uff01\nTOME4\nTOME4\nTOME4\nTOME4\nTOME4\n\u7b49\u5f85\u6c49\u5316\u66f4\u65b0\n\n\u4e0d\u77e5\u662f\u4e0d\u662f\u6211\u7535\u8111\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u52a0\u8f7d\u8bfb\u6761\u65f6\u754c\u9762\u603b\u662f\u4e00\u95ea\u4e00\u95ea\u7684\n\n\u53e6\u5916\u611f\u89c9\u6210\u5c31\u8fd8\u662f\u592a\u5c11\u4e86\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6362\u7740\u82b1\u6837\u5728\u52a0\u4e00\u4e9b", "timestamp_created": 1491064083, "timestamp_updated": 1491064083, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497512", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30857301": {"recommendationid": "30857301", "author": {"steamid": "76561198133251638", "num_games_owned": 279, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 6971, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493132780}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game.

It's one of those games that you'll die a lot in, but each time you'll learn something new and think \"Alright, one more playthrough, I've got this figured out now\". Later, you realize that you've been playing for the past 12 hours, your eyes hurt, and you still have a lot more learning to do. \n\nToME can be kind of intimidating at first glance. There's a million different spells, skills, and traits that you can pick through, and it's up to you to learn which ones to use and when. I suggest starting simple, find a skill or two to use that kills stuff, and slowly try to branch out from there so you don't get overwhelmed and quit. If you give this game a chance, you'll more than likely fall in love with it.\n\nThere's a variety of different classes, many of which require you to complete a certain quest or objective with a starter class before they are unlocked. The game's difficulty scales fairly well, you're (probably) not going to die immediately upon starting a new campaign, and the first few quest chains aren't too difficult, which provides new players with some time to learn the basic mechanics of the game. In order to truly succeed in the game, however, significant attention will need to be put into resistances and learning which enemies do what kind of damage. Preparation and strategy are required, sprinting into battles is a good way to die, trust me, I know.\n\nThe game is difficult, so be prepared. I have nearly 100 hours into the game and - sadly - still have not beaten the campaign. Despite this, I highly recommend the game. It's rewarding, fun, and has high replayability (look at the hours played of 95% of the reviewers). Do yourself a favor and buy ToME.\n\nOne last thing, this game goes on sale a LOT. Typically for 50-75% off. If you still run a paper route and $6.99 is too steep for your blood, wait for one of these sales and say \"Goodbye\" to your free time.", "timestamp_created": 1490503643, "timestamp_updated": 1490503643, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528433", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30733865": {"recommendationid": "30733865", "author": {"steamid": "76561197963643929", "num_games_owned": 1086, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 19999, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 178, "last_played": 1514304939}, "language": "english", "review": "I have been playing ToME for a while now, and I am still enjoying it.\nThe game is turn based roguelike about creating a character from a race/class combination, and slowly growing stronger by killing monsters and finding random items while trying to not die.\nThe world, the general theme of the dungeons and the main quests are always the same, but each dungeon floor is unique for the playthrough.\nThe game is not always fair, but at some level I really enjoy randomly ending up in bad situations, like what to do when you're all of a sudden being cut off from the stairs to the previous level, poisoned, low on hp, and surrounded by monsters; with practise and a bit of thought and soime luck a lot of bad situations are possible to come out of alive, and I find it hugely rewarding when I manage to pull off an unlikely escape to come back and clean up after recovering.\n\nThe game contains a large number of secrets that allow more character creation options when they are discovered, which I feel adds a lot of depth to the game; I'm still trying to find them all.\n\nLeveling up allows some skill points to be allocated to any group of skills you know (Some groups may be added to the basic set of skilkls from your race / class combination), and stat points to be distributed among a fairly standardized set of stats. I feel that it is a bit unfortunate that the skills typically scale off a particular stat, for example berserkers have skills that scale off of strength and vitality, so investing in other stats is hard to justify.\n\nThe game is still under active development, and patches to address balance issues or add content or fix bugs are released regularly.\nThis can be a bit of a mixed blessing, as sometimes monsters that used to be easy yesterday all of a sudden can get you killed because they were buffed in a patch.\n\nThe game seems to have some minor annoying bugs that still haven't been fixexd, and a few major ones seem to bite people occationally. As of the latest patch the game seems to have trouble saving when playing online at times, but I am sure this will be fixed soon. As I understand it the entire game was created by a single developer, and given how many things there are that interact I think that he has done a very good job.\n\nThe graphics could be prettier, and the engine could probably be optimized a lot, but if you can stand dying a lot in the beginning while learning how everything works the game is really fun and rewarding with a high skill ceiling for players who enjoy exploring and creating powerful characters who survive against all odds, and if you haven't picked up this (slightly unpolished) gem already I strongly suggest you do.", "timestamp_created": 1490467911, "timestamp_updated": 1490467911, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505095", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30728891": {"recommendationid": "30728891", "author": {"steamid": "76561198138636824", "num_games_owned": 53, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 3535, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512721968}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u771fTM\u7684\u795e\u4f5c\u554a\uff0c\u6211\u7adf\u7136\u73b0\u5728\u624d\u77e5\u9053\u3001\u3001\u3001", "timestamp_created": 1490453758, "timestamp_updated": 1490453758, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30719074": {"recommendationid": "30719074", "author": {"steamid": "76561198172954998", "num_games_owned": 69, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1418, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1424478658}, "language": "english", "review": "Speechless.....", "timestamp_created": 1490418325, "timestamp_updated": 1490418325, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30681892": {"recommendationid": "30681892", "author": {"steamid": "76561198315183346", "num_games_owned": 327, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 7346, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512803520}, "language": "english", "review": "Is it hard?

(Ie / only a few nights ago the dev set out a bunch of random events including but not limited to handing out gold to turning you into a bunny with 20% crit chance.)\n+Lore is pretty damn Interesting\n+Its literally pennies for how much gameplay you can actually get.\n+Achievements! Achievements 1000+ Achievements for all you achievement junkies :P\n+Classes are and usually split into two obvious builds, sometimes more for the more.. creative players, and require some planning thought, example being a Spell sword, who focuses on casting and uses melee as an alt or who uses sword play and only uses magic to bolster his sword swings / damage.\n+Seems to be a lot of very varied items and gear all of which, especially items bearing prefixes and affixes can be incredibly useful and generally all can compliment some type fo character build\n\nCons - Theres actually very few cons other than the few below, BUT the game is Niche, this won't fulfil every RPG \"roguelike\" fan.\n-Graphics are litlle basic (May or may not put people off, personally doesn't bother me as the game is far too good to sit and complain about how it looks too)\n-Have experienced a few lock ups on tabbing out during load screens (probably a dumb thing to do but Youtube ads don't skip themselves...)\n-Utterly Unreal amount of achievements may actually cause people to slog through the game not enjoying it.\n-RNG can really screw you over.\n-Game is incedibly difficult (for those who would rather face roll than think and believe they are the ultimate warrior/gamer)\n-Enemies can be very, very unfair if you get unlucky, which can be disheartening in rogue like perma death difficulty as there can be situations where your character may as well just drop his weapon and bend over.", "timestamp_created": 1490168582, "timestamp_updated": 1490169318, "voted_up": true,

It's a proper turn-based, grid-based tactical game with perma-death (although you can play it without it if you're a puss :D). \n\nSet in the fantasy world of Eyal, a land which is filled with deep lore and interesting stories and characters. The number of races and classes available is huge and the varying combinations of these make the game immensely replayable.. And you'll want to replay it because it's incredibly addictive but also very difficult. (you will die. A lot) The difficulty (something which should be expected from any true roguelike) is not unfair however, and there is always a way in which you could have gotten out of the situation which killed you, you just might not know it untill a few playthroughs later. The more you play TOME, the more options for skills and gear and combinations of these you become aware of and this, in turn will increase your chances of surviving a little bit longer.\n\nThe game has a huge number of things to unlock by carrying out various actions in the game world, from new races and classes, birth options which affect every character you make thereafter and new skill trees for existing classes. Again, if you have ANY kind of interest in roguelikes (not for everyone for sure) then you owe it to yourself to pick up TOME and spend a few hours learning the basics.

It has a great tutorial that explains the fairly complex gameplay well, and has tooltips for practically everything, and just a great interface all around. Frankly it has one of the best interfaces I've seen in any game. It also has a built in chat in-game which is helpful so you can ask questions without having to go to the forums. Players ask questions and share item finds through a link system but the game also automatically posts a global message whenever someone dies or reaches one of the main quest goals. It's a nice touch that lets you feel like you're part of a community as you play alone (this is SP only). It's very active too - this game has really grown in popularity since its Steam release.\n\nIt's hard to explain why Tome4 is so fun, but it's a combination of really satisfying turn based combat, \"loot drop\", and an enormous variety of monsters to slay, weapons to find, and classes, skills and spells to choose from. Combine that with permadeath (though the \"standard\" mode gives you about 7 lives over 50 levels spread out, even with that though you're unlikely to make it out of even the beginning dungeons your first few outings) which I think makes any gaming experience much more edge-of-your seat and it's just one of the best games I've ever played. \n\nThe class design is really one of the high points though. \"Solipsists\" that can invade an enemy's dreams and attack their mind directly (basically it throws you into a battle in said enemy's subconscious), chronomancers that can manipulate the flow of time (among other things you can split a time thread and then choose what result you want after playing each thread separately), shadow blades that can phase through walls and animate their own shadows to do their killing for them. A lot of very creative stuff. At time of this review there are 32 classes in the default, un-modded game. Yes, you read that right.\n\nThere's also a total absence of grinding and potion hoarding and the atmosphere is well done with lots of interesting, well written lore tidbits lying around that you can find. If you enjoy tactical turn based games or RPGs, or just something that's really difficult it's definitely worth at least checking out.\n\nWorth mentioning too that the one man dev team is a fanatic who releases game updates constantly. The community as a whole is probably one the nicest and most helpful I've seen.\n", "timestamp_created": 1489312557, "timestamp_updated": 1489312557, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30463720": {"recommendationid": "30463720", "author": {"steamid": "76561198082520473", "num_games_owned": 126, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1955, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500055384}, "language": "schinese", "review": "rougelike\u5165\u5751\u4f5c", "timestamp_created": 1489299852, "timestamp_updated": 1489299852, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30463126": {"recommendationid": "30463126", "author": {"steamid": "76561197982718562", "num_games_owned": 307, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1271, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489332439}, "language": "english", "review": "If you're into this kind of game, trust me when I say its everything and more.

Different zones, uniques or orange loot, events and side quests with every character!\n- Great character customization! 10 races, >20 classes, each with several talent paths to choose. Even more with DLC\n- Full of lore! Every zone, item, and boss has a story behind it.\n- Loads of information is available to you. Can look up enemies skills, saves, resistances, etc. Nothing is hidden!\n- Great mod support! Make your own race or class, with blackjack! And hookers!\n\nCons:\n-Some classes are little weaker compared to others, especially the starting classes.\n-Game engine kinda bogs down when zones get really crowded , or while saving\n-Rare mobs basically roll different class skillsets, so some rares can be quite insane with certain unlucky combinations\n-A playthrough can be as long as a full DnD campaign.\n-RNG is a cruel mistress sometimes \n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1488262486, "timestamp_updated": 1488262486, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 47, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.787904", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30199798": {"recommendationid": "30199798", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058911806", "num_games_owned": 25, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 6606, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492279548}, "language": "english", "review": "9/10\nOne of the best games of it's kind.

Although many people dislike hardcore rogue-like games, Tales of Maj'Eyal will satisfy even the most casual player. Here are some pros and cons of the game:\n\nPros:\n1- One can disable or tweek perma-death option. Ideal for casual players.\n2- There are endless possibilities for character creation. A big variety of races and a even bigger variety of classes.\n3- You can unlock new races and classes as you play the game and complete certain tasks a certain way, opening up the possibility to run more than one playthrough (considering you play casually *coughs*).\n4- Really well done skills and skill tree learning system.\n5- Trasmogrification Chests are the BEST THING EVER. It's basically a chest the player carries that allows him to pick up all and any item in a level, disconsidering his/hers emcumbrance. After you complete a level, you can choose which items you want to stay with and easily sell the rest instantly.\n6- There are lots of ways to reach the end of the main storyline, and I gotta say, what a storyline.....\n7- Players can dig through most walls if they have a pickaxe.... that's awesome and adds to what makes this game so different.\n8- The world treats you differently depending on your race, class, past deeds and more.\n9- Ability to re-spec most talents and skills.\n10- I'll add a pro to the amount of different magical channeling power the game has. a.k.a. Mana, Stamina, Vim, Psi, Equilibrium, and more. It adds variety and explicitly shows the player that no magic type is the same.\n11- The player can learn some skills they would never possibly have by equipping certain items.\n12- The ability to stroll through easy levels.\n13- Inscriptions and runes are freaking nice. I have never seen a rogue-like game doing that sort of system before.\n14- The dungeon balancing system is gold.\n\nCons:\n1- I know it's a rogue-like game, but it's not meant to be completed without dying at least once, no matter how strong you are. You will either have a stupid death, or a big monster will exploit your weakness and insta-kill you (props to High Peak) (more info below the cons)\n2- Certain classes are heavily unbalanced compared to others. Example: Play as a Doombringer, and then switch to an Alchemist. You'll feel the difference.\n3- Dungeon balancing system not working for High Peak. If there was ONE PLACE in which this system SHOULD have worked.... it just didn't budge.\n\nSit down guys, it's story time.\n\nFirst character I made, was an elf archer. Nothing special. He died after I got ambushed by a hand saw guy. GOLD.\n\nThe second character I made (with permadeath off *coughs*) was the most ignorant guy I could've ever created. A Higher Doombringer. I would simply run through hordes of enemies without a problem, no biggy. That's the character I used to learn about the game, the story and to explore Maj'Eyal and the Far East.\nThe best/worst experience I can tell you guys, was basically as I entered High Peak (last level of the game). I quickly noticed mobs 17 levels above mine. \"Wtf is that supposed to mean?\". Luckily my character was just an ignorant prick, so I started \"playing\" the game. As I cleared areas and moved to other areas of High Peak, I noticed the level difference between me and the mobs was getting bigger and bigger. \"Now that's a problem\". Plus, all the mobs there seem to confuse you, blind you, time warp you, pin you down, slow you down, silence you, and... the worse in my case... disarm you, every... freaking... turn. \"Wtf am I supposed to do?? I can't even calculate how many turns I'll have until I can cast certain skill, because I'm slow and being time warped\". I felt like playing the game inside a vortex while high on heroine, because.. oh man... all of the status effects actually play a visual role on your screen (which is a pro). I wish I could tell you about my final boss experience, but that's way too much for now. \n\nEven though it was serious BS, I give my High Peak experience a 10/10. That's simply a rogue-like game for ya.\n", "timestamp_created": 1487855618, "timestamp_updated": 1487855618, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 29, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.722619", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30109625": {"recommendationid": "30109625", "author": {"steamid": "76561198090262862", "num_games_owned": 161, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3799, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511391218}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is great. 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1487808941, "timestamp_updated": 1487808941, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30097358": {"recommendationid": "30097358", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972217646", "num_games_owned": 298, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 7130, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512747502}, "language": "english", "review": "Better than butter", "timestamp_created": 1487762898, "timestamp_updated": 1487762898, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30054407": {"recommendationid": "30054407", "author": {"steamid": "76561198082633270", "num_games_owned": 640, "num_reviews": 61, "playtime_forever": 5066, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512792358}, "language": "schinese", "review": "52\u4f60\u652f\u6301\u4e86\u4e0d\u5403\u4e8f\uff0c52\u4f60\u652f\u6301\u4e86\u4e0d\u4e0a\u5f53\nROGUELIKE\u7c89\u4e1d\u5fc5\u5907\u4e4b\u4f5c\u3002\n\n\n\u5f88\u60f3\u77e5\u9053\u6211\u73a9\u8fd9\u4e2a\u80fd\u73a9\u591a\u4e45\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\u5206\u5272\u7ebf-----------------------------------------------------\n\n2017/3/3\u8865\u5145\n\n\u73a9\u4e8630\u591a\u4e2a\u5c0f\u65f6\uff0c\u611f\u89c9\u5df2\u7ecf\u5165\u5751\u3002\u4e00\u5f00\u59cb\u5efa\u8bae\u5148\u6b7b\u5341\u51e0\u6b21\uff0c\u719f\u6089\u4e00\u4e0b\u6e38\u620f\u3002\u7136\u540e\u4e0a\u8d34\u5427\uff0c\u770b\u4e00\u4e2a\u666e\u4eba\u72c2\u6218\u58eb\u7684\u6559\u5b66\u8d34\u3002\u8fd9\u6837\u4e0b\u6765\uff0c\u5c31\u5dee\u4e0d\u591a\u6210\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u6b63\u5e38\u7684\u83dc\u9e1f\u4e86\u3002\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\u5206\u5272\u7ebf-----------------------------------------------------\n\n2017/6/1\u7eaa\u5ff5\u6027\u8865\u5145\n\n\u5728\u7ecf\u8fc7\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e0b\u5348\u7684\u594b\u6218\u540e\uff0c\u4eba\u751f\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b21\u901a\u5173\uff08\u666e\u901a\u96be\u5ea6\uff09\uff0c\u6b64\u65f6\u5171\u6e38\u620f79.9h\n\u6700\u540e10\u5c42\u5f88\u8003\u9a8c\u8010\u5fc3\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u4f60\u5f88\u60f3\u901a\u5173\u7684\u65f6\u5019\u3002\n\u53ef\u60dc\u6700\u540e\u4e3b\u89d2\u8fd8\u662f\u5b51\u7136\u4e00\u8eab\u2026\u2026\u6709\u70b9\u53ef\u60dc", "timestamp_created": 1487585613, "timestamp_updated": 1496309801, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.593810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30052800": {"recommendationid": "30052800", "author": {"steamid": "76561198127258047", "num_games_owned": 301, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 9936, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486261322}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best pure roguelike games out there.

I almost passed this game by but the 1620 achievements caught my eye. 1620 achievements for a 2.00 game? Admittedly, it was the achievements that made me purchase the game, what the heck, 2.00, if i dont like this game, no harm done, right? I love collecting achievements, although I am not good at it! So, there I was creating my character, giving them a name and choosing a player tile. I entered the world of Maj'eyal a lvl 1 archer. I died as a lvl 1 archer. Game Over. My character had disappeared. There was no, try again. No respawn. Nope. Game Over. My first lesson on what Roguelike means. ;) \n\nThere is different lvls of difficulty though, you do not have to play it as roguelike until you get to know the game really well. Exploration mode allows you to play with infiinite lifes, Adventure with limited lifes. \n\nI am probably the worst player at this game, I am still learning the game 30 hours in, and admittedly the highest lvl I have made it to is lvl 16 on normal mode. I have lost track of how many times i have died and had to start over - but that is the testimony to the game. I keep coming back to try again.........and again.......and again.

"playtime_forever": 64430, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 5492, "last_played": 1514352094}, "language": "english", "review": "First of all, let's get it out of the way: Tales of Maj'Eyal is a roguelike (in the traditional sense). That genre is notoriously difficult to approach due to its depth, random elements, and permadeath. However, ToME is much more approachable than its brethren. \n\nIn terms of Permadeath, there are three options that you, the player, may select when creating your character: Exploration (you have infinite lives, and you can still unlock races/classes/other) , Adventure (you have finite/limited lives. By progressing, you earn more lives.), and Roguelike (you are the character, death is final... though, there are means of cheating death that you may discover).   \n\nIn terms of random elements,  you will rarely straight up lose/win because of your luck (though it definitely seems that way at the start). Within ToME, randomness can affect your loot, the difficulty of champion monsters (enhanced versions of a regular monster), enemy placement within a dungeon, and types of obstacles (i.e. dungeon variations, random events, etc.). Despite all of that, ToME gives you a few powerful tools to compensate.  \n[olist]\n    [*] The ability to inspect ANY unit that you can see, as a free action. This allows you to see what abilities an enemy has, their stats, defenses, and much more. This means that if some enemy is new to you, or a champion variant is using some strange new ability, you can inspect it and adapt accordingly.\n    [*] Dungeon Consistency. Certain dungeons in the game will always be present in any playthrough. They will always fall within the same power level, and (almost) always have the same type of enemies. So, if you know you are approaching a certain area that is hypothetically filled with insane amounts of electric damage, you will be able to plan accordingly. The other aspect of this is that certain character excel in different dungeons, and are terrible in others. As you become more familiar with the game, you learn to play around your characters strengths/weaknesses, which leads me to the next point...\n    [*] The ability to RUN and ESCAPE. Some encounters are straight up unfair/impossible. Perhaps you got surrounded by a buch of weak enemies and are being stunned repeatedly. Or, you are stuck in a corner with a big, spooky minotaur. Unless you are tanky as all hell, and can heal for days, it is actually perfectly acceptable to just run/teleport to safety.\n[/olist]\n\n\nIn terms of depth, or wealth of mechanics, ToME is easily one of the best (if not the best). While other roguelikes may give you a bunch of ways to interact with a single item or the environment. ToME's depth comes from: \n\n[list]\n    [*] Vast amount of start options (race/class). It is impossible to emphasize how DIFFERENTLY some of the classes play from one another. You do not just unlock new classes and races, but new racial groups and types of classes outside of just the  typical warrior, rogue, wizard archetypes.\n    [*] Unique Items (items can have class abilities attached to them, or even unique abilities).\n    [*] The lore (if you care about that sorta thing).\n    [*] Environments/dungeons. Past a certain point in the game, you feel like you are starting a whole different game (for the main campaign). It definitely caught me off-guard.\n    [*] Boss encounters. With minimal spoilers, you definitely want to inspect some of these guys/gals/things.\n[/list]\n\n\nHonestly, this is easily my favorite game in my library.

I'm not particularly a fan of the Rogue-like genre, because I don't like the idea of progression loss. YET, I only like to play this game in the Adventure mode - the standard mode that the game was made to be played with limited lives (I eventually gonna try Rogue-like mode, with just 1 life). If you don't like this, you can play in exploration mode, that gives you infinite lives.\nTales of Maj'Eyal has a very immersive gameplay, regardless of its simple graphics. The story is pretty good and interesting, but what shines is the well composed challenging elements. It's different from riddles or gimmicks that other games put you through. The situations that ToME put you are complex, composed by various elements, that you need to judge and measure to take decisions. THIS. You FEEL the situation, you feel the DANGER. And you must to analyse and find a solution that can be simple or complex, still there is not only one solution, it is circumstantial. Sometimes you can't see solutions to a challenge but you progressively learn how to deal with it. One of the best feeling that the game gives you is the discovery of a solution to a apparently impossible situation.\nYes, the challenges are complex. But, the game gives you various options. Whereas you learn the dangers that you can face, you learn how to counter it. And, for this, you have a vast character building system, with numerous races and classes that you can combo and choose between vastly different playstyles. Each class and race have different ways to deal with situations, some classes and races are best to deal with some types of dangers, some have flaws that you must find a way to cover. And to deal with that, you have Trinkets, items and equipments - that gives you habilities to use -, you can loot or buy them in shop - you must choose wisely what you want to keep with you.\nThe exploration element of this game is good, there's tons of secrets to discovery and unlockables enable, like races, classes, and skill trees options to make your characters. The game has around 1500 achievments to unlock, if you are a achievment hunter.\nThe storyline is very good and interesting too, but beyond the main storyline, you have a deep and complex universe, which you unfold gradually in various logs and pieces of story that you must find in dialogue options, logs, places, doing secret quests and getting achievments.\nThe one-guy dev team is active and keeping the game alive, with online support, events, random blesses of the DarkGod, updates and expasions. The game is still alive. Even though you can play the game for free, it's definitely a game worth supporting. You can donate directly or buy the Steam version, those gives you donator privillege.

Fair but brutal. Easy to pick up, but can also plot, plan, conive, and strategize to the end of days. Loads of start options (classes, races, that sort) to unlock, with a decent assortment of default-unlocked characters ranging through easy-hard and beginner-complex spectrums. Graphics, sound, music all functional enough to work nicely, backed by gameplay that would've still dwarfed them anyhow if it would've had a big studio throwing insane money at artists to pretty it up. Completely turn-based, so you can jump up to answer the phone or door or grab a snack or whatever else (like just trying to think your way out of a rough patch when it looks like next move could be the last) without needing to find a pause, but you'll likely find yourself already up later than intended claiming to yourself that you'll go to bed after just one more level. Replayability already high when played on regular difficulty and some extra lives allowed, then you can always turn up difficulty while playing one-life mode and playing a class you're less comfortable with to make it more interesting, while also hunting down large amounts of achievements, some of which are challenging all on their own, others are challenging except in the rare case that the RNG components smile on you. Or start a character with difficulty turned down and/or lives set to infinite just to get a better idea of what will and won't work out later before doing it on a \"real\" savefile. And then you could always get into using or making mods if you're into that. Have spotty internet sometimes? As long as you had it already downloaded, completely works in offline mode (with minor limitations of not getting special event dungeons unlocked if the dev sprinkles it to everybody, and offline mode has a separate shared stash from online mode).\n\nStill not sure? Poke around their website, there should still be a free version available (had some minor limitations when I did so years ago, looks like less limits now?). Worth every penny to buy though.

Fans of the genre need this in their inventory. It's very cheap and the expansion content isn't as necessary as other games so just grab the base game if price is a factor. This game could easily be priced at 3-4 times the amount that it's priced at and it would still be worth it based on the quality and the extreme amount of content that it has.\n\nPros:\n1. The combat is insanely deep. While it is difficult for the inexperienced player even on normal level difficulty, it is always very fair. \n2. The amount of classes (and race combinations) in the game is ludicrous. They aren't like DCSS in which classes just dictate starting levels and items. Each class has skill trees to choose abilities from that have a huge impact on the way the character is played. \n3. There are several unique and rewarding mechanics, but I won't spoil them.\n4. Unlockables: Starting out with only a few options and then unlocking different races and classes feels very rewarding.  \n5. You find lore on the ground and can read it to get the storyline of each dungeon and the Maj'Eyal itself. I don't read it personally but the ones I have read are well written and thought out.\n6. It has an actual soundtrack, attack, spell, and ability sounds that are all high quality.\n7. Mods: Classes, improved resting, exploring, etc. \n\nCons:\n1. Some people consider the game easy. That being said, the game comes with multiple difficulties that increase to an almost unbeatable level. Playing on the hardest is nothing like playing on normal.\n2. Lives: not so much a con, but you can choose to play the game on or off roguelike. You can't unlock achievements or unlockables with unlimited lives, and you can't unlock roguelike level achievements with limited lives. \n3.

This is offset, of course, by the fact that it's about as forgiving and accessible as a brick wall. With spikes on it. And it's somehow firing a steam gun at you.\nThis is a game that almost kneecaps itself at every turn, in my opinion, only just barely getting good quality out of an idea that could have easily left this game yet another greyed out title on my library.\n\nIt's a massive game, sporting over a thousand bloody achievements, but you'll be suffering from roughly twelve types of PTSD by the time you get through the first batch of dungeons and actually start the story.\nThere's a massive amount of variety between god knows how many classes that are available, but they'll all probably die the same way.\nThere's a never ending slew of new sights to see and enemies to fight, but every one of them will probably either lead you to or be followed by a gruesome death.\n\nThis all being because, as the game so proudly states, it's a roguelike. And as a roguelike it's just about the worst made game I've ever played. Don't take that the wrong way, the game is great, but it's roguelike elements sell it short in places. To justify this, before I am impaled by a billion pitch forks, I'll remind you of FTL, faster than light. By all accounts, a great game. But FTLs biggest shortcoming was its final boss, which required near perfect planning and exceptional luck to beat, and when you lost, as it was whenever you lost, you were sent back to the start of this fairly long game.\n\nFTLs permanent death did no poor job of making you value your ship, and the game was just short enough to make it tolerable. This mentality has been taken in TOME and turned up to seven billion. You could complete a run of FTL in the time it takes you to get through the first batch of dungeons in this game, and the threat of losing it all doesn't get any smaller as you go on.\n\nWell, that's not entirely true. The default difficulty for TOME gives you a handful of lives to play around with, you can of course turn it up to true roguelike, but I'm fairly sure that was meant as a joke. However, the lives system does not take away from the fact that you, unless you're amazing at this game, are going to die from something out of your control at least once. And by \"at least\" I mean if you have the blood of a leprechaun in your veins and are blessed with uncanny luck. The rest of us are going to be suffering a lot more than that\n\nThat brings me neatly onto the most glaring turn off from this game. It's villain. You see, this villain, is not a character that you meet, nor is it a magical force, nor a force of nature. It is a concept, and it is always with you, breathing down your neck, plotting its next attack, ready to steal yet another life away from you without warning, nor mercy. \nThis villain, is the RNG.\n\nFor you will spend your time in this game preparing for when next the RNG will strike. You will hesitate as you assign level up points to consider \"Will this help me survive when the RNG strikes?\", you will creep around each and every corner, terrified that around it, the RNG will be lying in wait, ready to put all your talents on cooldown, poison you, and chop off half your health all in a single turn. The RNG is your worst, and only enemy, for the enemies that are not affected by it, you shall slaughter in the thousands, you will be prepared for each and every boss that you encounter, through hours of rigorous training, but you can never be fully ready for the minions of the RNG.\n\nIn all seriousness, I cannot remember the last time I died in this game to a boss that I fought poorly, or a talent that I used carelessly. I have, however, lost count of how many times I have died to elite wolves with steamguns, to gelatanious cubes with lightning magic, to the boss of the level spawning literally a square away from the level entrance. The game is difficult, but when the RNG bears its teeth in the worst possible way, there isn't much you can do except backpedal to the level entrance and go level some more in a different dungeon, and that's if the poison doesn't get you, because it is always poison.\n\nIn short, purchase this game, that's an order. But expect to be a different man/woman/other by the time you've completed it, mainly because your hair will have gone white and you may have aged a few years. It's not impossible, and I'm slowly learning the ways of this horrifyingly difficult world, but I expect to be doing so for a while.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1480170646, "timestamp_updated": 1480170646, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27665525": {"recommendationid": "27665525", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999616683", "num_games_owned": 467, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 21680, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509447925}, "language": "english", "review": "Currently this is my most played game on Steam, and for a good reason - the number of options for character building, equipment combinations and unlockables in ToME is enough to warrant hundreds upon hundreds of playthroughs. Granted, many of them are going to be short - this IS a roguelike, after all - but the game has enough to offer for both experienced veterans of the genre and explorers who are just in for the sights. ToME features a huge main campaign with a pre-determined world map and randomly placed quest dungeons, several dozens of class/race combos with unique skill trees and expansive battle mechanics to liven up the experience.\n\nUnlike many other modern roguelikes, ToME's one and only focus is combat. Even though there's an overworld and a bunch of peaceful cities, don't look at them as more than just trade hubs. What you're gonna do 99% of the time is look for a way out of yet another impossible situation that you recklessly rushed into, be it an unexpected boss or a group of trash mobs that you foolishly underestimated. Luckily, the player is always equipped with numerous tools to deal with trouble or escape to safety - there are runes, infusions, magic artifacts, proccing gear, abilities, status effects designed to keep you alive and your enemies either dead or, at least, a safe distance away. Learning how to use all of these is a different beast entirely, and you'll quickly find that even the normal difficulty playthrough might take you more than a hundred hours to master (even though the total time spent for an actual normal playthrough run without deaths might not exceed 10 hours in total). Once you've done it, higher difficulties unlock, and there's a good chance you also discovered some new classes/races to play along the way, so that your next game is completely different from the previous attempt.\n\n1.5k achievements (currently the record-holder on Steam), insane replayability, a quest progression to keep you motivated, and brutally difficult yet fair fights in the classic turn-based Rogue fashion - there really isn't much else to say.

I wasn't expecting much because of the low price point and odd graphics, but I've spent hundreds of hours in the game since I bought it (and all of that was before I installed my Steam copy).\n\nEvery character class has widely varied and interesting abilities, which makes them feel unique and fun. Warriors and rogues don't have quite as much to do as mages, but they aren't just \"easy mode\" like with some games, and the way their abilities behave makes the tactical battles as dramatic and fascinating as if they had magical powers.\n\nPractically every enemy has interesting abilities of its own, and even small ones can be dangerous if you aren't careful. The AI is simple, but effective. You can't just kite your way through fights. Small mistakes can escalate danger quickly, and death is rough (if you're playing on Adventure or Roguelike difficulties, at least), but when I die, it's usually my fault, and I can do better next time.\n\nLoot is plentiful, but easily managed, since you have an inventory item that stores new pick-ups, and sells off junk at the end of each area (at no loss, even). It takes a little while to figure out what items are good for your character, but once you know, inventory management is a breeze.\n\nThe story is mainly told through notes you pick up, and the lore is pretty deep and interesting. I'm there for the combat, though, so I'm glad subsequent playthroughs aren't bogged down by having to wait through dialogue and story scenes.\n\nThe game is very thoughtfully crafted, and I greatly appreciate the effort that was clearly put into it.

There are loads of things (classes, races, skills, cosmetic options etc.) to unlock simply by playing the game, loads of very different classes which al have different ways of playing. The game is difficult, but you can choose whether it's classic roguelike (permadeath), if you start with multiple lives, or if you can continue as often as you'd like. Additionally, you get a warning if you enter an area which is way too difficult or easy for your current level.

If you told me that this game was in Beta, I would have belived it. It's not the old-school graphics, it's the clunky User Interface. Menus cover up each other and several buttons don't work when you click them. The font is often too small to read, and some of the menus I still haven't figured out what their purpose is. Sometimes it feels like you are fighting the UI, more than the monsters of Maj'Eyal. \n\n I have yet to play a roguelike that I thought was fair, This one didn't really come close. I like the deep customization and unlockable classes and races. Where the game fails centers around it's claim of \"no grinding  required\". This is the game's downfall as you clear out an area and the monsters don't respawn. You move on to the next area only to find the monsters are too hard and kill you instantly. You are stuck and can't continue with the character becuase there are no ways to get stronger without a likely death. You have to start the game over or throw your body at monsters that are a lot stronger than your character. This is hardest on the classes that I think are really fun to play like rogues and mages. You are just not powerful enough to make it through the early areas and you can't grind to level up. The game doesn't compensate to allow classes that start off weak to be able to make it through the beginning of the game.

Spoiler warning, I'm gonna discuss the lore. If you still don't know what most of this review will be about, I have some bad news for you.\n\nSo TOME has a pretty lengthy backstory, somewhere around three to five pages per area and dozens of areas. It's a decent fiction novel when taken as a whole, well written at the very least. What makes me question it is the modern cultural and technological lens through which most of the factions are viewed. Virtually all races are modelled after some modern day oppressive government or terrorist organization. They're all busy to some degree with opressing or exterminating the other races, even outright destroying the world. And there's lots of stuff about aliens, weapons of mass destruction, virus outbreaks, mindcontrol gadgets.\nOn paper it's actually kind of awesome, yet the spectre of this interesting idea never quite materializes. Being a writer myself, I'm trying to find the right lesson to learn, the right advice to take away from all this.\n\nAbout halfway through the game you'll meet the orcs, a sort of Al Qaida style hyperviolent desert people. They're about to start another war and conquor the world, and you foil their plans and kill them right back into obscurity. Then it turns out they were part of some other scheme and it all comes down to... something?\nIn the expansion, the remaining orcs are spared and thrown into a ghetto. You play as an orc, break out of the ghetto, overthrow your oppressors and then confirm everyone's prejudice by being exactly as violent as everyone thinks you are. Huh. That almost went somewhere.\nMy conclusion is that it's an issue of theme and philosophy. Combining medieval fantasy and modernity is bound to have some interesting results, but it's also bound to clash. There's no obligation to pick sides or distill a moral truth, that's the job of a political essayist, not a writer. But you have to tie it together somehow. \nIn this regard I feel the everyman cypher protagonist is something of a missed oppertunity. Put someone unique there, an actual hero (or villain). It's incredibly stale to have the main character be unique among their species, the one hero who is different, but that's why writing isn't easy.\n\nAnyway the game is good, it's a roguelite, there's hordes of enemies, there's limited respawns, I'm sure some other review can explain it better.\n\n7/4 would project on the moon with a giant slideshow projector.", "timestamp_created": 1478024360, "timestamp_updated": 1478036556, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499433", "comment_count": "6", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26321291": {"recommendationid": "26321291", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014242604", "num_games_owned": 293, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3723, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 27, "last_played": 1513841385}, "language": "english", "review": "Tales of Maj'Eyal might be the single greatest and least known rogue RPG ever.

Didn't think any roguelike was capable of dethroning DCSS.  I'm still not convinced that ToME is better, but it's damn close.  Normally, the idea of quests in a roguelike immediately turns me off, but they're non-intrusive here, dialogue around quests with NPCs is minimal and in general the whole experience doesn't really feel repetative, and if you choose to read the text, it's suprisingly good actually.  Kinda cool collecting the various bits of lore that's scattered around dungeons.\n\nIf you're a junkie for stats, you'll find them in spades here.  I don't think I've ever played another dungeon crawler or roguelike with so much variety in all of the randomized items you'll find and different types of damage.  There are some extremely creative modifiers that I doubt you'd find in big budget crawlers like Diablo III, probably even rivals the depth of Path of Exile.\n\nThere's just an incredible amount of content here that's flawlessly executed.  Top notch developers who seem to eat/sleep/breathe this game with continued support and very friendly as well.  DarkGod freqents the in-game chat and don't be too surprised if he happens to use his godlike powers and transforms your character into a pirate or grant you other bizarre powers on a whim.\n\nIt takes a bit to learn all of the rules and details but it's totally worth it.

death is meaningfull, but never unwarrented and just the beginning of a new try to get even further.\n\nTOME lacks technicaly on first glance: yes animations are few, the 2D-design is rather minimalistic, but once you play a while you will see that it works, it \"fits\" all together. armor/weapons shows on your character \u00b4, skills have visual-representation and the world/npcs look in place.\n\nThe music in TOME is just amazing, beeing traveling the vast overworld map, diggin through an eerie dungeon or wandering to old woods; each track is rich in athmosphere and tone and i could listen to most of em even when not actualy playing the game. 10/10 here, easily one of the best soundtracks i`ve ever heard in one of these games.\n\nshort: you like rpgs, rogue-likes, turnbased-gameplay, rich chardevelopment and a world to get lost in -> must buy.", "timestamp_created": 1476441040, "timestamp_updated": 1476441040, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25979552": {"recommendationid": "25979552", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013651579", "num_games_owned": 302, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 5919, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509948603}, "language": "english", "review": "ToME is a thoroughly enjoyable old-school fantasy RPG with loads of races, classes, skills, items, and enemies, deep and interesting quests in a large world, and a variety of difficulty and permadeath options, all wrapped up in a graphical package with a decent UI.\n\nGreat things:\n\n- Story: lore abounds throughout the world\n- Breadth and depth of world: dozens of dungeons, some quite deep, on multiple continents, as well as towns, roaming NPCs, and plenty of areas that are unlocked by quests\n- Variety of monsters: there are rats and orcs, but so much more, as well - necromancers, fantastic magical creatures, hordes of wyrms... the list goes on\n- Variety of gear: multiple tiers with many levels of quality, tons of interesting egos, artifacts, and unusual things like lanterns and charms\n- Variety of maps and dungeons: every place feels different and has a different theme and story\n- Variety of graphical sprites: some dungeons look alike, but most places have a distinct look - also, plenty of weapon, armor, and character sprites to keep things interesting\n- High ratio of progression to tedium\n- Exploration mode gives you infinite lives, for those who like an easy game once in a while\n- 1,600+ achievements\n- Many UI and graphics configuration and customization options\n- Extremely good price for the amount of depth and replayability (less than one US cent per achievement, too)\n\nNot-so-great things:\n\n- Can feel very unbalanced at times (compared to other modern roguelikes): it's common to step into an enemy's line-of-sight and die instantly from a sudden powerful attack, even on normal difficulty\n- Default tiles are a bit painful on the eyes: I prefer the OldRPG tiles from the Steam Workship, which give the game a somewhat more Legend of Zelda-like look\n- In-game map is just colored blocks with no additional information\n- Automatic waypoint navigation is only available through add-ons, and the choices there are imperfect at best\n- High-DPI displays: if you zoom the UI, the hotbar is buggy unless the hotbar icon size is set to default (32 pixels)\n- Linux + NVIDIA: Some graphical flickering and slowness, especially with shader effects enabled", "timestamp_created": 1476178396, "timestamp_updated": 1476178527, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506620", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25828691": {"recommendationid": "25828691", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039121923", "num_games_owned": 767, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 7520, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513084685}, "language": "english", "review": "Probably the best intro to harcore rougelikes, because it has something so many others don't;

La possibilit\u00e9, par exemple, de d\u00e9sactiver la mort permanente (bien que ce soit blasph\u00e9matoire) permettront aux nouveaux joueurs de pouvoir s'adapter, de pouvoir d\u00e9couvrir le jeu, et de s'interesser au genre Rogue-like.\n\nLe jeu poss\u00e8de un nombre immense de possibilit\u00e9, que ce soit dans le choix des races, des classes, du choix des donjons, et en plus de g\u00e9n\u00e9rer proc\u00e9duralement les donjons.\n\nChaque experience de jeu peut \u00eatre similaire, voir totalement diff\u00e9rente, chaque choix fait pourra rapprocher le joueur de l'extase, chaque style de jeu peut trouver sa place dans ToME.\n\nPour resumer, ToME est le rogue-like ultime, accessible par tous (fan ou non) et poss\u00e8de de surcroit un mode \"Rpg\" avec un sc\u00e9nario tr\u00e8s appr\u00e9ciable.", "timestamp_created": 1473260753, "timestamp_updated": 1473260753, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507610", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25375942": {"recommendationid": "25375942", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002522103", "num_games_owned": 194, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 68940, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513068299}, "language": "english", "review": "Beat Insane, tried Madness...

Assuming you're familiar with roguelikes, ToME's main draw is its combat. Whereas games like Angband, Nethack and the like have a lot of focus on navigating the dungeons and managing your items, ToME sets itself apart from other RLs through its tactical approach to combat. \n\nIn ToME, every class is absolutely loaded with skills and abilities. Passive perks, active spells, buffs and the like. There's a class for everyone and a lot of fun to be had with them, and combined with the races you've got a lot of potential for characters. You could play a Berserker and cut people down through your bloodlust, an Alchemist who crafts potions and bombs on the fly to tear apart a crowd, or a Paradox Mage and change the perspective through the manipulation of spacetime itself. Each class has tons of abilities and skill trees, and you can invest into specific types of abilities (say I wanted to focus on grappling instead of one-handed skills) to suit your tastes or your needs for that situation. Combat is a matter of knowing when to use your abilities and resource management. Using an ability puts it on a cooldown and uses up a certain percentage of a turn. Some abilities don't take any time at all, some may use up your entire turn. Each one has a different range, a different effect and a different cost. Summoning skeletons, controlling minds, throwing enemies across the room, and stopping time are among the many abilities you can learn within the game.\n\nAbility costs are an important element. Early classes such as Mages and Warriors may use mana, which is about as straightforward as it gets. The more advanced professions may use alternative resources such as Hate, which is built by attacking and being attacked - or Paradox, which can be used freely, but the more it's used, the higher the chance for you to be affected by random effects such as teleporting and spell backfire. Learning how to effectively manage these resources is half of the challenge, and as you get stronger and fight tougher enemies you'll need every bit of your wits and patience if you want to make it out alive. As with other roguelikes, there's of course plenty of equipment and items to find, and it ranges from armor and weapons with random stats to powerful, unique items that may have a little more behind them.\n\nWhile it's not central to the game in any way, there actually is quite a bit of information on the world you're in. You'll find little lore pages scattered around the world which tell you just a little bit more about Maj'Eyal. For anyone who doesn't care, the game doesn't force this on you in any way, but for those who want a little extra, it's there.\n\nThe game actually has a wonderful presentation given the genre. The little tiles for the characters and maps look quite nice and I can totally tell what I'm looking at, so there's that. The music is nothing to write home about but it's all good stuff and fits the environments well, making my dungeon crawls quite the enjoyable romp. The HUD and info are all pretty clear and easy to understand, and as you get more skills the hotbar expands so you've got everything in one place. You can play the entire thing with mouse, keyboard, or with both, which is nice. It's always nice to keep your options open and luckily there's a lot of em.\n\nInterestingly, there's also online servers. You can store your characters online and keep items in a cloud vault to transfer them between characters. If you access your profile online it'll show all your characters and everything, which is a neat touch. There's a global chat too and the community is very friendly, which is great! If you die, your death is also broadcasted to the entire server, so you have extra pressure. It's a needless feature, but a great one nonetheless.\n\n[h1]Key Points[/h1]\n+ Roguelike combat is indeed challenging and tactical\n+ Solid music that really helps with the atmosphere\n+ Classes are all fun to play and interesting\n+ Optional lore pages do great in providing players extra incentive and fleshing out the world\n+ Comprehensible and easy to use UI\n+ Serverside saves!\n\n[h1]Get If[/h1]\n- You LOVE roguelikes\n- Smashing goblins with energy blasts you rewound through time and blasting foes with your blood sounds like your cup of tea\n- You LOOOOVE roguelikes\n- You're looking for something combat-centric\n\n[h1]Final Verdict[/h1]\nA must-play, and it's cheap as dirt too.

Be prepared. \nThere will be scenarios where you can't be prepared and you will experience 'cheap' deaths. Such is the nature of roguelikes. Anything can happen.

I figured that a game with such a high rating must have something going for it that I wasn't seeing and that I needed to keep giving it \"just a bit more time\".\n\nI think I got about 3-4 hours in before I realized that no amount of \"more time\" would ever reveal to me what others are seeing in this game.\n\nFor me I found it boring, frustrating and mostly luck-based. I really never felt challenged as a player or felt that I was required to truly evaluate what my next move was going to be.  It seemed to be: Either face-roll whatever was in front of me OR kite enemies to a choke-point and then do the obvious attack/skill/whatever.  Continue until you die from circumstances beyond your control.\n\nIt presents as a deep strategy game but I can honestly say I felt no strategy beyond absolute basics was ever required for the time I played.\n\nThere appears to be a lot of customization in the characters/classes/skills/etc but when it all comes out in terms of gameplay it felt quite shallow.  How can a game feel so shallow when there is so much apparent \"depth\" to the character customization?  I have no idea, but this game found the formula IMO.\n\nMy other big complaint is the UI (user interface) which I found using to be a greater challenge than playing the actual game.\n\nWhy won't my character move every 2nd click?  How do I close this window?  Why does this window close when I click OFF it, and this other window requires me to click ON it to close?  Why is there rollover text that needs scrolling, yet when I move the mouse over to scroll it different rollover replaces it before I get there?  Thank goodness I quit drinking because I would have gone rage city while I was still living in the bottle.\n\nThe UI- and I want to make it clear I am not talking about the graphics which are a different story - is very bad, very difficult to use, and feels dashed together haphazardly with little regard to how users need and expect information to be presented.  I praise the dev for ATTEMPTING to include font/UI scaling options which more games need.

So, the only way to not die and lose 20+ hours of gameplay is to... never get within 6 blocks of anyone for even a second? Also, it *kind of* deleted my character, even though I had used an item to get an extra life. The character won't show up anywhere, but when I try to create a new character with the same name, it says one exists.\n\n I believe the creators need to spend some time reworking enemy skills/powers and fix some major bugs before this game is considered complete.", "timestamp_created": 1469268459, "timestamp_updated": 1469294830, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24449181": {"recommendationid": "24449181", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032773348", "num_games_owned": 183, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 40103, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1471440708}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing-if-often-frustrating dungeon crawler:\n\nYou will die.

Items can be imbued with gems, which add to the item's stats. Gems can be found and bought, and you can also find more powerful artifact gems. However, all item imbuing is permanent. The result was never using the good gems for imbuing good items, while anxiously wondering whether and when I should. Instead of a bonus, every found artifact became a reminder about potentially shooting myself in the foot. \"Wanna imbue me? You know, it's permanent if you do. A better gem might be just around the corner. Better wait...but is it? You're constantly gimping yourself, you know...\"\n\n2) Extremely limited item transfer space. AFAIU, you'll get transfer space for one item for every 2 euros you've paid for the game. With the base game at 7 euros, that'd result in a massive quantity of 3 items you can transfer. However, you can find tens - or even hundreds of artifacts in one playthrough. Also, the transfer space can be reached in later game only, never allowing you the possibility of starting fresh characters with good quality equipment. The permanent socketing -issue raises its head in here as well, since different character classes require different items. \"Used that nice artifact gem in the sword of your now-overleveled fighter?

As an added bonus, the creator has been pushing out steady and meaningful updates for years.

This is partly due to my lack of time, and partly due to the fact that I jump from one game to the next at a rapid rate. Few games can hold my attention for very long, as many are quickly consigned to the heap of unplayed or lightly games cluttering my Steam collection.\n\nTales of Maj'Eyal is one of the few that have captured my interest and kept my interest, as one of only 7 or 8 games that I've played beyond 50 hours (four of which are either MMOs or server-based games where I idle). \n\nPart of the reason that Tales of Maj'Eyal is so special to me is that it is both flexible and complex at the same time. As with many of the other rogue-likes that I have played, Tales of Maj'Eyal features some potentially difficult moments and countless opportunities for deaths. When I first started playing Tales of Maj'Eyal, I died quite often in Trollmire, one of the starting zones. Even now, with more than 50 hours under my belt, it's still not uncommon for me to face various mid to high level enemies (stone throwing giants and dragons in particular) that can potentially one-shot my character.\n\nAnd here's where the first appeal of Tales of Maj'Eyal comes in. Unlike many rogue-likes, death doesn't mean the end of your character. In the standard adventure mode, you can come back to life after one death (or more often, as you level). In exploration mode, you can come back to life an infinite number of times. Not only that, the resurrection NPC allows you to resurrect on the world map instead of right where you died, especially helpful if you went into battle against an enemy that you have no chance of beating. If you want the standard rogue-like permadeath mode, Tales of Maj'Eyal offers that too, along with three difficulties (Easy, Normal, Hard). Even if this sort of convention goes against standard rogue-likes, it does make this game more forgiving and more open to someone like me who has limited time to play and/or start over new characters. \n\nWhen I do want to experiment with new characters and playstyles, Tales of Maj'Eyal offers a fair range of both races and classes. Each of these races and classes has different skill trees, and one playthrough offers a different experience from the next. I started out playing a defensive warrior type, then moved on to play an archer showering arrows, then a summoner leading an army, and now am experimenting with a mage that manipulates time. As you play through the game and complete tasks and quests, even more options are unlocked.\n\nThis flexibility and complexity is what makes Tales of Maj'Eyal the perfect rogue-like for me. Oh sure, other rogue-likes offer benefits that Tales of Maj'Eyal doesn't. Dungeons of Dredmor has (in my opinion) better item mechanics and better art. Elona (YMMV) offers more complexity, and there are so-called action rogue-likes that might provide more instant gratification without so much frustration. I suppose the graphics are somewhat outdated as well (though, pretty good compared to many other rogue-likes).\n\nWhen I first started playing Tales of Maj'Eyal, I thought of the game's relationship to the original Rogue similar to that of World of Warcraft to Everquest. Perhaps it might be insulting to compare Tales of Maj'Eyal to World of Warcraft, but some elements of this comparison are apt. LIke WoW, Tales of Maj'Eyal makes the rogue-like more accessible, more graphically attractive, and hopefully, more popular to a general audience.\n\nThat last element is what I truly want to become a reality. I have no idea how popular Tales of Maj'Eyal actually is (not being much of a forum goer or researcher on the topic), but I feel like it definitely deserves far more attention and acclaim than it receives. Perhaps a mobile version might help improve its exposure to the general public?\n\nFor anyone who's interested or simply curious about this game, there's no reason not to give it a try. After all, the full base game, with most of the features, can be played for free on the Tales of Maj'Eyal official website. If you feel like the game is right for you, you can then buy it, either on the official website or on Steam to get the donator features (special class, various cosmetic features, vault, etc) and then, when you want more, buy the DLC expansions.\n\nIn short, why is Tales of Maj'Eyal a great game for me and potentially a great game for you? I think it comes down to the fact that Tales of Maj'Eyal is a rogue-like that can be accomodated to your tastes. The difficulty can be whatever you want it to be, the playstyle can be whatever you want it to be, and the game is sufficiently long enough and filled with quests and lore that it'll be hundreds of hours before you, me, or anyone else could come close to experiencing it all.\n\nAgain, there's no harm in giving it a try. Download the game on the website to see if it's right for you. If it isn't, then you'll just move on to something else. However, if you're like me, perhaps you will discover that Tales of Maj'Eyal is a gem of a game, one that really stands out from the others and shines like a beacon of a light in the vast collection of games available on Steam.", "timestamp_created": 1465375361, "timestamp_updated": 1465375371, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.632098", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23432121": {"recommendationid": "23432121", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026722388", "num_games_owned": 566, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 1263, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1465301276}, "language": "english", "review": "I am pretty sure this game is a very good rogue-like game.

Tales of Maj'Eyal (ToME) simply offers the best roguelike experience one could get: deep, nuanced gameplay that is not only highly customizable and replayable but also accessible to even someone who's new to the genre.\n\nOne of the greatest hurdles that roguelike games have in appealing to the mainstream is the massive complexity that can be seen in some roguelikes. ToME, in fact, is a testament to this - featuring the most number of unique classes that I've ever seen in a game, all of which have differing playstyles and specializations, ranging from the ever-reliable warrior to shield-bearing mages manipulating earth magic to combat alchemists controlling massive golems. In most roguelikes, this complexity is rarely explained - and some would attest to finding out what X item is for as a part of the roguelike charm. What makes ToME remarkable, though, is making this complexity as accessible as possible. The tooltips for each skill, talent, or item not only gives concise, pertinent information that is easily understandable but even features some lore or description - which, in combination with in-game lore fleshes out a massive and detailed world.\n\nThe graphics also are very pleasing. They obviously are not as polished or as pretty like the Endless series (Dungeon of the Endless etc), but the individual NPC/PC tiles have a tabletop RPG feel and further help flesh the world out with great visuals. The sound shines through in this game - the background music for each zone fits the zone's theme well without distracting the player.\n\nReplayability is also one of the major criteria that roguelikes are measured with. ToME is, in all seriousness, the absolute best value game - there are so many race and class combinations you can try, and within one class there are several ways of playing. A great non-spoiler example of this would be the Rogue, which can focus on hit-and-run stealth tactics, using debilitating poisons and tricks to bring down enemies to their knees, or using a variety of traps to contain and damage foes. One of the absolute best examples of this would be [b](spoiler)[/b] [spoiler]the melee/ranged hybrid Temporal Warden class, which simply has so many options and gameplay styles: Bounce around the map, doing damage and teleporting out of sight all in the blink of an eye (Threaded Combat); Summon entities to fight with you (Temporal Hounds); Bend space and time to prevent damage to you and stop enemies in their tracks (Stasis); or even focus your attacks on one enemy as you seal their fate (Fate Weaving)[/spoiler]. There's simply so many things you can try that even with a non-procedural map and game flow there is still almost limitless replayability to the game - if you can beat it, that is!\n\nI've played roguelikes for a long while - coming from classics like Angband, to modern games that stretch the limits of the genre such as Dungeon of the Endless and Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead, and to modern reimaginings and improvements on the genre - where games like Elona and ToME fall. While most modern roguelikes stretch the definition and innovate the genre in so many ways, ToME sticks close to the genre's roots and provides a high quality, high value gameplay experience. Thus, Tales of Maj'Eyal stands tall as the absolute best that the roguelike genre can offer.", "timestamp_created": 1464073250, "timestamp_updated": 1464073332, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522785", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23155401": {"recommendationid": "23155401", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960771531", "num_games_owned": 194, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 477, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1457370951}, "language": "english", "review": "Looks ok, is super bad.", "timestamp_created": 1464010151, "timestamp_updated": 1464010151, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.213734", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23105350": {"recommendationid": "23105350", "author": {"steamid": "76561198158543036", "num_games_owned": 96, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1378, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489243205}, "language": "english", "review": "first, it is a great game!!!\nbut why the heck whenever i create a new game, it just says LAU ERROR and jumps back to the main menu. i all ready report this problem a mouth ago, but no feedback. \ncan someone helps me? :(", "timestamp_created": 1463780981, "timestamp_updated": 1463780981, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500550", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23052956": {"recommendationid": "23052956", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041513975", "num_games_owned": 240, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3927, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499746627}, "language": "english", "review": "Magnificent game.

However, I have yet to play a game compelling enough to make me want to take the time to write a review; until now.\n\nTales of Maj'Eyal is a rare kind of game. On the surface, it doesn't look like much, but there is so much depth and complexity to this game, its simple appearance doesn't do it any justice (not that there is anything wrong with the appearance). I say this is rare because I feel that most games do the opposite; they may have amazing visuals, but often fall short when it comes to depth and complexity. Visuals don't hold my interest very long if the game doesn't have much else to offer. What it lacks in visuals, it makes up for in mechanics.\n\nThis game is a rogue-like RPG, but it changes a few things up. For one, there is no need to eat. Some may argue that this detracts from the rogue-like experience, and normally I would probably agree, but I feel that this game is more focused on the tactical combat aspect as opposed to the survival aspect, and I commend it in that regard. Another difference is the lack of potions. Instead of potions, which require farming to replenish, this game uses something called inscriptions, in the form of runes or infusions. These inscriptions fill the same role as potions, but they operate on a cooldown instead of being limited-use, effectively eliminating any need for farming potions, which is a fantastic idea, in my opinion.\n\nThe game is difficullt. You will die, a lot. At the time of writing this review, I have 376.8 hours under my belt and I have only beaten the game once, but I don't plan on giving up any time soon. One thing that makes the unforgiving nature of the game more bearable are the persistent unlocks. When you first boot up the game, you will have a relatively limited selection of birth options, in the form of races and classes. As you play, you unlock more birth options permanently, in addition to unlocking new game modes and even skill trees. There is a ton of replayability here.\n\nThe developers of this game are consistently polishing the game and considering feedback from the community. A cool feature of this game is an in-game chat room where you can ask for tips, discuss strategies, and talk directly to developers. It's a great feature and is probably the closest thing to multiplayer we will see in a game like this. You can tell that the developers poured their blood, sweat, and tears into this game to make something exceptional. And they have succeeded.\n\nThis game is nearly perfect in my eyes. It is an exemplary rogue-like, and although it does some things a little differently, it does them extremely well. It has come such a long way and gets better every day. Do not hesitate if you are on the fence. Send me a personal message and I will convince you. This game is worth every penny and the developers deserve support for the great work that they do.\n\n10/10 Would get clobbered into troll soup again.\n\nTLDR; Buy this game.", "timestamp_created": 1463158677, "timestamp_updated": 1463158677, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.635563", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22950897": {"recommendationid": "22950897", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990405295", "num_games_owned": 286, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 3984, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505941345}, "language": "english", "review": "I cannot say enough good things about ToME: the enemies are wildly varied, it plays like a love letter to the early 90's Indie RPG's, the difficulty is obscene, items, classes, mods, bosses, elite's, in game chat, and a completely free to play version at  http://te4.org/\n\nOnce you sink in ~50 hours in the FTP version, come to Steam and throw the dev $7 to encourage him to keep going.

Also not much incentive to buy anything as a mage either.\n- Although dungeons have random layouts, the campaign mode is pretty much the same every time. This can make the beginning of the game tedious once you've done it several times and it doesn't really change\n\nNeutral:\n- Graphics.

Tales of Maj'Eyal or TOME is clone of ADOM. The keybinding are the same, classes are the same and fans of the original will find many more similarities. If I didn't enjoying play or rather enjoying dying in the original game, I probably would enjoy this game more. \n\nMy general thoughts about the game (trying to keep it balanced)\nI enjoyed the different classes. Making decisions to improve my character. You always feel like you are improving. However your characters skills may improve, overall the game felt incredibly stale and boring. Who cares about the items? the weapons? the books? This is what I turn my attention to next: looting system and gameplay.\n\nIn TOME, I pick up a few weapons to kill a few more enemies more quickly as I mindlessly and easily kill them. I really didn't get any satisfaction from looting.  This is because TOME is just sooo much easier than the original as well as TOME doesn't give you the chance to just pick up a weapon and try it. In ADOM, you can dig at the walls, getting some rocks (if your axepick doesn't break) where you can use to throw at the invading enemies. This is totally eliminated in TOME. You need a talent to even use a bow or sling? Come on! This meant for my playthrough I just had many millions of mindless, predictably leveled and simple enemies to grind my way through. Great for fans of WOW who love the grind and level up your character, but boring for everyone else. In ADOM, you are just one slime mold, hard armoured enemy, or river from losing your cherished weapon. In TOME, who cares? Your weapon will never get damaged. In ADOM, if you pick up a special wand of teleportation with 2 charges, it could easy save your life in a tough pinch. Without that special item, you could easily die. If you carefully zap that wand when you have no other escape, it could save your life if your luck is with you. If luck is against you, you could still die and unlike TOME with almost infinite resaves (roguelike my ass!) there is no teleporting back in the game once you died. If you used that wand too early, you might not have it later when you REALLY need it. Even a decision like using a wand was just sooo much more important in ADOM. In TOME, who cares? You quickly get the tp spell on a 9 turn cooldown. In comparison, many games I didn't even run into the wand even once. So when you got the loot in ADOM, it really meant something. In TOME, looting was just a tedious chore. \n\nLet me explain more about the difference between TOME (the clone) and the original by way of a story. In ADOM, I remember being excited about finding every single item. Often high powered stuff would drop that was far above your level. If you got that loot, you were pretty much golden (until it rusted, broke, was stolen by a thief, obliterated by spells, or burned up). Then when your prized weapon invariably was destroyed, you realized that you only had 7 rocks and two loaves of bread before starvation or death. Then after defeating a kobold, you realize that he dropped a book containing powerful magic. You hear something being killed in the level, so you open a door,  lock it and begin to read the book. You feel more hunger and as the hunger continues to get stronger, you finish the book, and learn the magic. You then remember that you carefully dropped some food and some extra weapons on some stairs a few levels above. As you use your new powerful magic to destroy the enemies coming for you, you begin to feel more and more hungry (first see yellow notification for hunger, then an orange notification). As I'm describing this, I slipping a bit into the character of the game. The graphics were non-existent, just letter characters for each enemy but the many choices you could make in the game made you feel like you were in the game. Getting back to the story, as our intrepid hero continues slowly towards the stairs, and the notifications continue to flash more dire, you realize that your hero is not going to make it. You look in your inventory. You notice a seed and a kobold corpse. You quickly eat the seed. You take one more step, staving off death for one more step. You are only a few steps from death. You look in the inventory and now you see a rotting kobold corpse. You realize that you are dead. You eat the kobold corpse, become paralyzed and stunned. After unsuccessfully trying to move, you suddenly die in two turns, still close to the stairs and the weapon and food drop. After heroically surviving the loss of your prized possession, your hero dies from starvation so close to his goal. This is what I loved about ADOM, getting really high level loot, getting attacked by surprising high level enemies, almost dying, surviving before finally dying. \n\nI have lost many many characters in ADOM. It was really interesting trying to discover the code for the game. I tried my best, but like Sid Meier's Pirates, the game was next to impossible to finish. TOME has many elements that I loved about the original. Discovering the Infinite Dungeon, Troll's Cave, Gladiator Tournament all felt cool to me once again. I still really enjoy the premise behind TOME. I think I'll probably eventually end up playing more of this game. Maybe if I can create some overpowered raccoons/companions to follow me around, I'll feel like less of a letdown. I had a lot of happy memories playing ADOM. Throwing massive stones throw doorways to break the doors down into very much needed wood that I could use to make arrows was a lot of fun. Even creating loyal zombies to follow me around as a necromancer was a lot of fun. Fighting powerful enemies that could stun you, blind you, or do many dastardly things to you was a lot of fun. If I can dramatically ramp up the difficulty, TOME might do it for me. \n\nI only don't recommend it because as a die hard fan, I feel they could have done so much more. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1462279165, "timestamp_updated": 1462279165, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.438877", "comment_count": "9", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22771650": {"recommendationid": "22771650", "author": {"steamid": "76561198202844797", "num_games_owned": 196, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 449, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 23, "last_played": 1513295489}, "language": "english", "review": "Tales of Maj'Eyal is an unending world of exploration (and torture) in which YOU control the pace.\n\nIf you are a Rogue-like and RPG fan then you should buy this, really, buy this NOW.

Nothing new unlocked on this run (at least 6 hours spent on it). \nPlaying berserker, above level 30, lost my last life because I was teleported during life-saving skill which could not work in this location (Using unstoppable and being thrown to fearscape). Boom. Random death. Hours gone. \nCountless deaths while playing archmage, killing myself with my own fireball blast hitting invisible enemies who were too close. \nSome of those deaths could be avoided, but there are ones against which you are helpless. \"Memento mori\" is not my favourite thing to be reminded of while playing a game. \n\nIf you like spending way too many hours only to lose and start again, apparently you are a true rougelike fan and this game is for you. If you care about the time you spend on games, go play something else instead. \n\n\n\nTL;DR: game is awesome and addictive, but you will die a lot in unfair ways and you will probably wast countless hours.", "timestamp_created": 1458592133, "timestamp_updated": 1458592187, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21957803": {"recommendationid": "21957803", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026159556", "num_games_owned": 49, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 9216, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486571761}, "language": "english", "review": "Awsome game!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1458528390, "timestamp_updated": 1458528390, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21945312": {"recommendationid": "21945312", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970330090", "num_games_owned": 206, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 304, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1457636067}, "language": "english", "review": "It's fun and well made roguelike with modern and nostalgic feel at the same time.

What is there to say about it? Well--\n\n-Odyessy was hit for 50 nature, 50 temporal, 30 fire-\n\n-Killed-\n\n[b][i]Ow.[/i][/b]\n\n[h1]Tales Of Maj'Eyal[/h1]\n\n~Spoiler Free Review!~\n--------NOTE---------\n\nThis review is based off the majority of my play with mods. For around 90% of my hours on the game, I have spent it with mods. I shall list what mods I used at the bottom of the review, but none are extreme enough to change any of the core concepts of the game. The mods I've used made information easier to understand.\n\nOooh boy. I absolutely love this game. I really, really do. If I had to pick a single game to bring with me into, say, Space, this game would be my pick, hands down.\n\n[h1]Community[/h1]\nYou know what's strange for a Rouge-lite game? Having encouragement to directly talk with the community. Yeah, strange, isn't it? Whenever you're in the game, and you're online...you're connected to the community with a button-press away. There's a window on your screen (that isn't intrusive) where people's achievements within the game and conversations are. You can link items and monsters you find to show off to others the items you've found, or to ask for strategies on creatures you've never faced before. I do reccomend a mod called \"Die In Obscurity\" so you don't see how every single person dies. It can overflow the chat at times. Afraid of spoilers from the community? No problem! The moment someone types something that's considered spoilerly, they will be sent to ToME Spoiler Chat. It's an automatic system, so you won't even see a glance of spoilers. I've NEVER had a issue with the community, and have had quite a few conversations with the dev himself, Darkgod. The moderators are absolutely awesome as well! Good on all of you!\n\nSo, yes, this is indeed a positive for the game. I encourage you, as well, to take part in the community!\n\n\n[h1]Combat[/h1]\nI'll talk about the story in a bit, but I believe this is to be the BIGGEST draw to the game. The combat.\n\nYou see, Tales Of Maj'Eyal is complex. This, sadly, can be a heavy drawback for those who would rather actually enjoy it. In every single turn (every single move you make) has a LOT of things considered, from the speed of projectiles flying at you, to how spells affect the enviorment are re-checked to apply their affect again, and how everyone runs around. This is perhaps one of the only turn-based RPGs I know that has a heavy emphasis on mobilty. You CANNOT, I REPEAT, CANNOT run around without a plan. You. Will. [b]DIE.[/b] Doesn't matter if you have badass armor and defense-increasing skills on. You cannot block everything or tank everything. Even TANKS in this game have to consider mobility, and know when it's time to run and reposition themselves. The only class that can remotely do this is Bulwark, which I feel is \"THE\" class everyone should play first. They have a rediculous amount of defense, but it won't get you too far in the game alone. Learning the game takes time, and many deaths.\n\nOn the bright side, this complex combat is actually very satisfying once you understand how it works. There's SO MANY WAYS TO END YOUR FOES. From [b][i]DEVOURING THEM[/i][/b] to [b][i]YELLING AT THEM TO DEATH.[/i][/b] The amount of classes is purely absurd, and to this day I've STILL not tried them all. On top of that, you have Races. Humans, Elves...There's many more, and each has sub-species within it. The reason why I won't say who they are, is because it's considered spoilers. Sorry. Although, I will say there's only a few races that have classes usable only by them, you can mix and match pretty much anything. There's a lot of depth in a single class, and with so many, there's a lot to learn here. On top of that, the loot is satisfying to obtain. I've even carried some things I couldn't use because it just sounded so badass. I ain't giving my Corpsebow to a mere shopkeeper!\n\nAlso, the difficulty settings are very varied. You have two different kinds that come into play when you play the game. Difficulty, and the Style of the Difficulty.\n\n{Easy}\n\n{Normal}\n\n{Nightmare}\n\n---and so on---   Those difficulties change how hard the game is. How strong foe's talents are, the level of the zones, and so on. The higher the difficulty, the more EXP you earn. There are three difficulties locked when you start the game.\n\nAnd the Styles:\n\n{Exploration}  Infinite lives. You are beyond death! The difficulty I say you should NEVER play, it ruins the experience. But if you don't like having a bad time, I won't judge you. There are a lot of gorgeous sights to see in the game.\n\n{Adventure} You gain lives on select level-ups. Simple, not overpowered, but not the core experience.\n\n{Rougelike} \"You ARE your character.\" You only have one life. The moment you die, your character is immediately deleted. :gameover: However! You can still find ways to revive yourself in game, such as a rare-as-it-can-get vial. THIS is the Style of difficulty I always play on. It's my preference.\n\n\n\n[h1]Appearance[/h1]\n\nIt's visuals....are alright. It's your typical fantasy style, but it's not too distracting for me, actually. It's the enviorment I'm in, so I roll with it. It's great for what it is, there's a LOT of variety here! You'll be in space, heaven and hell, wintery landscapes, swamps, and volcanoes! Personally, I like it. But I can see how people might be \"turned off\" by it. Honestly, there's not a lot to say. One of the few games I say imagination works in it's favor!\n\n\n\n[h1]Sound[/h1]\nIt serves it's duty. Spells sound like spells, fists sound like fists, steel sounds like steel. There's no glaring issue with the sound, but nor is there anything that stands out as supreme. The soundtrack? Well...The music in the game is the same, it serves what it's meant to do. I honestly have muted the music for a long time now, and have other things in the background, like the news or music. It's one of THOSE kinds of games, despite it's complexity, where you can focus on other things while playing it. It IS turn based, as well.\n\nOn that note, like how I feel with Sanctuary RPG, once I've played long enough, I'm \"in tune\" with the game, reading information at only a glance, making actions with speed and care. Even when I set the game down for a few weeks, I was very easilly able to get back into this state.\n\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\n\nThe story of Maj'Eyal is a fantasy, what would you expect? If you can suspend disbelief, you will find so much to read and learn about the word. Well written poems, stories, and last words of daring adventurers before you. There are several campaigns, but the one with the most amount of story is, well, \"Tales Of Maj'Eyal\". There is also the Arena and the Infinite Dungeon. Personally, the Arena isn't very fun to me, but I absolutely LOVE the Infinite Dungeon. You and the endless dungeon crawling experience that this game offers, with nothing in your way beyond blood thirsty monsters and glorious loot. It feels alive.\n\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nAll in all, there's not too many RPGs like this. Where it manages to be...a community driven single player game. It's definately unique in that regard. With such a cheap RPG, why not buy it? Well, the initial ramp of difficulty (and throughout the game, regardless of skill) requires stategy over going wild with a sword, so this isn't the kind of game you can sit down with if you have little time. It respects your time, however, and the community is very helpful, VERY alive...The sound and appearance will not satisfy everyone, but it serves what it lives for. Things sound exactly like they would. I don't think giving it a \"Score\" would satisfy myself with the review, so I'll simply give the answer of \"I highly reccomend this.\" To ALL RPG fans!\n\n\n\n[h1]Mods that I use and reccomend.[/h1]\n(gahh there is no more room on the review so here have a pastebin with the last tidbit)\n\nhttp://pastebin.com/m2genWSA", "timestamp_created": 1458061937, "timestamp_updated": 1458061937, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.585024", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21853421": {"recommendationid": "21853421", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037748415", "num_games_owned": 76, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 20112, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1458928140}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best games I have ever played.\n\nWell designed, well developed, well balanced...tons of classes and content, you owe it to yourself to give it a try.\n\nIt can be quite challenging, and rewarding, any time invested in learning about the game will be well worth it.", "timestamp_created": 1458054907, "timestamp_updated": 1458054907, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497809", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21811310": {"recommendationid": "21811310", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053381834", "num_games_owned": 396, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 4265, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496214994}, "language": "english", "review": "Orks did nothing wrong", "timestamp_created": 1457866622, "timestamp_updated": 1457866622, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502370", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21804906": {"recommendationid": "21804906", "author": {"steamid": "76561198206028628", "num_games_owned": 63, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 403, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1457993478}, "language": "english", "review": "It took a little while for me to get into TOME but once I did, I really started to have a blast with it! \n\nThe graphics are super simple which is totally fine since they're not everything.

So with that in mind, this is my \"first\" review. My experience within this game is limited (37.9 hrs at time of post), but my time with this game may be much more when looked at in the future. Now lets get to the meat of the review, the pros and cons.\n\nPros:\n\n+Great, meticulous tactical gameplay\n+An intricate skill tree system (Which can be expanded through various events)\n+Unforgiving (given that it is a rougelike game)\n+Dedicated support from DarkGod, the sole developer (He has been working on this game for over 17 years!)\n+Good support for mods and addons\n+Enticing lore! The world feels very alive and the stories are very well thought out.\n+Fun and deep character creation, especially as you unlock classes and races\n+Interesting classes (I bet your other RPGs don't have Oozemancers or Temproal Wardens!)\n+A good community\n+Very challenging and it will test your abilities\n+The game can be downloaded for free on its website. You won't have access to some small features but you can unlock those by donating money to DarkGod. Otherwise, you can just buy through Steam and get those goodies right off the bat, like I did. \n+An exploration mode with infinate lives. You can accustom yourself to the game and tinker with various builds and whatnot (This is a special perk for those who donate should you download it from its website) \n+Alternative modes to play should you get bored of the main story lines (Infinite Dungeon and Arena) \n\nCons:\n\n-Graphics are quite dated but this is largely a non-issue. The developer started working on this game in the late 1990s so the engine that the game runs on is very old. Could potentially deter gamers who have only really experienced more recent games like Skyrim, Diablo 3, etc. But you know, their loss.\n-Can be rage inducing. The amount of times you die is ridiculous and due to the RNG within the game, you can get very unlucky and run into a monster or mob that erases your pixelated ass. But hey, you knew what you signed up for ;)\n-Bugs, crashing, etc. Though these are rare, there have been hiccups which might kill you or just cause you to crash. (I know of one with a passive which allows you to speed up immensely for a short time after killing an enemy and moving with it may cause your game to crash. It has happened to me many times but it was just an annoyance since I set back to my previous save point) It's minor, but something to keep in mind since you can be punished brutally if you make a mistake.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThis is just a great game and one that recieves so much love. Being someone who is relatively new to the \"Rougelike\" genre of games, this game has got me hooked! Outside of the few minor annoyances, this is a full, flushed out game. This thing has recieved more time and dedication than most marriages do in the U.S. (lol) There is so much story and content to this game, most of which I have yet to experience for myself. This game is frustrating in the best of ways. It drives you to go further, try new classes, races, etc. DarkGod (from what I have seen and heard) is very active and continues to work on content for this game. One example is the new expansion he released in February, \"Embers of Rage\" and he has hinted at more expansions that he is or will be working on in the future. He also will create special events in the game and play with those currently playing. I wholeheartedly reccomend this game to those who enjoy a good RPG or rougelike game. It is one in a long string of games that I have enjoyed so much that I binged on it.

This puke was so mighty that it not only healed him and removed status effects, but also damaged opponenets and cleansed their buffs, all in a large radius around my knight. Combined with my power to project a path of sunshine that took no time to traverse, I'd skate into a room full of baddies, glowing all holy light, spew vomit, and then finish everything off with a direct invocation of the sun that's more like a quasar igniting at the edge of a blackhole.\n\nDid I mention that my random lamp item that made me undead was called 'Taintblight'?\n\nThis collision of three entirely different abilities and a crazy and evocative random name generator is only one example of dozens such synergies and strange stories that I have experienced in playing Tales of Maj'Eyal.\n\nOf course much of that imagery came from my own willingness to fill in the blanks because Tales of Maj'Eyal is a roguelike run by one guy (as far as I can tell), who has packed in a tremendous amount of lore, options and imagination. The graphics are like sprites from a nineties turned-based game that would run on a 486. The sounds aren't really any better. The muscial score is acceptable, but since the whole affair runs at my leisure, I listen to absolutely anything else while playing.\n\nBut the value in this game isn't in its looks, but in all the options, variations and odd enemies it offers.\n\nWhile the game can be played like a true roguelike (one life and you're done), there are several difficulty and re-spawn options that help make the game more accessible to players looking for different challenge (and frustration) levels. There are also several unlockable races and classes whose progress is tracked across multiple playthroughs. By opening up more options, the game stays fresh the longer you play.\n\nOf course, having so many class and race combinations leads to wild imbalances in capability. Some combinations simply become mathematically better, overall. However, the game throws so many different kinds of enemies and effects that attack, weaken and kill your character in so many ways that almost any character will expose an Achilles Heel at some point in a playthrough.\n\nThe game has incredible difficulty spikes, so playing true roguelike is recommened only for those with tremendous intestinal fortitude. I recall losing a rogue-like character 20 hours into the game due to missing a debuff icon that I didn't recognize, laid on me by an unusual random boss that was blocked by one of the over-sized two-block larger enemies. Of course, since it's turn based I could have taken a beat and re-examined the fifteen different effects, good and bad, that were on my character at that moment, so the mistake is ultimately mine.\n\nThat said, I didn't play again for a few days.\n\nThis does bring up a complaint about the game's lack of documentation. There are a ton of systems packed in, entire mechanics that might only be encountered on playing a particular character class. These often behave differently from every other resource in the game. Am I expending this resource straight away or do I have to build it up? Does this resource have a conflict or synergy with my armor choices or my other talents?\n\nAll these esoteric, imaginative and rule breaking powers interact in ways that aren't always clear. After logging over a thousand hours in this game, over three years, I still don't know what a few of the stats mean.\n\nWhile most of the dungeons are procedurally generated, some smaller zones are always the same and the overland map only varies based off a handful of bonus zones that require prerequisites to appear. This sameness of the larger world and the horrifically imbalanced and hazardous random patrols make travel between dungeons tedious. But this is a relatively small criticism since the overland travel isn't a large portion of gameplay.\n\nIf roguelikes are your bag, this one offers both a sense of progression from overall play by doling out new classes and races with unlocks, as well as a wide variety of enemies and all sorts of crazy loot. The difficulty spikes can be tremendous, so that the higher difficulties really demand use of the game's clairvoyance and/or movement powers to survive. This game seeded and fostered my imagination and provided all sorts of unusual combinations of gear, talents and events to keep my thoroughly entertained.

It requires a lot of reading, thinking, and well thought out decisions. This is not the game you just jump into and start hacking stuff up. You can sort of do that on the easiest difficulty, but this isn't the game where that's fun since the combat is just moving into the other target. \n\nIt's hard to explain what is good about this game, because I don't quite know. I do know I would recommend it to people, especially at 6.99 (I was lucky enough to get it for $1.74) because I am enjoying it a lot.

The skill system is one of them. You can choose multiple skills, but you have a limited amount of skill points. Some really stand out, while others may seem underwhelming. Every single skill has a purpose in one way or another, and has a use.\n\nThe class system is another one. There are 10 races in the base game, all with different skills. You start with a small handful, and can unlock the others by playing the game. There are 26 classes with different playstyles in the regular game, 19 of those unlockable by playing the game as well. There's one \"bonus\" class that can get any skill from any tree in the game, and you unlock that one by beating the game once. DLC adds 5 more classes, and 4 different races to play as.\n\nThere's also little risk to trying this game out.

Plenty of traditional mechanics under a great looking UI. You can tell this is a work of love and effort from a dedicated single dev.

Nice to take your time and have monsters patiently wait for you to decide what to do.\n\nAs for cons, the biggest is balance, especially after mid-level (15+ or so). Initially the content matches your level, you're using all your skills, and there is plenty of challenge. But eventually you either go into areas that are way too low and have boring gameplay of \"press Z to autoexplore, smash things, health never goes below 99%\". Either that or you run into some random purple boss who 3-4 shots you. Or better yet a purple boss who is WAY higher level, like 35 when you're 15, and you have no chance.\nSo that can all be a bit frustrating. But when the balance is great the game is great. It just happens a little too irregularly for me.

(those aren't major, however the DLC is and is in my opinion definitely worth it)\nSo do test it first before buying and then buy it if you want to support the creator (mostly a single guy by the way).\n\nThings that are great:\n\n-It's in many parts a traditional roguelike (which I am a fan of), that means: turn-based combat, procedurally generated dungeons.\n\n-It's in some parts more forgiving than traditional roguelikes: option to choose between permadeath, a limited number of lives or unlimited lives (while the last takes away from the fun imo), multiple difficulty settings (easier, which will not get you any achievements, normal, which is pretty hard, on to various degrees of insanity)\n\n-the most interesting choice of classes i know from virtually anywhere: There are the classic Berserker, Archer, Archmage but also things like Mindslayer, Oozemancer, Brawler, Solipsist.\n\n-Every class is played differently: due to completely different sets of skills and build possibilities, each class has its own unique playstyle.\n\n-no grinding: all dungeons can only be cleared once, there are no respawning mobs. Additionally there are no consumables, these are replaced by \"inscriptions\" which are infinitely usable, but on a cooldown, meaning there is nothing you have to save up for a big bossfight, but you still have to think about when you use what in that fight.\n\n-impressive gameworld: The sheer amount of lore there is for you to find is impressive. This is a point where it differs from many classic roguelikes: It has a main quest, a story, and lots of backstory, all of which I personally found to be interesting and engaging. The various dungeons feel interesting and different.\n\n-it's challenging: You actually have to either think about what you are doing, or prepare to die a lot. You might die a lot even if you do until you figure some things out. To me that is a good thing, to others it might not be i guess, but that's what exploration mode (unlimited lives) is for: figuring stuff out.\n\n-great community: Why is this important? While it is not a multiplayer game, there is an in game online chat. It shows character deaths and character achievements (this can be turned on/off) and can be used for chatting. This is extremely helpful for asking about things you might need to know, and in my experience the community will be more than happy to help.\n\nThe things you might not like:\n\n-Graphics: This is a Tileset-based game. It doesnt feature great animations or anything like that apart from spell effects. If that is extremely off-putting to you, i'm sorry. As to the tileset itself, I like it, others might not.\n\n-It may not be easy to get into: There are many stats to keep track of, sometimes making it hard to decide which items to take over others, the GUI is great in my opinion, but at the start it can take a bit to get used to it. So if you have any questions while playing: dont hesitate to ask in chat!\n\n-it's challenging: see above\n\n-If you are an achievement completionist, you might get into problems with this game. Just a warning.\n\nAll  in all, i very much recommend to try it.\nAnd dont give up after a few deaths :P", "timestamp_created": 1453286815, "timestamp_updated": 1453287501, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502882", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20619937": {"recommendationid": "20619937", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993729292", "num_games_owned": 595, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 11900, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509169068}, "language": "english", "review": "Interesting and engaging story, Gripping roguelike action, where you always feel like you're invincible, but there's a voice in the back of your head reminding you that you thought that every other time and at any moment you're about to die if you're not prepared for everything.

Don't let the graphics fool you, the gameplay is incredibly deep with a large amount of races, classes, enemies, quests, skills, items and free choice. ToME is all about gameplay and less about graphics, kind of like Dwarf Fortress. Even the dialogue and lore (there is a lot to read if you so desire) is well-written and the world is interesting to explore and uncover its mysteries.\n\nThere are a lot of stats but they are all straightforward and easy to find. You will rarely be confused about what a certain stat does, and you don't even need to know about everything. You can dive in straight for some proper min-maxing or just play and learn as you go. I recommend to start with an easier, straightforward class like the Bulwark. Then later you can try out the more difficult to master classes with interesting names like the Oozemancer, Stone Warden or Paradox Mage. There is enormous build variety. You can unlock the more specialist classes, skill trees and even races just by playing the game. By spending some extra points you can even use skill trees that are not available to your class from the start. \n\nBattles are very engaging and for the more difficult fights you will have to think about your next turn. With plenty of skills and items available you can really think about your strategy. Or maybe you don't want to fight at all, there is no shame in running to come back later and finish that boss when you're stronger. The game appears to be very well balanced, which is a great achievement if you consider the enormous build variety.\n\nThe game is large, there are a lot of places to explore, the only problem i have with the world is that every new character has to pass through the same locations which can get a little boring if you die a lot (which you will). Luckily all maps are randomly generated and there are several game modes (infinite lives, multiple lives, 1 live), so you don't have to go all hardcore.\n\nToME was made for pure fun. You don't like mindlessly exploring empty maps for a single piece of loot or to find the exit? Just press the auto-explore button and skip all that nonsense. Your character will automatically explore and pick up everything until it sees an enemy. There is very little grinding just to get XP, almost everything you do is part of a quest or will lead to one. Are you overleveled? The game will ask you if you want to skip the whole area! If you manage to get far enough in to the game you will get your own flying fortress with a small shared stash that you can expand by donating more. There's also the (in-game!) Steam Workshop that contains a great many mods to make your life in ToME even more enjoyable. And an in-game chat with plenty of helpful and experienced players.\n\nDo you like Steam Achievements? This game has 1395 of them!\n\nTotally recommended to any true fans of rogue-likes and skill-based RPG's.

More beginner friendly among the major roguelikes, in my opinion. And it's addictive. For people like me who are not so good at planning one's own character, there are many class guides in the official forum, which is very helpful.\n\nThere is only one aspect that is not that great, that's its graphic tile.

To have a huge, randomized world to explore, hundreds of enemies to battle, nigh infinite loot to find, and dozens upon dozens of characters to try? There are more attempts at just such perfection now but few have reached the heights of Tales of Maj'Eyal in scope or depth. As long you can get past some balance and aesthetic hangups, you might get your wish in this one.\n\nToME, as I'm going to abbreviate it from here on, is a roguelike RPG of incredible scale. Right from character creation you have dozens of combinations of races and classes to choose from, with more to unlock as you explore the world. There's plenty of exploring to do across said massive world as well, what with the layout of the continents and dungeons randomized each time. Enemies and loot are even more randomized, scattered throughout in ways that encourage you to explore every nook and cranny of every level of every dungeon. There are towns to visit and NPCs to take quests from, and though the main story quest is the same every time your start and some elements later are determined by your race and your class.\n\nEvery time you start a new character you're in for a dramatically different adventure in fact, just as you would expect from a quality roguelike. Right from the basics there's a huge amount of variance between the classes. You have everything from different flavors of warriors and archers to exotic professions like chronomancers and abominations. Leveling up gains you new stat points to spend, skill points in two separate classes of skills, and occasionally the chance to learn entirely new skills. Coupled with the ridiculous amount of loot to find there's a lot of customizing to do, and dozens of skills to use on a single character between their class skills, racial skills learned skills, runes, infusions, and item-granted powers.\n\nIf all this sounds overwhelming, it really isn't because of how the game is played. ToME is turn-based at your pace, meaning things only happen when you move or attack. Attacking can be as simple as bumping into enemies to auto attack, or laying out combinations of skills over dozens of turns. And this is where the balance starts to become an issue, because for most fights you'll be doing the former. Most enemies in ToME are little more than filler, assuming you've been diligent in exploring and leveling. Despite the vast array of enemies to battle, many present little challenge. It's the rare unique enemies and ones with certain devastating abilities you have to watch out for, and in stark contrast with the rest of your foes these can end your life in one or two turns. Every single character I have lost has been to an unexpected boss or unique that wrecked me instantly after cleaving effortlessly through their minions.\n\nTo its credit, ToME has a wide assortment of difficulty settings, and the default level gives you several lives to experiment with before succumbing to permadeath. But it's a band-aid on a much deeper balance wound. Most of the adventuring in ToME presents so little challenge you can run on autopilot, until suddenly dying to the one thing in the room that poses a threat. This creates a strange whiplash effect between mounting boredom and sudden frustration. And the methods for overcoming a challenging boss won't always be clear thanks to the immense volume of stats and abilities that you normally don't have to keep much track of. Even after a dozen hours it can be hard for me to tell what my character is ready for.\n\nThe result is a game that's not too daunting to get into, but presents a real challenge to master. Every attempt is a long and gratifying series of small discoveries and victories before the inevitable end comes. There's plenty of unique items, new classes, and lore to uncover even if beating the game isn't in the cards. I still haven't come close to whatever the end is, but after 20 hours I'm still not tired of the meat grinder. Maybe I really can play this forever, and even if you can't, you'll get a lot of quality adventuring out of it.\n\n\n\nDid you enjoy this review?

These obviously could have be done better, like for example automatically unlock lesser difficulties ones when you achieve one (what's the point of doing the same achievement on normal if you just got it on insane ?)\n- a few crashes (mostly when starting a new game or loading one, strangely : I don't remember having a crash while in game)\n- it is possible to get stuck : on my last infinite dungeons run, I ended up in a \"corner\" where the door disappeared (on purpose) and the walls were not diggable. As I had not found any teleportation means yet, my only option was to suicide (target my talents at myself).

Given that I'll never play on anything but roguelike, that leaves me with a bunch of achievements I'll never get.\n\nOther than that, this is a great roguelike. It is class based so there are some choice moments when you really wish you could use that awesome item you found, but that's true of most of the genre. Most of what I've seen has been that good choices and skill synergy trumps RNG drops.\n\nStarting out, your choices are pretty limited. You need to fulfill certain requirements to unlock additional races and classes.

positive) reviews.\n\nFolks this game is great! The base version of this game is free and may help you to determine wether or not this game is for you.\n\nMy first experiences with this game were kinda \"meh\" not because the game is bad but just because i felt like it was hard to get into (that might be a personal thing tho). I made a big mistake by shoving it to the side for a while thinking this game wasnt for me. In a phase of boredom i picked this game up again and used my time to get into it and hell - I'm fascinated. i litteraly can't stop playing - this game has so much depth and so much to give for such a little price it's just wow.\n\nDarkgod is the prime example for a good game developer - give it for free and let the people choose wether or not to pay for it. I feel bad now for picking this gem up when it was on sale and i only payed about 70c so i donated another 5 Euro for now just because the game is so great (i'll probably donate even more just because i won't stop playing this game aslong as things are beeing developed for it)\n\n\nEnough for the story telling now lets get to the raw information:\n\n\nPro's:\n\nGreat story: you got ALOT of texts to read for background information about races , the past events , demons , long lost civilizations etc etc etc. if you realy want to you can get ALOT of information.\n\nGameplay: AMAZING - the game has so much depth telling you all about it would fill about 100's of sites so just go find out yourself you realy won't be disappointed. trust me on this.\nRoguelike typical RNG\ntons and tons and tons of randomly generated equipment aswell as our all beloved legendary equipment which stays the same.\nBrilliant skills and spells which would also be too much to talk about in detail right here.\n\nGraphics: Lovely oldschoolish graphics (i know it's not for everyone but for me personaly it's great.)\n\nActive developer: Darkgod is always working on this game , hell he even shows up online regulary and starts random events for everyone thats playing in that moment ( this can be Zones , small buffs , useless but funny buffs or even other things which i'm not gonna mention.\n\nOnline community ingame: Okay now this one is great and probably my most favorite function in this game - even tho this is a singleplayer game it has an online function which is basicaly just a chat where you can link items , talk to people , see what other people do (deaths,archievements etc). This is especialy helpfull when starting out because the community is great and always helpfull (hey Xlambda , minmay etc :D). When you're more experienced it's still helpfull for lets say Item comparsion or just simple chatting while playing along.\n\n\nCons: A little hard to get into but as i said above that might just be me personally and yet it's not that hard just takes a little bit of time and dedication. \n\nThats about it.\n\n\nI give this game a 10/10 on my personal scale - im TOTALY in love with it and 'am planing to play it for a LONG time.\n\n\nDarkgod you're my hero.", "timestamp_created": 1448759973, "timestamp_updated": 1448759973, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19347594": {"recommendationid": "19347594", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992003907", "num_games_owned": 285, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 10575, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490676441}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a game that will wreck you, make you hate it, stop playing it for a few days, and then have you crawling back.

"last_played": 1438855011}, "language": "english", "review": "Tales of Maj'Eyal is a true Roguelike (i.e. it plays much like [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_(video_game)]Rogue[/url]).\n\n\nThe Good:\n\nIt is massive.  There's lots of classes, areas, items, and spells, and things to do.  Very little feels redundant or samey.\n\nUnlike most Roguelikes, there is a plot.\n\nAs claimed, there is indeed no need to grind.\n\nPermadeath can be turned off with no penalty.  This partially makes up for many of the bad aspects of the game.\n\n\nThe Bad:\n\nTales of Maj'Eyal is a true Roguelike.  Most of its flaws are common to most members of the genre.\n\nLike most Roguelikes, there are horrendous balance problems.  You will frequently encounter creatures of widely varying levels in the same area.  Some of these enemies move so fast, and hit so hard, just seeing them on your screen almost guarantees death.  If you have permadeath on, and aren't a masochist, you're going to have a bad time.\n\nTurning permadeath off doesn't completely solve the balance problems.  It also just feels bad.  Resurrecting where you were, with full hit points and no negative statuses, with the enemies as you left them, results in you either being deathlocked or overpowered.  I would rather it have saved every 5 minutes, then load the save from 5 minutes ago when I die.  That would both feel fairer, and prevent the deathlock problem.  Being able to willingly back up further (lose more progress) would be even better insurance against being deathlocked.\n\nLike most Roguelikes, there are terrible guidance problems.  In most Roguelikes this is due to there being no guidance at all.  While Tales of Maj'Eyal has problems with [i]insufficient[/i] guidance, it does have some guidance, due to the main quest and side quests directing you to the \u2018next\u2019 areas.  However, sometimes you encounter strange interactive widgets and need to decide what, if anything, to do with them.  There is no guidance here, and if you do the wrong thing the results are often lethal.  Tales of Maj'Eyal has somewhat unique problems with [i]malicious[/i] guidance.  The main and side quests will frequently send you to places without any hint that you better purchase some items or allocate points in some abilities to counteract the next boss' game-breaking abilities, or simply lead you to locations full of enemies far beyond your level.  If you're going to play this, save yourself some frustration and just look everything that should have been in the game up on a wiki.\n\nYou will occasionally encounter wandering friendly characters.  They always need to be safely escorted out of the area.  There should be more variety in what they want from you.\n\n\nThe Ugly:\n\nA few people are complaining about the graphics.  Traditionally Roguelikes didn't [i]have[/i] graphics (or sound).  Everything was represented with text characters and you had to learn to read the screen (e.g. @ is the player character).  You could usually select a location on the screen for a more detailed explanation.  While many of us enjoyed using our imagination, it did prevent Roguelikes from being popular with the masses.  The few that have graphics now often adopted them due to running out of ASCII characters to represent things with, before Unicode support was widespread and good monospaced Unicode fonts were available.

You will learn the strategies, understand the tactics, shape your reactions to the situations appropriately, and you will conquer!  You will earn your end-game god-like status not by farming, or investing time at the expense of brainpower, you will earn it through sweat and, sometimes, tears of frustration, but you absolutely will earn it, and when you deal that final blow, you will feel like you truly accomplished something great...\n\n...and then you will start the process over again, learning a new class!\n\nI have had this game for many years now, and the constant updates keep it fresh.

The first tag is \"Rogue-like\", the second is \"RPG\". This is not a traditional \"learn as you go on a mighty quest\" kind of RPG game, it is a rougue-like. You will learn as you die. You have one life (or multiple on Adventure mode) and will thus have to be tactical and smart with the decisions you make.\n\nNow, getting with the review, this is a fantastic game that i highly recommend you try if you are a ROGUE-LIKE fan, not a traditional RPG fan. The game doesn't bring miscellaneous lose conditions to discourage and hinder you like other games in the genre (Damn hunger meters). This is not to say that the game is a cakewalk, rather it is far from it. The game expects you to die and to learn from it, take the time to analyze why you took 30% of your health in one shot, check the game log, inspect enemy monsters before you rush in so you can take them on effectively.\n\nThe game has excellent replayability, due to the diversity of races and classes as well as random dungeons and alternate layouts. Different races and classes also start in different areas and have slightly differing dungeons available, allowing for even more content that you may have not known was there in the first place. This, along with random loot that can have a wide variety of effects leads to the player enjoying exploring the world and tackling rare monsters.\n\nEven more content can be unlocked with the Arena and Infinite modes that can be obtained once you get to a certain point in the Campaign (both are fairly early). Arena mode lets you pick a race and class and lets you test your skill against a 30 or 60 wave gauntlet. Infinite places you in an infinite dungeon where you explore and try to survive for as long as you can.\n\nOverall, this game is a fun challenge for anyone who has the patience to see when to run and when to fight as well as the ability to say \"I just spent 10 hours on a character and he/she died. That's fine, let's see where we went wrong and try again.\" And for those who read the negative reviews and saw \"i ran into a wall of lvl 20 guys at lvl 1, game is unbalaced\", they ran into a event (which you can avoid and come back to later) where you open a locked door and fight high leveled enemies for better loot. It's a high risk high reward area, and if you don't think you can do it, don't.\n\nTLDR: If you have the patience to realise you made a mistake and analyze it, and you enjoy rougue-likes, this is a good game. You will die, a lot. This is part of the game. It is wonderful and has replayability like no other. Also, don't open sealed doors unless you are ready to fight high level guys who will kill you if you don't know what you're doing.", "timestamp_created": 1446240115, "timestamp_updated": 1479959679, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500519", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18765395": {"recommendationid": "18765395", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027444680", "num_games_owned": 99, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 5307, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500143233}, "language": "english", "review": "9/10 Awesome game!", "timestamp_created": 1446213532, "timestamp_updated": 1446213532, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18749849": {"recommendationid": "18749849", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047891559", "num_games_owned": 225, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5542, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512253805}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is a paragon of the rouguelike RPG genre.

The popular user-defined steam tags for this game are 100% spot on.\n\nDon't let the game title or graphics put you off. I think the title is too silly for a game this good.\n\nDon't listen to people who say this game is too hard -- there's multiple difficulty levels and modes -- one of the modes makes it just like Diablo 1 in terms of difficulty (exploration mode).\n\n\nExploration mode -- there's no fail state (think of the Diablo series).  It literally can't be too hard in this mode.\nAdventure mode  -- The perfect compromise.  You start with one life, and get a handful more as you level.  Death still sucks, but it's not too bad.  When you die, the game is telling you to Get Good -- It's not just because you didn't pray to RNGesus enough.  I think the game is balance tuned to this mode for normal human beings.\nRoguelike -- One life.  It's Ironman mode in a game balanced for multiple lives -- without the ability to grind in increase survivability (think Diablo).  So, you need a _very deep_ understanding of the game mechanics to succeed in this mode.  Like, looking at the code deep -- or at least benefiting from the knowledge of others who have, in some way.  Not that the game is totally unfair.  It's pretty damn fair.  But there are things in this game that will most likely result in your death if you're unprepared, and there's no way to know to prepare for them without having encountered it before.  In many cases, you do get very good hints about this through the ingame Lore/Story bits you find -- but not always.  That's my impression, anyways.  \n\nThe above modes are on top of additional difficulty settings, so it's rather fine-tunable (I started playing on Normal-Adventurer, and I'm still playing in that mode at 100 hours /played -- and I haven't beaten the game yet).\n\n\nHigh points as I think of them:\n\nGameplay is amazing.  \nItemization is top-notch.  \nClass ability balance is pretty damn good -- most games I feel like I'm beta testing class balance, but not here.\nThere's an actual story, and there are immersive pieces of lore that you find that are well-written.\nExtremely moddable, but not in a \"bad\" way like some games where you'd need to spend 100's of hours modding before you start playing (I'm looking at you, Fallout 3 and Skyrim.  Morrowind would be in the same boat, but it gets a pass from me because that game has style).\nLoving the Z key.\nEscort missions are brilliant.\nThe Devs removed the grind for consumables -- which is one of the major departures from classic rogue games.\nThe Rogue class is fun as hell for me.\nYou can tell that the Devs are true gamers -- what is optimal is also often enough the most fun way to play.  I get the impression that this is not merely serendipitous.\nAfter/If you beat the game, you can take your character into a true infinite dungeon to see how far you get.  That sounds pretty awesome, even though I haven't done it yet.\nHelpful ingame chat (you can link items into it, and there's an ingame browser).\n\nThe only downside is the graphics.  They could be better, and with how moddable the game is, I'm actually pretty surprised it's not already.  There's a certain amount of charm to them, but it's not like Fallout 1 level charm -- but then again the only game that comes close to that (or exceeds in some aspects) is Diablo 2, so I'm being a bit unfair.  There is a DLC for like $1 that does improve the UI graphics some, and I think it's worth getting.\n\nI could improve the graphics substantially and release it as a mod, but I'm too busy playing -- it's that good.  Mayber everyone feels the same way.\n\nGet this game because it's great.  \nGet the DLCs to support the Devs\n\nI'd rate this 9.9/10 if the price was irrelevant.  At its current price, it's an honest 11/10 ((before you say anything: YES I know).\n\n\nTLDR: It's great.  This game deserves to be more popular than it already is.

Watch your hero grow to be the ultimate awesomeness is a great pleasure for me.\nCombat in this game is the best I've seen in all games, the more skilled you are, the more fun you'll get(in higher difficulties of course). In many games, when you achieve \"mastery\" everything just becomes a cakewalk. This is never the case in TOME4. You get cocky and you die. \n\nTOME4 is so focus on combat that it DOES NOT have many traditional RPG/roguelike elements such as hunger, tireness, thirst, consumables... You can actually feel that every mechanism in it is born for battle(except some aesthetics options). This is good for TOME4 because adding these will only undermine what TOME4 already have.\n(Unrelated: Non-combat focused roguelikes can be really good as well, have you tried elona? If you ignore the male chauvinism filled in that game, it is magnificent.)\n\n[h1]Constantly updating[/h1]\nIt has an ancient history(In the field of computer games) and it is still updating. Major, huge updates including new classes/races/skills/graphics/mechanisms. \n\n[h1]Online features(can be disabled)[/h1]\nIt offers in-game chat with other players. if you visit the main website you can also check your many characters' details. You can discard them all if you don't want them and that will not affect your gameplay in any way, the only problem is that you won't be able to exchange items stored online between your characters.\n\n[h1]Friendly to beginners[/h1]\nIt offers a good tutorial and most of the stuff stay locked until you progress. You won't be overwhelmed by information if you are not prepared. \n\n[h1]Active player community[/h1]\nThe forum and wiki are quite useful and TOME4 have tons of mods developed by the players. You can get them easily in the workshops.\n\n[h1]Darkgod is Smart[/h1]\nThe developer of this game, Darkgod, is extremely smart. The game mechanisms are so well developed that there's no grinding/taking advantage of AI/boredem in late game.

Also has modding support.

This game and genre isn't for everybody and you know it.  Personally, I was just looking for a low graphics game to have for play on my laptop... only to find myself putting in tens of hours on my desktop as well.\n\nMy first roguelike was Dungeons of Dredmor, which was fun, but in terms of gameplay options and experimentation, it just wasn't enough.  This game is more than enough.  There are 26 classes in this game, most of which have unique playstyles and minimal overlap.  Between those, there are many ways to build most of them with endless opportunities to experiment and die horribly in different ways.  The UI is confusing at first, but very functional once you get the hang of it.  There is a significant mod community for those who are into that.\n\nThe game comes with most of the classes and some races unlocked.  This is somewhat controversial but for me was highly beneficial for my enjoyment of the game.  Making the classes unlockable makes the game much less overwhelming to pick up and provides a significant sense of progression even when your character fails to win the game.  Once those classes are unlocked, higher difficulty options and mods continue to extend the game's life.\n\nHealing potions and most consumables are replaced by cooldown-based \"Inscriptions\" and \"Runes,\" which is perfect because it removes any sort of \"saving for a rainy day\" hesitation players tend to have in combat.\n\nThere are a couple of issues with this game.  Some rigs may encounter excessive memory leaks with the default graphics settings.  Graphics and sound are expected to be minimal but there are a few obnoxious sound effects and themes in the game and some volume imbalance.  As commonly seen in these games, early level progression with many classes at higher difficulties is extremely frustrating.  But these issues are minor.

Because of the wide variety of abilities, status effects, and damage types, it is very difficult to build a character that can effectively defend against being one-shotted.  It's not fun to see a boss and instantly die.  There are also far too many ways to be stunlocked.\n- There's no way to grind experience or equipment.  There is a fixed amount in the world and you get what you get.  Resistances are key and largely only come from equipment.  Gold is very limited, so despite the plethora of shops it is very rare to be able to afford anything useful.\n- Some of the class mechanics are very complex and not well explained.  Or explained at all.  I'm looking at you, chronomancer.\n- Some classes are very equipment-dependent, which means if you don't get the right artifact drops you cannot play effectively.\n- The game is easy for the first couple hours and then it suddenly spikes towards the end of the second tier of dungeons.

TOME streamlines some things while keeping true to the formula of old school games like Nethack, ADOM, and Brogue. There's a free version that's basically the same as the paid version - you can download it from the TOME website if you're not sure you want to buy this yet.\n\nTOME has automatic identification. You also get an item called a transmogrification chest, which basically cashes out your loot while you're still in the dungeon - reducing the risk of overencumbrance or loot saturation. TOME also has a modern engine and tileset, although the tileset is rather ugly. Most importantly for new players, there are five difficulty settings and three permadeath settings. The permadeath settings are especially useful, because they provide the option to 1) explore with unlimited lives, 2) play the game as intended, but with limited lives, and 3) play with permadeath like a true roguelike.\n\nWhile it has convenience features, TOME is still an old school roguelike. Beating it without spoilers is a large undertaking, although not as difficult as Nethack. The different dungeons/areas are all different types of difficulty and as a level one character you might wander into a powerful monster's lair and get immediately annihilated. This is the kind of game where you'll need a wiki open most of the time if you're not a masochist.\n\nTOME is also very feature-complete. Not only is there a standard story/open-world mode, but there is also an arena and endless dungeon. The Steam Workshop opens up modding opportunities. There is a huge amount of lore (my estimate so far is at least the length of a full book). There are lots of classes, many of which only become avaiable to you once you've reached a certain point in the game, which ensures there's always something fresh. It has over a thousand achievements, which is the highest out of any game on Steam (when it first came out Steam couldn't even handle it, the devs had to work with Valve for a few weeks to get them working properly).\n\nOne thing that really spices up the game for me is the ability to play as anti-magic. There's a faction in the world of TOME that is violently opposed to arcane magic. You can join them as long as you don't use any arcane magical items or cast spells. It's not as much of a challenge as it seems because there are non-arcane \"natural\" enchantments too, so anti-magic is a valid choice for story, roleplaying, or gameplay variation. It makes melee classes quite a bit more interesting and immersive.\n\nI highly recommend Tales of Maj'Eyal for people who are interested in getting into classic roguelikes, or old roguelike fans who want to play something newer.", "timestamp_created": 1437496120, "timestamp_updated": 1437496120, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.676321", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17078864": {"recommendationid": "17078864", "author": {"steamid": "76561197976012551", "num_games_owned": 399, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 27383, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497481586}, "language": "english", "review": "Look at it! Isn't it ugly and repulsive?\nWell, this game is a prime example of looks not having to tell anything about the value of a game.\nTales of Maj'Eyal (ToME) is a turn based RPG with many roguelike features. Overall, the story isn't relevant (although there is a lot of lore to read). It rather concentrates on fighting, looting, and leveling.\nInstead of writing an in-depth review here are the apects that I like the most about it:\n\n[b]Classes[/b]\nToME has a whole lot of classes to offer. Sure, there are the archetypes like Warrior or Archer. However, you will also find many crazy and interesting classes. Examples for this are the Paradox Mage who controls time, the Oozemancer who draws his powers from oozes and slime, and the Wyrmic who uses the powers of the dragons.\n\n[b]No One-Trick Ponies[/b]\nMost skills (called \"Talents\") in the game have cooldowns. IMO this is great because it makes concentrating on one or a couple of talents an irrelevant strategy. Just the amount of talents in the game is staggering. In addition, many talents of a class allow for synergies. Also, you have to be well prepared for a number of different situations.\nThe cooldowns make combat so much more interesting. It is always a good idea to carefully consider using which talent in which situation. Just nuked a standard enemy with your most powerful spell? Well, you won't have it available for the next 20 turns.\n\n[b]Special Enemies[/b]\nSome enemies can have the talents of one (or even multiple!) of the classes available to the player. This will put you repeatedly in extremely dangerous but also very interesting situations.\n\n[b]Loot[/b]\nThe game offers tons of randomly generated loot. The items can vary in their stats heavily and may change your playstyle a lot.

Much Strats, Little Mercy. Victory Sweet.\n\nTales of Maj'Eyal. -sigh- I said I would write a review for this game when I beat it. Well I just edged over six hundred hours and finally have won. There really isn't much more to cover. The tags show it's a rogue-like, the videos give you a solid understanding of what to expect, and the user base has voted it overwhelmingly positive. So instead, I'm going to explain the emotional aspects of the game.  TOME (Tales of Maj'Eyal) will make you feel dead inside. I've litteraly taken a skirmisher over the course of thirty hours into the second to the last room and died. Boom, save deleted. Can you handle that? I couldn't, that was around hour mark 400. I couldn't sleep, I'm not kidding, when you die TOME plays this little dun dun dunn tone. I had no idea I was about to die, the moment the screen flicked red and that tune played, well, I broke out into a sweat. My friend was over visiting from the other side of the state and that is the only reason I didn't freak out into a felonious rage. Now you gotta understand, that was one death of many. Your victories are few and far between in TOME, you refight the same bosses over and over and over, it doesn't matter how much content there is in the game, you will feel almost no reward for killing alt minotaur for the hundreath time. You'll rage through the sandworms annoyed that you have to think with every move rather than autopiloting. When you're sucked into the fearscape with a fire specd character you'll understand fear and if you get out alive you just return to the motions. After hundreds of hours of hundreds of deaths you finally get to the last boss. Then you win. I've been smiling for two days now, I think on winning and just grin. I can't help it. It's probably the most rewarding victory I've ever had in a game. Puts emerald or ruby weapon to shame. Six hundred hours for this feeling. Then you take it off normal mode and switch to nightmare difficulty and die in the starting area. So basically what I'm saying is, how well do you know yourself? Is this a goal worth your time? It was for me.\n\nSome Quick Notes for Noobs:\nZ: This hotkey will rest your character and autoexplore. Use at your own risk.\nP: This pulls up all the talent trees so you can plan for the future.\nI: Inventory, big suprise.\nF1 and F2: These toggle between the golem and the alchemist if you play that class.\nCaps Lock: This enables free viewing on the map so you can arrow key around.\nTab: Blows up the map so you can see it better, enemies you know of will be marked on it.\nOptions Menu: In this menu you can turn off the autopick tool for your skill and stat points at creation.\n", "timestamp_created": 1435210913, "timestamp_updated": 1435210913, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.524220", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16690482": {"recommendationid": "16690482", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967608630", "num_games_owned": 431, "num_reviews": 61, "playtime_forever": 17, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1435204208}, "language": "english", "review": "Despite my Steam time in the game I have put in hours into this game prior to purchasing it here.

With the expansions it has two story campaigns to go through, an infinite dungeon and a wave fighting arena mode. The main campaign has tens of zones (and random generated zones using the farportal) and Embers of Rage featuring over 20 zones as well.\nWith 14 races and over 30 classes each featuring their own talent categories (some can share some categories with other classes) there's an insane amount of replayability as you try different class/race combinations and master their playstyles. Granted a lot of them have to be unlocked by doing different objectives in game, if you're not into that theres a mod that lets you unlock all of them.\nMain reason why ToME is THE roguelike to play is the nature of it's combat. As you play you will gather abilities from talents and items, some of them having multiple uses (like Rush being good for: attacking, repositioning and escaping). Enemies also use the same abilities depending on their class and by inspecting them you can learn how to deal with different enemies as different classes.

One day I had the bright idea to get a roguelike, since I could hotspot my phones data service to download something rather small that would DL quickly. I got a bunch of roguelikes and I like to think it spawned my eternal love for them during those two years.\n\n Anyway, ToME was one of those roguelikes, and I SWEAR TO YOU I played it almost every single day for hours on end. It is an INCREDIBLY fun and addicting experience. As an avid roguelike player the graphics mean virtually nothing to me, being used to ASCII and barely perceptible tile sets. I still praise the games artwork and aesthetic design highly though. It is so simply rendered yet beautiful in its approach. The gameplay is amazing, turn based, plenty of abilites, plenty of choices, plenty of different ways to build different characters, plenty of differenct races, plenty of different classes. Plenty of everything. \n\nI just recently bought it on steam, along with the dlc, and god DAMN let me fucking tell you, the DLC is FUCKING FANTASTIC. In a game that already set a high bar on its self, the DLC pushes that bar and in some places even cracks it open. DarkGod has truly made an amazing game that, with time, I imagine most if not all people can get into, given its alternating difficulties and approach to the traditional roguelike challenges. \n\nAlso, for a roguelike, it is relatively newbie friendly.

You can go hardcore, 1-life Roguelike if you want.\n\nRaces/Classes - Several of them, unlockable. I'm still missing 5. They are very different from each other, with many different and interesting skill trees. You gotta put some thinking into figuring out what you are gonna make and how you are going to build it.\n\nItems - Diablo-like, random drops and attributes, different rarity and tier levels. You feel the thrill of finding good loot. Lots of uniques too. You can stash them and retrieve with another/new character, boosting them hard on your future playthroughs. Just 3 at a time tho, which is annoying, but you can re-do it as many times as you want and so distribute any number of items between your dudes.\n\nMap/Dungeons - Always the same dungeons, but spawning on random locations across the map and with randomized interiors. Some minor events and sub-dungeons are also randomly generated.\n\nQuests - Not a lot of them, always the same, but some are very interesting and give nice rewards.\n\nLore - LOTS of lore scrolls to be found, telling the game's universe story. I didn't read them, I never do, I don't have the patience, but if you like immersing yourself a bit deeper, you won't have a problem with that.\n\nElite/Rare/Unique/Boss Monsters - These are the ones who usually take those 7 lives away from you... along with the rare multihued wyrms... and magic wielders... and map encounters...  and everything else if you are a Mage.\n\nGameplay - You gotta build your character right, position yourself right, pay attention, have an escape plan... some parts are really though until you get a good hang of the game-- which is great, and a good part of the fun.\n\nGraphics/Sound - They work perfectly, the visual effects are nice and the music is pretty good.\n\nBugs/Crashes - I got 3 in 63 hours. Fixed a \"0 turn duration skill\" by going back to the main menu and then continuing the game, fixed both crashes by clicking \"Close\" on the in-game dump note. I had to kill one of my temporal hounds on the second one though, otherwise the dumps kept coming, but it was easily fixed.\n\nThis is a great game, awesome cost/benefit. I'm usually skeptical about old-school graphics, but they don't take anything away from ToME, and this baby does very well what most modern games screw up - the part that really matters.\n\nAnd now... I'm going Paladin next. To see if I can get that holy gentleman past the freaking Master... \n\nEDIT:\n\nMy paladin died on the last boss fight. I'm still mourning him... or rather all the items he took along to his grave. I hope he is in hell... forever...\n\nDoombringer, the DLC class, is awesome.\n\nI also found out I'm not man enough to face the Atamathon.\n\nOn the downside, Temporal Hounds always end up glitching somehow (and Time Warden is the s**t, my best dude). I had to edit and repack some of the game's files to fix one of them. It worked, but required some effort. And now, doing the Prides on Nightmare with that very same TW, the game began freezing hard, forcing me to reopen it to keep going every 20 minutes or so.\n\nSo... avoid Temporal Hounds if you can. I can't, I like puppies. On the other hand, I didn't have any problems whatsoever with the other classes... my summoner (who spawned a lot more stuff than 3 dogs) worked fine until he got raped by The Master.", "timestamp_created": 1434889816, "timestamp_updated": 1488034314, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 32, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.704527", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16581258": {"recommendationid": "16581258", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026106411", "num_games_owned": 223, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 8433, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502605773}, "language": "hungarian", "review": "Among the best rogue-likes I have encountered, highly recommended - a compulsory investment for any rogue-like fans.", "timestamp_created": 1434888630, "timestamp_updated": 1434888630, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16577303": {"recommendationid": "16577303", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010883617", "num_games_owned": 259, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2125, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490996599}, "language": "english", "review": "Lovely Rougelike - hard as nails and addictive!\nTry the harder difficulties ;)", "timestamp_created": 1434877446, "timestamp_updated": 1434877446, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16568835": {"recommendationid": "16568835", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972873719", "num_games_owned": 343, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 2485, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512255354}, "language": "english", "review": "Easily one of the best roguelikes I've ever played.

It has all the fun and challenge of a classic roguelike but updated with modern conveniences. Not to mention this game is just sopping wet with lore that, if you actually take the time to read through, is pretty damn interesting. In short, it's been an amazing experience so far. If you're a fan of the classics like ADOM then I couldn't recommend this enough.\n\nOne of the things I absolutely adore about this game is all the unlockables. In a genre in which you can die fairly quickly or lose hours of progress over one stupid mistake, you need good amounts of replay value to keep you rolling characters. This game does that pretty well with tons of unlockables. You not only have races, classes and talent trees to unlock, but also prodigy unlocks that'll give every character you roll items like the transmogrification box which automatically picks up junk items and turns them into gold. \n\nThere's a fairly good variety of dungeons in this game. Not only in style and layout but in the ways you can go about progressing in them. I found myself in a cave with no hallways filled with passive worms that chewed up sections of the wall. In order to go to the next room you needed to follow one of these worms and if you stuck around in one of its tunnels for too long it could collapse on you. Made for a really intense boss fight at the end. Not to mention each dungeon is filled to burst with it's own lore which is definitely a plus. A lot of them have little challenges too in the form of rooms behind stuck doors. If you choose to open these doors you're usually faced with tough monsters and traps, but also some pretty fancy loot. It's completely optional so if you're struggling to get through a dungeon then it's just not worth it.\n\nIn the time I've been playing I haven't been able to find a whole lotta quests. It seems like half the people you talk to early-game are all looking for potion ingredients but the rest were actually pretty interesting. I found a secret door in the overworld that took me to a rogue's den where they captured a merchant. You have the choice of joining the rogues or freeing the merchant which unlocks a rare items shop in one of the towns. Later-game quests get more interesting as well.\n\nTeaching someone how to play your game is very important. It's something I think about every time I play a game and it can ultimately ruin a player's experience early on if they have no idea what they're doing. Now this is especially difficult with games like this that are filled with content and complexity. The solution? Unlockables. This game gives you the basics of each different type of class to start off with. This keeps the player from being overwhelmed with options at the beginning or the advanced know-how to play the more strategic classes. It also gives the player a goal early on to keep them playing. I had no trouble at all learning how to play this game. If you're new to roguelikes then I don't think you'd have troubles either.\n\nI think my only real gripe with this game is the random escort missions you get on some dungeon floors. They're great in that if you do manage to escort them to their portal, you get a pretty decent reward. However, their ai is absolutely ridiculous. They tend to blindly trudge slowly towards their portal and tend to get themselves trapped between monsters or just refuse to run away from some of them which is double bad if you're a ranged class. There's a mod in the workshop that helps with this problem but the problem's still kinda there, you're just able to make them wait in one spot for x amount of turns.\n\nAll in all, this game is fantastic. The amount of content you get in this game is astounding, too. Even it's DLC is soaked in content. Not to mention the price is pretty damn reasonable. If you're into roguelikes then there's no reason not to pick this up. If you're trying to get into roguelikes but are left feeling empty playing roguelike-likes or games that claim to have \"roguelike elements\" expecting to get that same rush playing NetHack then you owe it to yourself to play this game.

However I would like to see a further increase to charactor lore. Perhaps a combination of Elder scrolls daggerfalls history your charactor recieves with a bit of wizardry 8s charactor system. It should be noted that this game is certainly not for everyone. The niche people that it attracts however will find it extremly entertaining.", "timestamp_created": 1434539054, "timestamp_updated": 1434539054, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16457964": {"recommendationid": "16457964", "author": {"steamid": "76561197980099890", "num_games_owned": 112, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2355, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490305728}, "language": "english", "review": "nice looking like old rpg", "timestamp_created": 1434498050, "timestamp_updated": 1434498050, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16443820": {"recommendationid": "16443820", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031831810", "num_games_owned": 89, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 17533, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506625775}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "[h1]Classes interessantes?

I've put hundreds of hours into this game (not on the Steam version) and still pop back in every once in a while when I want to experience a true roguelike game. I would highly recommend this as a gateway drug into the realm of roguelikes for any newcomers to the genre. It's got a very easy to use GUI (no need for all the crazy keyboard commands), a talent tree which many gamers are used to seeing when developing characters, and a tileset, for those that can't read ASCII. \n\nWhile I haven't played it as much, some of the common complaints are that the early game feels a bit grindy. The lack of a hunger clock sort of encourages visiting all early level dungeons, even if you can stomp over them. Some \"unfair\" deaths by some combinations of powers that some rares/uniques have. This can be especially frustrating, but TOME's adventure mode gives several lives (Gasp, the horror!), which does help to at least mitigate that frustration a bit.\n\nThe game is fairly lengthy, and the replayability of the game is amazing. Many of the classes have a very distinct feel to them, which makes it fun to experiment with various character builds. The most frustrating thing about this game is that it takes a while to build up a character the way you want it, and then a harsh combination of a boss can easily wipe it out if you are like me and refuse to skip places and come back to it later.\n\nOverall, a great game to try out and play. If you're on the fence about \"buying/donating\" to this game. You can play this game for free on te4.org. You will get access to nearly everything that a donator would so you really won't be missing much, but if you enjoy it, I recommend you toss some $$ towards the DarkGod since he's done an amazing thing with this game.", "timestamp_created": 1434394472, "timestamp_updated": 1434394472, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16424682": {"recommendationid": "16424682", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030887507", "num_games_owned": 498, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 5526, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1432759071}, "language": "english", "review": "Filled a void in me I didn't knew existed.", "timestamp_created": 1434394054, "timestamp_updated": 1434394054, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 25, "votes_funny": 13, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565599", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16423878": {"recommendationid": "16423878", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029937118", "num_games_owned": 285, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 1412, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1427580134}, "language": "english", "review": "Probably one of my top favorite roguelikes.\n\nThis game is not only extremely challenging, but is also insanely addictive and somehow keeps you coming back over and over to try out new classes and races.\n\nVery well designed even though it seems simple.

A lot of the classes have very unique design as well, offering synergies, combinations of effects and other things I have yet to see in other roguelikes.\n>Amazing web services, just check out a random profile: http://te4.org/users/kalmazaton\n>Fixed zone bosses and possible bosses, as well as randomized mini-bosses\n>A lot of room for challenge and exploration in general\n>Dev involvement. Our sexy overlord drops by in chat frequently, so do some people helping out with the programming. Occasionally they will launch in-game events that range from extra dungeons to unique/interesting buffs.\n>Awesome Steam Workshop add-on integration & content\n\nSome things that may be off-putting:\n>Learning curve - Even for people familiar with the genre, in the beginning you might encounter some bullshit moments or just have to look up the wiki for some things until you know better. The community can be reached ingame through a live chat and is very helpful, though.\n>Permanent unlocks. Personally, I love the idea of obtaining new, unique and game altering choices and builds by completing challenges, but some people just prefer to have all the options available from the get go. A remedy later in this review.\n>Grind. The grind is not bad, but you can make it bad by failure. If you man-tain a beard and have balls to show for, you will stick to Permadeath (Roguelike) mode, and especially in the beginning where you are getting a feeling for everything - enemies in general, boss strategies, zone order with your preferred class etc. etc. - you will die often and may end up with the feeling that you have to redo the same few dungeons over and over again.\nPlease, if you feel like you're stuck like this, just ask the community, or consult the wiki and look up some unlockables to keep you motivated and approach things from a different perspective.\n\n***\n\nThings to note:\n\nThe game is free. Why buy it then?\nSimple: Donor status.

It adds so much more content, including two awesome classes, and the pack is on a sale right now anyway.\n\nGet some add-ons!\nI recommend these Quality of Life mods:\n'Purists' Breeding Pits Restoration Project - Dev got pressured to censor one area by SJWs, this undoes the censorship\nNPC Forgiveness - Has NPCs forgive you after some time if you accidentally hit them with an AoE\nEscorts Enhanced - Makes those random escort NPCs less of a PITA; You can now ask them where their exit point is and they have a HP regen now\n\nThen another one for pansies: Whatever this mod was called that lets you pick all the races/classes etc. even if you don't have them unlocked.\n\nGO BUY THIS, MAGGOTS", "timestamp_created": 1434390707, "timestamp_updated": 1434390917, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.979740", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16422995": {"recommendationid": "16422995", "author": {"steamid": "76561198110856247", "num_games_owned": 270, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 5665, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489714765}, "language": "english", "review": "(In future may write a longer review, but as it is on sale right now, here is my recommendation in short form)\n\nTales of Maj'Eyal (ToME) is extremely good at what it is- a roguelike of the dungeoncrawler RPG type, that can also be played as a more regular RPG with limited or infinite lives.

And yet it's a great introduction to the roguelike genre, because there are options to play it with a number of lives, or even unlimited ones, to get the hang of the game! Not EVERYTHING is randomized (there are fixed artifacts, fixed locations, etc but it still feels like a roguelike). Also, it contains intuitive UI and gameplay. For example, there are practically no consumables like potions and scrolls - not in the sense we're accostumed to. Instead, your powers (and some items) have cooldowns along with, naturally, some resource management (stamina, mana, psi, etc.). Cast X spell/move? Wait Z turns to use it again. Or, maybe, use some talent that can reset some cooldowns ;-). That cooldown system is really intuitive and just one of the many reasons I'm in love with ToME.\n\nNow let's talk about the world. I'm not an old ToME follower but unless I'm mistaken, it used to be set in Tolkien's Middle-Earth, until it was changed to a more original lore. And it's a great lore: the continent of Eyal was, some time ago, devastated by catatrophic used of magic (i.e the Spellblaze), there are still mage hunters (Zigur), there are political issues (Halflings are militaristic and even used to slave Yeeks); heck, even the demons have a touching and fantastic backstory! So, in terms of lore, the game has good stuff to offer. Some of the actual places are very creative, too: tunnels of sand that can collapse and swallow the uncautious adventurer, underwater ruins, necromancer dens, forests, deserts, and so on...\n\nIn terms of races/classes, there are 11 races and 26 classes, allowing for tons of builds. There are your classic warriors (Bulwark, Berserker), mages (Archmage, Necromancer) and even exotic classes that can manipulate things like their foes' dreams (Solipsist), draconic powers (Wyrmic) and even time itself (Temporal Warden, Paradox Mage)! Most of the races and classes are unlocked as you progress in the game and do certain tasks, which aren't too hard, honestly. But if you're impatient, then you can look for an addon (mod) that unlocks everything right out of the bat. ;-)\n\nAnyway, it's getting too long. I typed all of that to convice you to PLAY THE GAME. Seriously, play it.

The world of Maj'Eyal has some pretty cool lore, which is good because there are huge piles of it.\n\nIf you play this game, start on Adventurer mode. You get an extra life at set levels, and until you have a really good grasp on the game, playing on Roguelike (ie one death and you're done) is an exercise in frustration. Until very recently, I refused to play on anything other than the one-life setting. This was a mistake.

Most of them feel like one long dungeon run. Some of them have a sort of level select (crypt of the necrodancer) or progress through different levels (rogues legacy/binding of isaac).\n\nBut none of them had the feeling like you were an adventurer, going on YOUR OWN adventure. They kind of drop you in a dungeon and say \"have fun, here's your dungeon\".\n\nBut in TOME (tales of maj'eyal) you got an overworld map. You can go to really difficult areas or fight random adventurers who just roam around. There's towns you can visit and tons of shops.\n\nIt's very immersive, especially for a roguelike. It makes me want to play some pen and paper D&D again.\n\nAnd there's a ton of skills and items you can get. And lots of random events. Many random bosses / minibosses who will destroy you. There's just a TON of content. It's not difficult to get into, although discerning what loot is useful or not is definitely beyond casual.\n\nYou can chat with other players, which even in a single player game can add a lot. You can see when people die, which even if you aren't talking to them, is interesting to watch.\n\nAnd my personal favorite feature is that you can have multiple lives. It's not a great feature in the spirit of roguelikes, but in the spirit of gaming it's fantastic. This is usually an instant \"omg this game sucks and isn't a roguelike\". But I love everything about these type of RPGs, EXCEPT for the permadeath.\n\nFor some reason, finding a mix of roguelike aspects in a non-roguelike RPG is impossible. That is, things like traps, random events, deep character customizations, random/persistent effects, and just general \"I have no idea what this will do, but I'll try it\".

All too often, they throw a million different obtuse mechanics at you, including but not limited to hunger (discouraging exploration), unidentified items (discouraging the collection of loot, which serves as a major incentive to crawl a dungeon to begin with), or cursed items (discouraging the use of higher quality gear because you'll never be able to unequip it, or equipping it literally kills you)\n\nDarkGod (the developer of the game) decided to try something different, here. Understanding that mechanics like cursed items and hunger are relics of the past, he did away with them. This entire game, conceptually speaking, takes a good, hard look at what makes other roguelikes unapproachable messes and tries to understand what the real meat of the genre is, and he has spent years polishing his vision to a fine shine.\n\n DarkGod has given you a a huge variety of archtypes, each with their own subclasses that specialize in one thing or another. Simple \"bump\" based combat that dominates other games in the genre has been replaced with a rich skill system that encourages you to carefully consider not only the positions of yourself and your enemies, but what skills to use in order to ensure your survival. Rather than relying on hard to find or expensive to purchase consumable items, you will find \"runes\" and \"inscriptions\" that are infinitely re-usable, but come with a cooldown, demanding that you make strategic use of them. The skill tree system forces you to make careful decisions in regards to pumping skills that make it easier to not die, or pumping skills that make it easier for you to kill enemies, which is itself another valid form of survival. Many skills combo together in ways that you can't easily imagine, which, if you slow down and take enough time to think it through, a situation which appears hopeless at first glance can be turned around through sheer determination and enough tactical thought.\n\nI will readily admit that I am not well versed enough in the genre to elaborate any further on what this game does better than its competitors. But I do know that I have avoided playing roguelikes for years because of obtuse mechanics, and this game did away with enough of them to captivate me for dozens of hours already, and will almost certainly rob me of even more of my time as the days go on.

This game is for any old school RPG'er that misses great mechanics and gameplay.  I cannot stress enough how engaging this game is.  Anyway, I will list some of the goods and bads of the game.\n\n[h1][u]The Good[/u][/h1]\n\n[list]\n[*] The developer, DarkGod, is very attentive to the boards and genuinely is interested in his customers.  This is a positive that is almost nonexistent is most software. (Especially indy stuff.)\n[*] The choice of characters/classes is vast.  Yes, you have to play to unlock all of them.  That is part of the fun.\n[*] Character development is very customizable and detailed.  For me this is a plus, for some this is the source of extreme confusion.\n[*] The UI is very friendly.  Although, like a lot of the game, it does have a somewhat inclined learning curve.  I have been playing for 60 odd hours and I am still finding ways to use it and new things I didn't know it could do with it.\n[*] The workshop support is tremendous.  You can customize this game to suit your needs.\n[*] This is a Rogue Like game that has difficulty settings from casual to hard core.  If you want, you CAN play with unlimited lives.  Or, if you fancy a good challenge, you can play 1 life on crazy difficulty.  The choice is yours.  (I read a few reviews complaining that they died too quick.  So set it on easy and learn to play; it is that simple.)\n[*] Tremendous amount of trophies.  One ninth of them are very gettable for anyone. (The trophes are copied nine times for different levels of play.  And, yes, if you do higher level trophies they will get all the same trophies below them.  You just have to do a little dance to have it happen.  If an old fart like me can figure it out (I read posts) then I imagine most people can do the same.)\n[*] The story is not bad at all.  Far more engaging than most much more expensive games.  If you think it is boring and unimaginative you probably haven't actually read and/or played through much of it.\n[/list]\n\n[h1][u]The Bad[/u][/h1]\n\n[*] No, this game is not perfect.  The biggest drawback, from some people's view, is the graphics.  They are very yesterday, yesteryear, last decade possibly.  (For me this is not that big of a deal, I will gladly trade eye-candy for good gameplay.)\n[*] I have experienced some game lag in different parts of the game.  Not sure what causes them, but they are surely there.  I have never had it crash, but I have had to wait 30-90 seconds for it to come out of an apparent mini-freeze.\n[*] This game can be unflinchingly mean and nasty at higher levels.  For some this is a deal breaker.  For me it is a lot of fun.  So do with that what you want.  (I have read many blog/posts about people rage quitting and never playing again.  For those people...never play Magic the Gathering, you will end up hating life and your friends.)\n[*] The UI is very friendly.  Although, like a lot of the game, it does have a somewhat [b][u]inclined learning curve.[/u][/b]  Yes, I know this was listed in my \"Goods,\" but it is most definitely a negative for a lot of people.\n[*] Kind of gets in the way of life if you get into it.  It is a \"just one more turn/zone/thingy type game that will overtake your life if you let it.\n[/list]\n\nThat is all that I can think of off the top of my head.  I have an old head.  (And, most of the other parts as well.)  So, in closing, get the game.  It is too cheap and well made to not have it in your library.  If this is formatted incorrectly, I humbly apologize for my oldness and lack of modern techno-goodness; it has been years since I \"formatted\" anything and I imagine quite rusty.\n\n[h1][b]***Sits back and waits to get troll-fired***[/b][/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1430446015, "timestamp_updated": 1430446448, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 207, "votes_funny": 26, "weighted_vote_score": "0.914144", "comment_count": "19", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15617557": {"recommendationid": "15617557", "author": {"steamid": "76561198158938940", "num_games_owned": 793, "num_reviews": 136, "playtime_forever": 1000, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1465313383}, "language": "english", "review": "This exactly the kind of rogue-like game I've been looking for a while.

I mean its not super hd high quality but i personally like it a lot.\nBut of course you dont get games like this for the graphics but for the gameplay.\n\nGameplay: holy shit its a lot. You start with a few races and classes to choose from but as you go further in the main story you unlock more stuff. There are 3 game modes.\n\n1. story mode: its a story mode. You start at a starting place (which is different for some classes and races) and go through a adventure. you unlock a lot of things by just playing. You can play this on different difficulties and modes. Roguelike with 1 life, Adventure where you unlock some extra lifes as you level a bit and exploration where you have infinite lives.\n\n2. Arena: you unlock this by doing a quest quite early in the game, you are in a arena with whatever race/class you chose and you battle against a wave of enemies to become a champion.\n\n3. Endless dungeon: also a game mode you need to unlock in story mode. Well what is more to say you got endless floors and keep going further and further down. You can break the level cap with this i think and go higher than 50.\n\nStory/Lore: I love the lore the most. It feels like such a deep world with all the information you get about people and the history i think its amazing.\n\nI also would like to tell you i havent even touched the surface of this game got around 30 hours now and there is still so much to do.

There's a lot of strategy and depth in the class talents and other levelling decisions.

Later, I discovered ADOM, and Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup.  It took me a while to warm up to Angband and its variants, cause I was used to \"Hacklikes\", which are fundamentally pretty different games.  I'll be using the terminology \"*Bands\" to refer to the latter, the * meaning put whatever you like there.  Games like Angband, Zangband, Cthangband, Animeband, Hengband, etc.  I'm going to do some comparing, because in order to understand why you should play ToME, some history and context is useful.  You've gotta know what you're getting into, here.\n\nComparing Hacklikes to *Bands is a lot like comparing X-Wing Vs. Tie Fighter to X3.  Roguelikes aren't generally \"fast-paced\" (with the exception of some wonderful titles like Crypt of the Necrodancer), but when I say that Hacklikes are faster than *Bands, what I mean is the planned length of a successful game is much shorter.  You can beat Nethack in a determined afternoon if you know exactly what you're doing and get a bit lucky.  *Bands are designed to be played for hundreds of hours before completion.  This distinction wasn't apparent to me until I got a bit older and explored the *Bands more thoroughly, because at first I just found them boring and samey.\n\nTales of Maj'Eyal (and how do you even say that out loud?) is, historically and in spirit, a *Band game.  It used to be called Tales of Middle Earth, and was based on a game called UMoria, which is in turn an Angband variant.  For ToME 4, they discarded the Tolkein and created all new lore from scratch, and changed a LOT of features.  This is largely the ToME that you'll be playing if you buy this game.\n\nSo, what characterizes a *Band, and ToME in particular?  What kind of games are these?\n\nWhereas in Hacklikes, you are pressed forward by limited resources and infinitely spawning monsters, in a *Band, the game flow is based around infinite resources.  Take food, for example.  In most if not all Hacklikes, your character becomes hungry over time at a pretty good clip, and you have to find food or you will die.  So, much of the early game becomes about knowing which monster corpses are safe or even beneficial to eat, as well as locating non-perishable foods such as rations (which are in turn quite heavy in bulk, necessitating inventory management of very limited space).\n\nIn *Bands, you also get hungry, but the rate at which you do is very very slow compared to Hacklikes.  Monsters generally don't leave corpses, and you can always buy rations in town, which you can always get back to easily with a scroll of recall.  Hacklikes generally have no such spells or scrolls (if they have towns at all), and shop inventory is very limited and, depending on the game, usually does not restock.\n\nHunger is, however, a mechanic that later on becomes almost a non-issue in winning Hacklike runs.  There exist items that can slow digestion or produce infinite or near-infinite food in most all Hacklikes, such that the hunger mechanic mostly kills off early characters or very unlucky midrange characters.  And in *Bands, I'm a relative noob, but I've still never lost a character due to hunger.\n\nSo, why even have a hunger mechanic, then?  The developer of ToME probably asked himself that very question, and did away with hunger for ToME 4.  This is only one of many smoothed out, streamlined mechanics that fully embrace the *Band / infinite resources heritage of ToME and make it more accessible for newcomers.  There are also no unidentified items, for instance, and the game offers you an \"adventure\" mode where you have more than one life, or an \"exploration\" mode that's unlocked and visible right from the start, with infinite lives.  Of course, I'm bullheaded and old-school, so I only play on \"roguelike\" mode, where dead is dead.  But you might find you have wiggle room in other modes to learn more per character.\n\nYou're still going to die a lot, especially if you play anything other than a Bulwark.  But the classes are very interesting, and the lore is very well-written and interesting.  You gradually unlock more birth options (for new characters) as you play and find certain sidequests, but nothing else is persistent between runs, unlike many of the rogue-lites and mystery dungeon type games that have been popular lately.  This is a very hardcore, old-school roguelike of the *Band lineage.  You'll be playing any particular character for a very long time, growing attached to them and overcoming many challenges before dying horribly 100 hours from now because you got stupid for a second.  And then you're going to start over, because it's insanely fun.\n\nAlchemists in particular are probably my favorite class so far: You get a golem that you can equip and that has laser eyes and charges into battle to take hits for you while you throw grenades from the back lines.  I like to name mine after my boyfriend.  Summoners are also a lot of fun: you can throw wolves at peoples' faces, and summon dragons and minotaurs to kill things while your turtle tanks for you.  But I really recommend playing Bulwark or maybe Berserker to start: they're much less flimsy (Bulwarks in particular, they're the sword/mace/axe and board characters) and will let you learn more and accomplish more birth unlocks per run.\n\nHealing is accomplished through cooldown abilities rather than limited items, and you have a lot of options for talent specs to build even a particular class in very different ways.  Different races have very useful and interesting bonuses and penalties and racial skills, and as a woman I appreciate that there's no in-game difference between playing female or male.  Roguelikes aren't the games to do gender political commentary, lol.\n\nSo, if you get ToME (and you absolutely should), you're basically getting what games like the Elder Scrolls series aspire in their most ambitious moments to be: a long-term playfield where you can go on adventures and explore dungeons and become strong from nothing.  Most modern crpgs try to achieve what roguelikes, and *Bands in particular, already had nailed a long time ago, and if you play this version of ToME, you're getting the best of any game I've seen so far in this already-amazing and venerable genre.\n\nOne last thing: this game includes a chat feature that lets you talk to other players as you play on a few different channels, and I highly recommend you use it and get to know some of the other people who know a lot about the game.  Your mileage may vary of course, but in my experience the community for this game is both dedicated and very welcoming and helpful.

A dwarf, sword and board warrior type. (There are a lot of race and class combinations) What I didn't like was the fact that after cutting my way through the first dungeon, I went out into the world and wandered into what must have been a higher level dungeon. The first monster I saw was level twenty and it beat the crap out of me and killed me so fast that I didn't have a chance to run away. Then, I go to sort of a Purgatory-like place, where this dude asks if I want to live or stay dead. I chose to live, so I respawn in the dungeon and get killed again. Okay, bad idea. So I go back to Purgatory and then I tell the dude, yeah I want to live but send me some place else. So, he does. Then, I run into an adventuring party which kills me for the third time.

Yes it is brutally hard, but the hotkeys weren't annoying to learn, mechanics aren't hard to pick up, I felt as if it was just a really easy game to physically play, even if I died non stop. It's like the perfect 'serious' roguelike for people new to the much more difficult titles in the genre; still hard and indepth, but much easier to play and get into. A game such as Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup is a similar title, that while could be considered arguably better, is much more difficult to get into, in my opinion.\n\nI recommend the adventure difficulty though, where you get lives at the start, there's a hell of a lot of content to experience in Tales of Maj'Eyal and playing with 1 life as a beginner, will usually get you murdered very fast.

While that depth is definitely part of Tales of Maj'Eyal, it's only very necessary for later levels when you're actually needing to manage every stat and balance everything to survive. That isn't to say the game is casual, as you can very easily die over, and over, and over... Actually my main block with the game currently is that I can't unlock any new classes because I can't get far enough without dying!\n\nThe main things that pop out to me are the diversity of classes, the world map you can explore and find hidden secrets in, and the wide variety of different spells and tactics you can employ to fight your enemies. You can be an archer and shoot from afar (infinite ammo with reloading- carrying stacks of arrows be damned!), be a trapper and set tons of traps while stealthing around, become several different types of mages and magic casters and much much more.\n\nThe graphics are ok, honestly the weak point of the game to me. I feel like people could get easily turned off by the trailer as the graphics look like some old PC freeware game- but I think they're bearable once you're in game, and I think it's cool how your character changes depending on what armour you're wearing.

Unlike traditional roguelike different classes play COMPLETELY different and indroduce new and interesting mechanics (like the manipulation of time for example). Almost every style of play is to be found here; from being a nasty necromancer and summoning skeletons and bone giants to slaughter your enemies to the time manipulating bow - dual weapon hybrid to the anti-magic \"slime mage\" that posisons his enemies, summons slimes to control the battlefield and uses PSIBLADES (F***ING PSIONIC LASERSWORDS).\nIn addition to the HUGE amount of classes, the classes themselves are extremly complex by having many different skill-trees to develop and unlock. While some people might see this as a negative I feel like this adds a lot of complexity of depth to the game and makes you able to play classes in completely different ways.\n\nTL;DR: DO YOU LIKE DEEP RPGs?

I loved that game and played it over and over, although I never had the discipline to beat it.  Tales of Maj'Eyal stands out from the plethora of mediocre 'roguelike' games that are so trendy recently. TOME is a worthy successor to the likes of rogue, netHack, Angband, and Slash'Em in every way.  \n\nNot only does the game offer a large, procedurally generated world to explore but there are also many very well-designed classes to do it with.  Where the game really shines is it's ui.  The fantastic use of color makes item details readily appreciable despite their complexity.  The auto-explore feature reduces the tedium of fully mapping a level, while sacrificing none of the level of tactical control required for difficult fights.\n\nSince TOME uses a scaling level system (within ranges set by the zone), there is no need to have the type of food/hunger system used to force the player to advance deeper in the older games.  I always found a system that forced me to rush (or rely on random spawns for food) to be irksome.\n\nThe character classes are really diverse and unlocking them provides amusing challenges outside the central goals of the game.  Spells, abilities, and customization within a class all dramatically affect the playstyle.  Abilities feel like they have a real impact and boss/rare monster fights require tactics tailored to the encounter as well as the player's build.\n\nThe Steam login and chat system now work very well so you can chat with other players.

In some areas it may be hard to see a monster next to an obstacle but this may be by design. It also has ASCII mode for old school roguelike nerds like myself.\n\nSound: 3/5 Not horrible but not great. The music mostly fits the areas but some of the sound effects just sound wrong to me.\n\nDifficulty: 5/5 Like most roguelikes, this game is not supposed to be easy. ToME does have adjustable difficulty levels to appeal to a broader audience. You can start with a set number of lives or go typical roguelike style permadeath. You can adjust your experience from casual gaming to pulling your hair out.\n\nGameplay 5/5: ToME is different than most roguelikes in that it has a somewhat open and explorable world as opposed to a single dungeon and maybe a town. The player starts in an area that depends on the characters race. These areas range from simple to brutal. The story is decent and there are plenty of other quests to occupy your time. This game is controlled by keyboard and/or mouse. This makes it easy for an experienced RL player or a novice to jump right in after the brief tutorial. The level generation is done well enough to make each playthrough feel unique and the battles require just the right amount of strategy to keep the game interesting. There are various unlocks that range from things you will do in a normal game to tedious quests.\n\nOverall: 4/5 If you are an oldschool rogueliker, then you are probably already familiar with some version of ToME. If you are newer to the genre and want to play a difficult dungeon crawler with some exploration then this game is worth looking at.\n", "timestamp_created": 1427170903, "timestamp_updated": 1427170903, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15027793": {"recommendationid": "15027793", "author": {"steamid": "76561197966533518", "num_games_owned": 1005, "num_reviews": 237, "playtime_forever": 202, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1427157889}, "language": "english", "review": "Nope, just not my kind of game, I guess.

At this point I can say it is more than good.  This roguelike is pretty brilliant if you ask me.  And I think it's developed by just one dude.  That's the impression I've been given.\n\nTurn-based combat, a large amount of enemy variety, some randomly generated elements, and strong character building makes for a good amount of fun and diversity in every playthrough.  There are many races and classes for you to choose from too, all with their own unique qualities in the form of different stats and skills.  There's good variety in the armor, weapons, and the many other items you can find and equip as well.  Pretty good sized map to explore, and the game has well written lore and dialogue.  Lots of humor, but also some pretty twisted stuff.  It's great.\n\nYou can also select a difficulty setting AND a permadeath setting at character creation.  The two are separate things.  There are 5 difficulty settings ranging from Easier to Madness.  And 3 permadeath settings.  Roguelike which gives you one life (unless you find a rare way to resurrect yourself).  Adventure which gives you multiple lives.  And Exploration which gives you infinite lives.  I've mostly been trying Nightmare/Roguelike.\n\nThere are 1386 achievements.  Most of them are repeated achievements for different difficulties/permadeath settings, but if you do an achievement on a high difficulty/permadeath setting you can get the lower ones along with it (consult the Steam forums to find out how).  Along with achievements, there are a bunch of secrets you can unlock.\n\nThe game also has two DLC.  Both are cheap, so if you buy the game pick them up as well.  One adds new classes and two new zones.  The other is a Steam UI celebrating their launch on steam.

So much has been poured into it's universe and lore, and that's just the offical main module for the game.  TLDR: Buying this game will be the best thing ever for your rougelike, turn based, strategic, leveling, rage inducing needs.\n\nThe world map is consistantly the same, but the dungeons and places are randomized classic rouge dungeons that have themes, leveled content, and many many trolly rougelike goodness waiting inside.\n\nSkills and healing are on turn cooldowns in addition to costing mana/stamina to use, making the whole game really strategic.  The fact everything is turn based yet updates in an instant means the game plays at exactly the pace you can keep up with it.  If you are taking your time reading stats, the game won't do anything till you take action.  But if you pretty much just want to wander down a few hallways to that old room, a single click will instantly have the game \"run\" you over there, and if anything happens along the way (such as enemies coming into view) the game will stop and go back into \"single turn\" strategy mode.\n\nRace and Class are seperate in character creation, and all play different enough that you'll be playing a totally different tactic, yet are based on the same stat and skill tree like system, so you'll know exactly how to figure out the new class.\n\nAdd in workshop support for many modded race/class/modules, the open nature of the modding, and the existing website's large community of players and creators, and you'll quickly see why this is one of the best things you will ever buy if you are even remotely interested in rouge-like games.\n\nIt's also sufficently rage inducing when you die.  Just a fair warning.  It does follow the rouge game logic of \"learning by death\", so don't become too attached to your characters.  Much rage, followed by \"I really shouldn't have done X\" moments.  You can start as the same character on death, and the gameworld has ways to get \"lives\", even in permadeath mode...so it's a tiny bit more forgiving then your usual rouge.  But only a tiny bit.\n\nIt should be noted you can play this for free (with some limitations) from the website of the game.  Paying for the game on steam gets you the \"Donation\" version, with all the limitations removed, same as donating through the site directly.  The steam version can log into an account made with the free version.

Unlike most roguelikes, there's an overworld with towns, said overworld and said towns are not randomly generated, but have fixed layouts, only the dangerous areas that would loosely define as \"dungeons\" are random in layout. Each option feels quite different, and usually has a somewhat unique play style, with race choice as well as class. The game doesn't exactly feel unfair until mid to late levels when the adventure starts getting into ridiculous territory.\n\nVisuals for something as lightweight as this and static sprites are quite nice, there's some 3D effects and 2D effects based on special abilities being used, the sprites are large and detailed enough to know what you're facing before you mouse over it.\n\nControls are fairly simple, opting for an action bar where you can slot all your different items/abilities, which may deter some of the hardcore players of roguelikes. There's also mouse support, and right clicking on your character or other things allows one to play mostly with the mouse if one prefers.\n\nSound is present, there's music for every area, sounds for different attacks and special abilities, nothing to really write home about, but it's not bad.\n\nGame mechanics are fairly solid and scale up to the point of more or less halfling going toe to toe with kaiju god-slaying robot of death, though quite a few of the mechanics are not 100% intuitive, difficulty is pretty variable with lots of options. Achievements are a colossal pain in the arse though, as a result, as getting an achievement in one difficulty setting doesn't unlock it for any others, and a lot of the achievements have 12 variations or so based on difficulty settings. Will say that some randomly generated enemies can be impossible to kill, I had an issue with a named bone giant who was impossible to kill at the level cap with ridiculously strong abilities as a summoner.\n\nThe game also has a plot and rewards you for being a nice person or a total jerk as well.

ToME is an incredibly deep and strategic RPG/roguelike which takes place in an insanely lore-rich world of classic high fantasy. \n\nThe game is strategic in that time moves in \"turns\", meaning time ceases to move between actions or movements. This allows you to carefully plan each action, rather than requiring twitch reflexes. If you want fast paced action, look elsewhere. Animation is minimal, yet the graphics are extemely charming, and convey quite clearly everything that is happening.\n\nCharacter creation is rich, deep, and super flexible, albeit extremely complex. I've played the same class a million times, but the result is always different depending on how I lay out the stats and skill points, which is probably my favorite part. I am constantly finding fun and oddball builds which get a million times farther than I expect. If you like making characters for tabletop rpgs you'll love this shit.\n\nThe difficulty is pretty brutal, but it always feels fair. There are ways to turn this down for chickens, or up farther for masochists and vets. As you play, you get better at making characters and becoming better at survival. But there are a TON of things to unlock too. There are different classes, races, and starting items to unlock in addition to \"campaigns\", which are essentially different game modes. If you get bored of adventuring around the continent, turn on endless dungeon mode. Tired of that? Arena mode is a blast too. \n\nBasically, this game is insanely fun, super challenging (and therefore rewarding), and the world is written with a very tasteful degree of seriousness. Humor can be found in dialogue but it is subtle and never breaks the immersion (no memes thank the lord.)\n\nIf you enjoy roguelikes and don't have this game, do yourself a favor and cop it! If you like it, go get that dlc too.

That's right, originally it was based on Tolkien's work and was an offshoot of a long lineage of games directly related to Rogue, via Moria and then Angband. There was a middle variant in there at some point called Pernband.\n\nSome back story:\nAt some point DarkGod (the main dev) decided to rewrite the client because the old angband client was full of spaghetti code and it became untenable. So came t-engine. Tome was then written as a module of T-engine (all made by DarkGod for no $$ I might add.) \n\nIn Tome 3 there were Jedi!!! and other fun ideas but it was chaotic. Tome 3 was a mess, (Tome 4 was much cleaner.) But it was still pretty opaque as Roguelikes go. I would tinker with it, have fun with lost souls etc and then get bored. So I went the way of many players got involved in other games only came back periodically when I got a yen for playing with Lightsabers again. At some point, I noticed Tome 4 was progressing and downloaded and everything was different.\n\nGone were most of the touches of the Angband and Tolkien worlds. You can still see a few here and there but TOME had become Tales Of Maj Eyal with an original story and a total reworking of the graphics and mechanics. On and off Ive done some beta testing (though my forums account from then was deleted more than once so I guess being inactive on the forums is a good way to get culled.) \n\nAt some point I managed a couple of end games. I won once and once I sacrificed my guy (I still don't know why that doesn't count as a win...) \n\nEvery time I came back more and more stuff was added and then I saw that they had finally made the leap to Steam. I wanted to buy it immediately because I believe in the game and the devs and why not support them? But I was reticent with all the other games I have and also had to wait for money to pay for it anyway. \n\nI probably should not have waited but I did and when I did finally get the steam version I was not disappointed with either the basic game or the DLC (which I had no previous knowledge of.) \n\nDivergent note that tangentially relates to this review: \nBob Dylan has said on songwriting that if you can't change a song, if you can't mess with the words or change the arrangements it is dead and you should bury it. That is a paraphrase because I don't have the exact quote on hand. But this is how I feel about games. TOME is a living game, always changing. \n\nMany pay to play games are not. They merely make some stuff they took out initially available for DLCs when the wells run dry. TOME is not like those games. TOME is developed by a caring group of dedicated players and programmers who are making an epic play experience.\n\nYes epic. You have a ton of races and classes which unlock as you play. Sometimes the unlock is just something you were going to do anyway but sometimes in true RPG fashion you have to investigate and figure out some puzzle or quest to get the unlock you want. And you can unlock them in something like 9 different modes. The game offers 50 levels of experience in whatever build combo you choose. As you learn more about classes and races you find yourself getting deeper into the decision making process and you realize you have many more choices than you will quickly be able to play with. This could take a long time. As is without any further changes. And the game changes from game to game so you may not always get an event or area you thought you might. And different play styles create vastly different approaches and in-game storylines. \n\nThere was a lot of discussion when Maj'Eyal became the world of the game about how terribly difficult the game was (is) so now there are multiple modes for discovering the game. The most rewarding depends on your personality and proclivities as a gamer. You can play with Easy and Exploration and virtually never risk death, or you can unlock, insanity and madness modes and play only in true Roguelike fashion (1 life, though there are items you can find to hedge that bet.) Or you could play as I do on Normal with Adventurous. To each player their own. This is an innovation I wish more devs would think about. Multiple play modes for multiple types of players means more fun for everyone.\n\nThe game has a few pit falls. It is deep so it is not hard to get into trouble if you are tired, hungry or bored. Don't do that. Play when you are fresh and excited and keep it that way. You won't complete it in a day. (The main quest line takes a minimum of 10 hours I think if you skip everything else and I highly recomend you don't do that.)\n\nYou may also find that the game lore is hard to penetrate. This is partially due to writing style and partially because who wants to read so much of it? Yes you should read the lore the first time you encounter it at the very least. You may or may not glean valuable clues from it but if you need to you can go back to it later. Once you have unlocked certain features you will be able to access ALL of the lore you've ever seen as a player. \n\nYou may notice that I am not giving a lot of specifics here because part of the fun of this game is playing it unspoiled. You can of course look stuff up or ask for spoilers if you aren't into all that.\n\nI will say the sound effects while fairly professional are not my cup of tea. I am not really a game sounds kind of player though. I typically turn sound off in games I play and I only checked them out in TOME out of curiousity. You might find them entertaining. Apparently, also there is music. Something I didn't check out. (I am an older guy with a very staid taste in music. If it isn't Classic Rock. Folk, Blues or Soul from the 60s-70s then it probably isn't on my mp3 player. Though I do enjoy more varied styles, when I am gaming that's mainly what I listen to.)\n\nI write all this mainly to enthuse about how much I am enjoying playing TOME again and want you to know it is worth every penny to buy it on steam.  The community addons alone make the game extremely customizable. \n\nGandolfo in game chat, Winter Wolf on Steam.", "timestamp_created": 1425504739, "timestamp_updated": 1425504789, "voted_up": true,

"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474857110}, "language": "english", "review": "I have sort of conflicted feelings about Tales of Maj'Eyal. In short, if you judge it purely as a roguelike, I don't thing it don't hold up too well. Part of the reason I may think that may be my preference for NetHack influenced roguelikes, and my lack of familiarity or appreciation for Angband influenced or Ancient Domains of Mystery influenced rogelikes, but I am not sure how much Tales of Maj'Eyal's design is based on those games.\n\nOn the other hand, judged as a RPG Tales of Maj'Eyal does a lot of things right. It has a rather interesting tactical battle system, lots of different character creation options, many ways to tweak and customize your skills, any many items to find that offer a lot of tactical death. It's story, while perhaps presented in a way that relies too much on finding and reading lore text, is at least interesting and presents a few dark twists on the standard high fantasy setting. \n\nNo mater how you judge it, the interface is great, mostly easy to use but able to do a lot, the battles are fast-pasted and fun, and it can be very addicting. The graphics are simple but more then functional enough for what they are, and there are enough interesting special effects and visual flare to make up for the more static sprites. The music is generic but memorable and sometimes can actually be pretty fantastic, even if it is more or less all part of free game music packs. \n\nI think that is all that really needs o be said, but here is some more detail about how I think about it as a roguelike:\n\nThe big problem with Tales of Maj'Eyal's design as a roguelike is simply that the game is too long, story heavy, and not random enough. There is variation in the loot you get and the monsters you face, but the over all world is basically set. Same world map, same town, same quests. The layout of a lot of the random zones are different but the basic themes of the zones are set, and each zone has a set rank for items, a set number of floors, a set list of enemies and possible bosses. Due to how the game is balanced and how enemies never respawn except in a few cases, it's basically required to repeat every zone and sidequest each run or you end up drastically underleveled very quickly, and due to each zone having fixed level requirements you can't even vary the order that much.  \n\nAlthough you actually have multiple lives before dieing in the default mode, permadeath still is a problem and when it happens you have to start over from he start and go through the same old stuff you already saw again. There is a mode where you can simply have infinite lives, but I kind of wish there was some kind of middle ground, perhaps a way to start over with a new character but with a number of story events that carry over and alter the world. There is a unlock system that adds new races, classes, skill trees, and other things, and that helps, but it still only adds so much and may of the unlocks are obscure or tedious.\n\nI also have a problem with a lot of the streamlining or elimination of a lot of roguelike staples potions and scrolls are gone, and instead characters can equip a number of infusions or runes that can be used over and over again but have a cooldown timer between uses (actually every skill and magic spell in Tales of Maj'Eyal uses cooldown timers, I am not really a fan of them but it works). Wands and other tools work in a similar way as well. This eliminates stockpiling of consumable items, but also eleminates the sort of careful rationing of your resources you need to worry about in other roguelikes.\n\nIt's only logical because of this that the whole item identification game is gone and no items have overall negative effects, eliminating the kind of risk vs reward of using items in a panic. Many people may not like needing to worry about identifying stuff but the feature exists in roguelikes for a reason, the same reason randomized levels exist, to make sure you can't just win with rote memorization, and so every action you take has to be done very carefuly. Roguelikes since the original Rogue have always been about exploration and experimentation and the whole idea with unknown items was a big factor in that. \n\nBut again, despite all of these things I don't like about it as a roguelike, I still think it's a really good RPG. Maybe there isn't really that much of a difference, most roguelikes are basically RPGs after all, I just thought I would share my feelings on the subject.", "timestamp_created": 1423821795, "timestamp_updated": 1423822322, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502427", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14436525": {"recommendationid": "14436525", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057296366", "num_games_owned": 95, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 2374, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1450609966}, "language": "english", "review": "The single best paid roguelike I've ever had the pleasure of playing. \n\nIt's incredibly addicting, it offers a variety of unlockable content (races, classes, sub-classes, skill trees, even questlines), it caters to different playing styles, it comes with a nice tileset (and the option to 'downgrade' the visuals to ascii), a great soundtrack, an overworld with towns and shops, an intriguing storyline and lore and full mouse support. \n\nThe combat system is skill and cooldown based so it might even be appealing for RL beginners that played modern RPGs before. \n\nKeep in mind that you can download this game for free on the dev's website -

All the traits and talents and character stats all have very in-depth write-ups when you mousover them, and since the game is true to the turn-based concept, you can truly play at your own pace.\n\nThis game comes closest to the feel of that old game I spent so many hours on back in the days of \"shareware\", Castle of the Winds.  I personally have been looking for a game that brought that wholesome turn-based, warm, fuzzy feeling in my gutty wuts for the better part of two decades, and it would seem that I have found exactly that.\n\nThere is some kind of patch/crack/thing that can unlock all the races and classes without having to earn them properly, but I haven't implemented it yet after however many hours I've played, and I don't think I'd enjoy the game more without having to earn the unlocks.  Get the DLC.\n\nI can't recommend this game highly enough.  Pour in the hours.  Keep em coming.  Drink deep.

I buy anything and everything that tickles my fancy. About a quarter of my purchases are terrible, horrible mistakes (The Guild II, 7 Days to Die, etc.) that never get more than an hour's playtime before I uninstall them in disgust. I always regret buying those games, but that's the price of window shopping.\n\nThen there are the games that are decent for a playthrough, maybe two, before I move on and forget about them. They tend to be solid games (Shadows of Mordor, Two Worlds II, Shadowrun, etc.) but nothing to write home about. They make up a good 65% of my library.\n\nThe last 10% are absolute masterpieces, that I will never tire of playing. I'm happy to say that ToME fits snugly into this category. I purchased it due to its aggregated review score and its resemblance to Dwarf Fortress, expecting that I'd get a week or two of enjoyment out of it before I got bored and moved on. Well, let me tell you, that is [b]not[/b] going to happen.\n\nIn a nutshell, I'd describe ToME as [b]a streamlined version of Dwarf Fortress adventure mode, with the emphasis shifted from proc-gen content to coherent and enjoyable adventures[/b]. Now, I know that some DF purists will be turned off by that description - after all, procedurally-generated worlds and histories are a big part of DF's appeal, aren't they? - but bear with me.\n\nWhereas DF uses proc-gen to determine EVERYTHING, from cultures to the landmass to [url=mikaelisaksson.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/DF_Cheese.jpg]an individual's fascination with cheese[/url], ToME uses it sparingly. The world map, quests, and bosses stay relatively constant from playthrough to playthrough (though there are occasionally some small variations in the last category). This has allowed DarkGod (the one-man dev team behind ToME) to build an extremely long, complex, and open-ended plotline that will see players through 50 experience levels - and for the record, if you play roguelike mode, you'll have a hell of a time even breaking 20.\n\nWhere proc-gen is used, it is used very gracefully. All dungeons randomize their layouts (and to a lesser extent, their themes) for each new playthrough, and gear, with the notable exception of the rare, unique items, is also random. Minibosses, which randomly appear throughout dungeons after the initial quest has been completed, are all named, given a random race (anything from masses of worms to furry little Ewok slave-drivers), and given an arbitrary group of abilities. To put it simply, though the broad strokes of the game are fixed, the details of every run will be distinct and unique.\n\nThere`s one more aspect of the game that bears mentioning in reference to encouraging multiple playthroughs, and that`s character design. When you first start the game, approximately 75% of the classes, 50% of the races, and 66% of the game modes will be locked. Mind you, that still leaves you with something like 7 races and a dozen classes to choose from. As you complete certain events, various aspects of the game will be unlocked for future playthroughs. There`s nothing more exciting than unlocking a class encouraging an entirely new playstyle after a long, epic campaign.\n\nEven within a single class, the room for freedom of choice is incredible. Every class has somewhere between 30-60 skills associated with it, each of which has five levels of expertise. In addition, you receive another 30 or so skills to choose from based on your race. Considering that even in a perfect playthrough, you`re only likely to get 160 skill points or so, you`ll never be wanting for new ideas for character builds. It bears mentioning that on top of all of this, there are ways to learn the skills of [i]other[/i] classes too.\n\nI'm going to end this review with a quick pro/con list, since those are all the rage on Steam these days.\n\n[b]PROS[/b]\n\n-Nearly infinite replay value\n-Strong RPG elements\n-[b][u]Farscape references[/u][/b].

I play so that each time, I can get just a little bit further. That's the thing about roguelikes. They aren't about learning to play the game, and then playing it. You can't be said to know how to play the game until you've won.\n\nFor a game I've never gotten past the first third despite having played it for over 70 hours, I can't really claim that the sameyness keeps me from playing.

I didn't want the \"starting\" excitement to overwhelm me.\nAfter having played this game with several characters, I can say that every playthrough, I get more and more excited about this game. For me, this game is difficult and hardcore, I am not that experienced with rpg's but this game makes me want to be and every playthrough, I feel like I have learned new things.\nFor the first time, I carefully think about choices I make, what should I level up, how should I handle this enemy. For the first time, I take my time for every turn (usually with this kind of games, I rush through my turns as if it was real-time). The game makes me want to use my skills and intelligence and for me, this is a first-timer.\n\nThe funny thing is, I had this game marked as \"Not Interested\" originally, but came here by reading a review under another -not so good- game. That other game had much better graphics, but I don't care about graphics. On the other hand, because I had mostly been dissapointed by roguelikes with low-quality graphics (although TOME actually has relative good graphics for its genre) I had never looked at this game in detail. It was after that other review and seeing that people have actually spent a whole year in playtime on this game that I got interested.\n\nThat's sad... because this game is REALLY worth it. And it certainly is worth the price. I bought it at -30% and now I feel like they could easily charge 3x the price (and even more) and it would still be worth it. This game needs a commercial boost :-)\n\nI am really enjoying this game, dying all the time and stuff like that. I prefer adventure-mode because I can die several times before it is game over, but I still don't want to die (like you could play through in exploration mode) so it still makes me try to play it roguelike (which is too hard for me at this time).\n\nI also like how this game builds up unlocks: especially for me, being not that experienced, I like that in the beginning not all character types can be played and must be unlocked. It makes me build up my knowledge about the game and probably only when I am ready to learn about new types of character, they will be unlocked.\n\nI wonder if I will stop buying other games on steam now for the next year because if I look at other people playing this game (2500 hours of playtime), it seems like I will never get bored with this game and will never need another game :-).\n\nI think I can safely say that this game is for all kinds of RPG players: the beginners and the very experienced.\n\nBuy it! Buy it now! :-)\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention: it has a very very very good community.

It was originally posted in January 2015 as \u2018negative\u2019, and is from March 2015 onwards rated as \u2018positive.\u2019 In addition, the content has been altered to reflect recent changes to the game.\nFirst of all, know that this is not a \u2018rogue-lite\u2019. I have yet to see the final level, and there are others on the forums who have played for hundreds of hours and have yet to win the game. \nFor the TL;DR people: The game is amazing, but completing it on normal difficulty will take hundreds of hours because the learning curve is steep, and end-game balance depends on creating the most powerful build you can \u2013 theory crafting is a must, and if you don\u2019t, the game will become unwinnable 30 hours before you realize it. For the rest of us, read on.\nToME has 26 classes at the time of this writing, all of which feel and play very differently. Like most RPGs, skill points are gained upon leveling and can be used for both active and passive effects. The skills for each class are unique and allow players to develop their own playstyles, though generally each class has its own style of combat and a playstyle that rewards sticking to their class-specific strengths. Summoners draw hordes of creatures to overwhelm opponents, archmages channel elements to great effect over an area, and rogues set traps and use stealth to outmaneuver or outwit opponents. There are even more creative classes in here, like a time warden (or time mage) that specializes in temporal effects and paradoxes.\nThe world has tons of surprises and interesting levels/areas to explore, acceptable story and interaction (for an old-school roguelike) and though nothing ever changes, the vast variety of mechanics assured that the game did not get old for me after 100 hours of gameplay, and likely will not for another 100 hours.\nBut Tales of Maj\u2019Eyal does have its problems. The first and perhaps least bothersome is a learning curve that feels more like a cliff than a slope.\nThe tutorial explains a little of the game's mechanics, but understanding is better gained by blundering through the world and slowly learning what each of the many confusing formulas and statistics mean, and how important they are to the core gameplay. It takes dedication to keep coming back when mountains of unknown skills and abilities assail you from every side, and through trial-and-error, learn to slowly overcome that mountain. Perseverance does pay off \u2013 I actually enjoyed the game very much once I crossed the barrier between hopeless bungler and still-hopeless-but-educated noob. \nThe larger problem is that in order to win the game, the player\u2019s character must be designed for perfection \u2013 built to optimal capacity with a full understanding of the many talents, stat formulas, status effects and saving throws present in the game engine. It\u2019s not enough just to go with the most damage, or discover the best damage reduction, or center your build around strategic options \u2013 you must do all of these things, and do them with the dedication of a crazed League of Legends professional gunning for the gold.\nThis is where the game fell apart previously \u2013it can become unwinnable very early on, and new players will never even know. They may even feel overpowered for a while, as they make one-strike KOs against hordes of enemies and pass tens of dungeons without a serious challenge in any of them. Rares, elites, and bosses fall without challenge - then suddenly, a belligerent abomination of a boss-class monstrosity strikes, and they find themselves hopelessly outmatched, their only recourse to grind for levels.\nSo they go to a new dungeon \u2013 and it happens again. Another new dungeon \u2013 wait, were the normals this hard before? And why can\u2019t I use my spells? My abilities? Where did everyone go? And\u2026 how did I get one-shot by THAT? \nPlayers be warned: No matter how many lives you have, you can make a mistake in your character build early on and not realize that your character is doomed until late-game, when you have already invested thirty-or-more hours into their development. With permadeath, obviously, you may not live long enough to realize your character build is impossible to win with. But even with unlimited lives, you will eventually reach the point where the bosses are impossible, and no matter how well you fight, how clever your tactics, you have no option but to die \u2013 or quit. Before the 1.3.0 update, this meant that you must start the game over again from the beginning.\nThis is why my review changed from negative to positive. While limited and full-permadeath players will still have to deal with the intense frustrations of sub-optimal builds, there is hope for those playing with unlimited lives after the 1.3.0 update: Full talent re-spec is available at all times, so if you\u2019ve created a build that seems sub-optimal to your playstyle or eventually becomes self-defeating, you can easily change your skills to accommodate your newfound knowledge or equipment. Be warned, however, that stat points and category points are still permanent, so consider playing a Cornac (+1 cat points) your first time and keeping some stat points in reserve for future use while you learn the ins and outs of your chosen class.\nAlso, be warned that there is no way to carry multiple save files for your character in this game. The game will save on entering and exiting a dungeon, as well as upon making most major decisions, and you will have to live with the consequences of your actions. \nSo to recap: Tales of Maj'Eyal as it is an interesting game that supports a wide variety of skill sets and play styles, though impressive knowledge of the game mechanics that can only be acquired through vigilant study required to develop a successful playstyle. Full talent re-spec alleviates (but not eliminates) the steep learning curve, but if you like RPG roguelikes with unique classes and deep strategy, investing your time in this game will reward you with probably the best roguelike you\u2019ve ever played. Just be prepared to invest heavily.\n*Full disclosure here - I played the game on 'normal' difficulty for every playthrough. There is an easier difficulty that decreases the monsters' strength/abilities by 30%, but it does not give classes, races or achievements and so it does not appeal to those like me who want to feel they are accomplishing something while playing.", "timestamp_created": 1420190843, "timestamp_updated": 1426653757, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505515", "comment_count": "14", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1420587661, "developer_response": "Hi, thanks for taking the time to do such a write-up, feedback is always good :)\nTo address some of the points more specifically:\n[list]\n[*] \"Easy\" difficulty mode only bars from achievements and those few unlocks tied to them.

It's fairly forgiving, in that you can start on easy mode, with unlimited lives (but no achievements) to figure things out, then once you've got the hang of it, you can change it up to a harder version. \n\nIf you're someone who has to get every achievemnt though, this game will take a LOT of your time. I first got it from DarGod's website, played it for a hundered plus hours, then heard it was on steam, so I bought it here too (on a friends shared account) and started playing it. I earned a hundred or so achievements before I just started playing under my account. And then I realized that I had to re-earn those achievements. I felt better when I realized that those hundred I earned? not even 15% of the total possible. Yeah, that's right, there's not 100, not 200, but over 1300 achievements for this game.\n\nSo like I said if you need to have EVERY achievement, this will take you some time, especially since at least one of the achievements is nearly impossible. You have to beat the optional boss, who is a super archmage/god (not kidding about that, it's part of the amazing in-depth lore of this game) on the hardest difficulty setting, with one life. Oh yeah, and she can come back to life a few times. Oh, and she gets stronger each time she does it. And she is in the middle of a town full of mages, who also attack you. But at least you can attack first, right?\n\nSo for those who don't want to spend the next 3 years trying to get that achievement, it's still an amazing game, with good graphics (for a roguelike) a great story, fun unlock systems, and interesting combat.

Every time I went hunting for a new roguelike, I'd find ToME, look at the screenshots, wrinkle my nose at the tileset, and move on.\n\nA combination of peer pressure and exasperation at the four million half-baked early access games I'm waiting on finally tipped me over the edge to get it -- and I'm glad I did. Finally. I've been missing a lot of fun.\n\nSo! Here's what I'm digging about ToME:\n\n1. Maybe this is mentioned in the reviews for it, and I've just somehow always glossed over it, but ToME has a really interesting set of skills that rely on various energy bars, cooldowns, and other variables. Even my very-straight-forward berserker has a hopping action bar that's a handful to manage. Honestly, it reminds me (pleasantly) of MMO combat. Just, you know, without the ganking, loot drama, time commitment, spouse aggro, RSI...\n\n2. It's not early access. Invictus, I take back every eye-roll I ever aimed at you for avoiding the early access games I'd recommend to you, because I'm there now. Holy mother of pogo-jumping Christ, is it pleasant to play a game that's finished and working and not possibly maybe someday in the future going to not suck, honest.\n\n3. There's a global chat where everyone currently playing ToME can talk with eachother. I'm really enjoying this, even though it's usually just a ticker for achievements and the new and exciting ways people are finding to die. Occasionally conversations or questions will spring up. Feeling like a single-player game has a shared community is a new thing to me, I guess.\n\nI only have two quibbles with the game, and they're utterly cosmetic: some of the tunes aren't so hot (and all of them are short enough that the repetition wears on you very quickly), and I really don't like the tileset.

This game is THE exception.\n\nIf you ever played NetHack, uMoria, Rogue, or any other classic Rogue-likes, you must purchase this game. As you can see from my collected play time, it has eaten a significant chunk of my life (literally my most highly played game). \n\nI regularly buy both indie and AAA games, and this is, by far, the most fun I've had on Steam (well...except for maybe FTL).\n\nPotential Positives:\n+ Turn based world - Monsters move when you move. Take your time.\n+ Not for the faint of heart - Remember when games used to be hard? So does this developer.\n+ Unlockable races and classes - Replayability, anyone?\n+ Dungeons combine randomness with structure - Key elements are always there, but many elements change between adventures.\n+ The price is super low - You could buy this game 8 or 9 times for the price of one AAA game.\n+ Active development - Last update was about 2 weeks before this review.\n\nPotential Negatives:\n- You're going to die - a lot.

It does an excellent job of providing everything that makes a roguelike great in a format that is extremely accessible both for hardcore fans of the genre as well as more casual players looking to get their feet wet.  The sheer amount of content in this game is incredible.  The storyline and lore are deep and enjoyable while the gameplay, particularly the combat, remain consistently engaging.\n\nTales of Maj'Eyal does a good job of easing a new player into the world and game mechanics by restricting the initial race and class offerings and expands outward with a number of persistent unlockables including new races, classes, and items that will become available to your future characters as you progress forward through additional sessions.  The distinct classes (particularly with different race pairings) provide tremendously distinct play styles that will keep you on your toes and force you to adjust your gameplay to find success.\n\nTo sum this up simply:  This game is outstanding, anyone with even the most remote interest would do well to pick it up, it won't let you down (and in all likelihood will keep you playing and having fun for an exceptionally long time to come).", "timestamp_created": 1415481080, "timestamp_updated": 1415481080, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12838666": {"recommendationid": "12838666", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053741576", "num_games_owned": 239, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 81831, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508726923}, "language": "english", "review": "I don't play rogue-likes.\n\nThat was my starting point with ToME(4), aka Tales of Maj'Eyal.  I'm not really a fan of the genre, though I am a fan of tactical RPGs.  It was only after some interesting comments on another game forum (Grim Dawn, great game, look it up) that I decided to give ToME a try.\n\nUnlike some other rogue-likes, ToME gives you the option to play softcore.  There are varying difficulty levels in addition to different degrees of 'rogue-like-ness' (multiple lives; from 1 to infinite).  The classes vary from basic and simple (Bulwark, Rogue, Archmage, etc) to surprisingly unique (Mindslayer, Oozemancer, Solipsist, etc).  The unlock system can be a pain, but it does encourage you to progress through the game, explore and play various archetypes.\n\nThe lore is great; the world has been excellently crafted (imo).  While it doesn't read like a AAA novel, the depth of the backstory is pretty astonishing considering it's been done primarily by one man (props Darkgod).\n\nWhen it comes to the gameplay, everything is surprisingly newbie-friendly (for a rogue-like).  The UI is simple and easy, the controls are variable (keyboard and/or mouse, re-bindable) and the overly-complex item usage often found in the genre has been notably streamlined.  \n\nThe graphics are solid.   Now, take that with a grain of salt; this is a 2d game of tiles and sprites.  If you're anticipating something like Dragon Age, you're going to be disappointed.  I know that I was unpleasantly surprised.  That being said, it has definitely grown on me and it certainly gives enough information on what's happening.\n\nAll that being said, this IS a roguelike.  You WILL walk around a corner/open a door/open a chest and get exploded.  Careful, cautious play is highly encouraged.\n\nOverall, if you find yourself wanting to try out a roguelike but finding they are a little too 'hardcore' for you, give ToME a try.

You choose from a variety of races and a variety of classes, and even more can be unlocked of each. Depending on your race and/or class, you'll start out in a specific Zone(or dungeon if you'd like). Once you finish that Zone, or before, you can return the World Map, in which you can explore it looking for more dungeons, or look for towns in which you can purchase items or find quests.\n\nThis isn't like The Elder Scrolls, where most of the game is scaled to your level or ability, each Zone has a certain difficulty, and until you're more familiar with how difficult each one is, it's better to follow the quest log. It's true that with very careful and skillful management of your spells and/techniques that you can finish a Zone that's a bit higher than you level, but there's a limit that's very quickly reached.\n\nEach of the Zones layouts are randomly generated, though they always have the same theme(forest, cave, dungeon, etc.). However, the World Map is mostly static, meaning it doesn't shift too much between games. There are 4 main towns in the beginning for instance, 3 of them having 2 beginner Zones right next to them. These 4, and their Zones, are always in the same spot. While there are a couple more Zones that are found in the same spot, the location of all the other Zones(mostly the 'side' ones) shifts around the map between games\n\nFor the actual skills you use, they're divided up into 2 categories: Class and Generic. Class skills are like they sound: each Class has many skill trees with for skills in each, and it's up to you how you want to level them, though some trees have a level requirement. Then there's Generic. This category is mostly the same between Classes, however some Classes add an extra Generic tree or 2. Many Races also have extra Generic trees, though Races with buffs or extra trees are of course balanced in other ways.\n\nEach Race has different bonuses and penalties to their stats, health, and experience rate, along with their Race Specific Generic Trees. So obviously some Races will be better suited to certain play styles. While some races and classes cannot be used together for Story/lore reasons, all class/race combinations are viable throughout the game, though you may need to play a bit smarter in some cases. One last thing about races: While they all have bonuses and penalties, the 'Cornac Human' is the exception in that it has no bonuses, no extra Generic Trees, and no penalties of any sort, and I recommend that if you want to try a new class but don't know what to expect, the 'Cornac Human' is a good default choice. Oh wait, Cornacs start with 1 category point, as some categories need to be unlocked with a point before you can start investing in it's skills, You can also just use the Category Point to give yourself an extra Infusion/Rune Slot, I'll talk more of this later.\n\nAs for items, they are Armor, Weapons, Jewellery, Tools, and Infusions/Runes. All items except Infusions/Runes are randomly generated for the most part, the exception being Legendary/Unique items, which are always the same, but have very unique bonuses and sometimes penalties. They sometimes even give you a skill(with a cooldown), though Tools always give a skill while they are worn.\n\nInfusions/Runes are items which will pretty much let you 'equip' a skill, such as Healing, Regen, etc. You only have so many slots though. All classes and races, no matter the combination, start with 3 slots. When you get a Category point every 5 levels(or first if you're a Cornac), you can opt to use it to give you an extra slot. If you try to use an Infusion/Rune when all slots are filled, you'll be asked if you want to replace a currently equipped Infusion/Rune. If you do so, you do NOT get it back.\n\nI'll cut the review short here, else I'll waffle all day. I definitely recommend this game for any roguelike and/or RPG fan. Please keep in mind that there is a free version on their site. This version is the paid version, in which it gives you an item vault(that must be reached through a semi-difficult dungeon) with a few slots to transfer items or store them between characters. The paid version also has an extra class to play with, along with an extra mode. The extra class I won't name as it changes. The most recently added class is for the paid version only. When a new one is added, the previous one becomes free. The extra game mode is 'Exploration', which is the same as normal, but gives you unlimited lives.\n\nPlease note that the DLC listed below is not a part of the free version, though they can also be purchased on their and played in the DRM free version.", "timestamp_created": 1415336648, "timestamp_updated": 1415336648, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score":

Lets start at the begining. I am an old-school gamer at heart. I started gaming in the early 80's and was only recently introduced to the roguelike genre, which has actually been my favorite genre for about 2 years now. I know Rogue was put out in 80 or 81, but for whatever reason I never got into this genre (perhaps it is because I played alot of consoles at that time?). My first introduction to roguelikes was BoI, among other actual 'roguelites'.\n\nAnyways, I know the whole Berlin Interpretation of what a roguelike is, but really in the sense of ToME and others, it is just a great RPG with permadeath. This requires you to really take your time and think about your actions. Playing drunk, or while on the phone is certain death, am-I-right? \n\nTales of Maj'Eyal has a really neat universe set in place, with a great UI that is all keyboard based (although you can use the mouse, it is debatably less efficient). Compared to other 'true' roguelikes, this game has a great tileset and overall graphics that are very much appreciated. When you equip armor, so does your avatar. There is rain, mist, etc. \n\nKeep in mind you can get this game for free from the developers website, but you shouldn't. Donate, or buy it on Steam (basically a donation). Pay for it because this is top notch game developement. YOU WILL GET DOZENS OF HOURS OUT OF THIS. At least. \n\nIt is not multiplayer, but it is the first MSORPG... Thats right - Massive Single Player Online RPG. Its brilliant. You play your own game, yet are in constant chat with the rest of the world. There is even some sort of item sharing in this chat that I haven't used yet. Best part - no need for a Wiki - I simply ask a questions (I've asked dozens) and some kind soul always has an awesome response. Awesome community that is very helpful.\n\nTL;DR\n\n10/10 This is how game developement is done.", "timestamp_created": 1414707664, "timestamp_updated": 1414707664, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512351", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12698300": {"recommendationid": "12698300", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002238879", "num_games_owned": 40, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 107774, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4382, "last_played": 1514105020}, "language": "english", "review": "To me, this is the ultimate roguelike. My first roguelike was Castle of the Winds back in the mid-90s. I've since played other traditional RLs such as NetHack, as well as \"roguelike-inspired\" games such as the Diablo series and Path of Exile. ToME4 combines the best of both worlds in a package that is user-friendly, engaging, and extremely entertaining.\n\nThe problem with traditional roguelikes, by modern standards, is the poor user interface and sometimes opaque game mechanics. Their replay potential is very high, but the barrier to entry is equally high. ToME4 keeps the high replay factor while providing excellent GUI. It has full support for both mouse and keyboard controls. Information that would be relegated to wikis for other roguelikes is instead readily available to the player, which gives a very streamlined playing experience. You can jump right into ToME4 and start playing without having to spend hours reading. That's not to say the game is easy, however; I've put well over 100 hours into the game and I'm still nowhere close to finishing the primary campaign.\n\nOn the other side, this game takes some of the best features of action RPGs (e.g., Diablo) while avoiding the pitfalls of that genre. There's a strong element of character progression and customization, through complex gear as well as skills, and many race/class options. However, ToME4 avoids the grinding/farming gameplay that plagues most ARPGs because enemies in ToME4 don't respawn.

There's no health/mana pot chugging here which takes some of the tedium away from stacking potions to thinking about which abilities to use when. \n\nAlso, the storyline and overworld is static, while individual level layout and most npcs are randomized. This has it's own plus and minuses. Each area has it's own lore and strategy which planning for is part of the game and you wouldn't be able to do as much for completely randomized dungeons. On the other hand, if you are like me and like to rush to your death and try as many classes as possible, replaying the same quests and areas can start getting a little boring. However the game has a lot of different content and several starting areas to help alleviate the tedium of replaying the same starting areas over and over for each character.\n\nReally a must have for any roguelike fan, it does a lot of the traditional elements very well while bringing a lot of unique flavor and strategy of its own.", "timestamp_created": 1414624846, "timestamp_updated": 1414624846, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12681887": {"recommendationid": "12681887", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041152596", "num_games_owned": 227, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1091, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475229145}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041d\u0435\u0443\u0434\u043e\u0431\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0444\u0435\u0439\u0441, \u0443\u0436\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u043e\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043c\u0435\u0442\u043e\u0432. \u0412\u0441\u0451 \u043f\u043b\u043e\u0445\u043e \u0432 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0439 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0435.", "timestamp_created": 1414591196, "timestamp_updated": 1414591196, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.233963", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12681053": {"recommendationid": "12681053", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991729465", "num_games_owned": 624, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 14794, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509609255}, "language": "english", "review": "Best Rogue-like RPG in Steam", "timestamp_created": 1414586153, "timestamp_updated": 1414586153, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12681012": {"recommendationid": "12681012", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009914016", "num_games_owned": 535, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 4356, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479338166}, "language": "english", "review": "", "timestamp_created": 1414585910, "timestamp_updated": 1414585910, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12680283": {"recommendationid": "12680283", "author": {"steamid": "76561197962010396", "num_games_owned": 270, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 3917, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1458151317}, "language": "english", "review": "Good roguelike, technically an evolution of the old Tales of Middle Earth Angband variant but you won't notice unless you've played the old ToME.

If you have played roguelikes in the past, dont let the trailers give you the wrong impression of its interface or themes.  The game is actually quite good.\n\nA few technical details first.  The game is available for free on the creator's website.  Buying the game on steam unlocks some donator benefits such as a specific dotator only character class and item transfer between characters.  The game also has its own login, this is to use the site's statistics tracking features, cloud saves (IIRC), and also lets you access an official IRC channel from within the game client itself.  You do not need to login to play the game.  The game performs very well, no complaints.  The game has a great deal of accessibility features, such as a very functional tileset, mouse controls, hud rescaling, and some automation as well.  Overall, very accessible.\n\nIn terms of game design, I have a few things to comment on.  I very much enjoy roguelikes that have a storyline element such as this one, because it gives a good element of cohesion to the game with goals and progression.  This one actually has a number of class or race specific scenarios that help add to this as well.\n\nThe game's skill progression system is skill-tree based, with each class having at least two different themed trees with several branches along with more generic ones to give you a few options on how you want to play your character.  For example, a necromancer might have both minion summoning and debuff curses with two trees each to pick between.  Many skills intuitively synergize or benefit each other, and the play also has the ability to acquire out-of-class skills a few times per game for even more flexibility.  The last few skill points can be unspent while in towns if you dislike a recent skill choice, and skills also show the effect of adding an additional skillpoint before you spend them, as well as what character stats influence the variables of those skills.  I find this skill tree system more accesible than a train/abuse stat system present in many other roguelikes, and while the transparency is not perfect it is VERY welcome.\n\nThe game's combat, as in all perma-death roguelikes, is focused on limiting situations in which you experience risk.  As in all roguelikes this means things like bottlenecking enemies into more controlled environments and crown control, but more notably lies in escape skills for this game.  Being able to leave a situation you will not be able to survive is very crucial in this game, as you almost always cannot simly heal through or face-tank some enemies.  You will be fighting a lot of enemies in this game and the game is quite long, but the game gives you both difficulty and permadeath options so that you may play the game in a method that you enjoy.  The default setting for permadeath gives you a number of lives, and you can accrue a limited number of additional lives at certain milestones in the game, thus letting you maintain risk without letting a single careless mistake end a heavy investment of game hours.\n\nThe game's replayability more or less lies in two things.  First, many zones have an alternate version of their randomly maps which have varied enemies and difficulty from their originals.  These can be surprising to discover after your first playthrough.

It is 2D and turn based, preferring gameplay and depth over graphical wizardry.\n\nOne important distinction between TOME and other roguelikes is the lack of emphasis on procedural generation. TOME actually has a plot, one that spans continents and the void between worlds, a story of darkness, magic and of course world domination. Throughout each playthrough, the story is the same, albeit with some slight alterations/additions depending on the actions you take and the starting class you select. There is a world map, and the major story locations do not change. Although the layout of each dungeon is procedurally generated, this is not empasised as a selling point of the game - it is merely a tool used to highlight the other qualities this game possesses. And boy are there a lot of qualities.\n\nFirst and foremost - the character classes. Good luck finding a more comprehensive, deep and exciting set of classes in any other roguelike, or any other GAME for that matter. TOME has over 15 of these, ranging from the stalwart Bulwark to the insidious Shadowblade to the righteous Sun Paladin, TOME has you covered for any kind of playstyle you wish to try. Each class then has a vast array of talent branches to follow, and the branches you choose to develop will essentially create a subset of the class you have chosen. The customisation possibilities are massive, resulting in a lot of replayability and tactical flexibility.\n\nCombat is a highly tactical turn based affair, with a strong emphasis on positioning, cooldowns, and your innate knowledge of your own abilities versus your opponent's. Once within your view, every enemy you encounter can be right-clicked on to view their statistics, abilities (passive and active) and resistances. There are no consumables in TOME. The use of each of your skills and items works on a cooldown system, and managing these cooldowns effectively will make the difference between you slaying a boss or becoming a small stain on a tower floor.\n\nAnd believe me, the latter will happen far more often than the former if you're not prepared, because TOME is HARD. Hard as in one-hit-kill hard. Hard as in the game gives you 3 options - Rogulike (1 life), Adventure (gain lives as you level up) and Exploration (infinite lives) - and taking the Roguelike option early on will result in tears. Hard as in some of the more powerful enemies in the game are comprised of two separate random character classes, and God help you if you face one with two even remotely synergistic classes under its belt.\n\nAnd to be honest, if there's one thing that drives me nuts about TOME, it is the difficulty. No doubt this makes me a console casual, but I'm serious. The difficulty of TOME is not embedded within the general gameplay, such as a game like Dark Souls, but rather in its frightening inconsistency of enemy threat. The existence of enemies with randomly combined abilities, together with the fact that there are over 10 different damage types (Fire Cold Darkness Light Mind Temporal Blight Nature bleh) means that at some point (normally after you've spent 10 minutes breezing through a horde of useless trash mobs) you will suddenly bump into a Godlike terror that sends you screaming into the abyss of death with a single, sloppy blink, simply due to having the perfect storm of resistances, abilities and relative level that results in a big tick in the Rekt column. Despite my affection for this wonderful, deep and mechanically interesting game, it is also by far the game I have rage-quitted the most.\n\nTL:DR Version....\n\nGood - Excellent character classes, tactical combat and involving storyline.\n\nBad - Insane difficulty spikes\n\nOverall - if you enjoy a good tough roguelike, you should already have this game!", "timestamp_created": 1412950405, "timestamp_updated": 1412950405, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 30, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.692847", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12433312": {"recommendationid": "12433312", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074443573", "num_games_owned": 192, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 9032, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512229160}, "language": "english", "review": "That game can be described in one word: amazing.\nI mean, beside being such a complex game created and maintained by one dev, it has dozen of features and things that make it even better:\n- Humor. Dialogues, story, everything is filled with dark, hidden, or obvious humor. Even the achievements have sometimes the best names I've ever seen (\"I cleared the room of death and all I got was this lousy achievement!\")\n- Death. You can probably die a thousand times differently. \n- Death (again). You can choose to have an amount of lives to spend, or you can go in full Roguelike-Permadeath-Nightmare/Madness difficulty, but in that game, you will die a lot, that's for sure.\n- Network. No multiplayer, but just a global chat, that also let you know when another payer achieves something, or DIES. So you know you're not alone.\n- MOD THAT GAME TO DEATH\n- You have so many classes and races to play as and to combine in the vanilla, you probably won't even know what to play anymore after you modded the game to death. There is probably a character-mod for every single creature in the game. There is even a mod that allows you to play as a TREE.\n- B*tch, I'm a Mega Turtle Storm Knight\n- The story is a big part of the game.

TIME. TRAVEL.\n\nOne of the best parts is that, in order to unlock classes and races, you have to do some pretty interesting things. For example, unlocking mages requires that you find the existence of mages, and some important finds affect later playthroughs, like finding the anti-magic people of Zigur or a certain chest that once you find all your characters start with.\n\nThis game is so awesome, that it helped me stay sane during a week of post-surgery lying face-down on a hospital bed.\n\nI reccomend this.

What makes TOME so great is the way it is designed allows it to be incredibly easy to get into for a beginner but still have enough depth and complexity for an advanced player, and unlike traditiational Roguelikes where you try to survive through one really big hard dungeon this has you survive through many mini-dungeons with an overworld map you can explore.\n+: Game mechanics are incredibly solid, stuff is for the most part well balanced and you can advance in the game well enough as any class really. It abandons the traditional roguelike mechanic of potion spam to heal and instead replaces it with a heal over time ability you can upgrade. There are no random deaths / mechanics that require you to have played the game already in order to know how to not die in this game either.\n+: Personally I think the game has one of the better loot systems for a roguelike, it's almost Action RPG-esque really.\n-: It's not really mentioned anywhere on the Steam page that this is normally a free game and the Steam version is just the donator version with Steam bonuses like Achievements & Workshop. By all means if you don't have the money for this game but are interested go download it on the official website. That said, I played the free version for a long time and finally donated when the Steam version came out since I wanted the steam benefits.\n-: If you don't play often you need to set Steam to not download updates automatically or else major updates can break your saves and you will lose progress. Rarely happens but it did happen to me and it does kind of suck.\n-: This is an [b]incredibly[/b] minor con here but the graphics aren't as good as other modern roguelikes like Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup.

Without those, why should I still play it you ask? For one, this game is incredibly hard (which is a good thing). Every mistake adds up, and you have to think about how you approach enemies depending on your character, which brings me to my favorite part.

Classes are more rpg oriented, each having unique multiple attacks and tactics to use during the battles.\n\nTL;DR:\nGreat game, you should play it.

As in, you shouldn't really count of ToME in the same group as Nethack, ADoM, or even Crawl. ToME is, first of all, much more focused on combat. There is no hunger, very little inventory management, very few ways (none?) to lose your character outside of actual combat.\n\n(for clarity: bump attack means an automatic attack that happens as your character attempts to enter a space occupied by a hostile character. Yeah, autoattack)\n\nThe combat doesn't much remind the bump/cast combat of most roguelikes. It's more like WoW, turn based. And I don't mean this in a bad way. Most turns you have to use skills even as a melee character, as opposed to bump attacking like you probably would in most actual roguelikes. There are a lot of skills, considering the game currently has at least 25 classes, many of which have multiple unique skill lines (each containing 4 skills). \n\nNow, let's get this out of the way: the game is free, unless you really want to buy it on Steam, or otherwise. The game is also easily worth the Steam price, and much more besides. A single playthrough can be easily over 10 hours, and the game has a lot of replayability. It is fun.\n\nDownsides? Having played this a lot (though not nearly as much as some), I'd say: the normal difficulty is way too easy, with some exceptions. The higher difficulties aren't viable on some classes (the higher you go, the less viable melee is, in general), and getting oneshot becomes increasingly an issue. There are ways to deal with getting oneshot, but they usually involve tedious gameplay. Like, using certain spells to check what's behind every corner, always. I personally *hate* playing like that, so currently I can either play on too easy difficulties, or play on challenging difficulties with random oneshotting mobs. Mind, you can easily get several playthroughs (like, 30h+) worth playtime before encountering this issue.\n\nErm.. so yeah.

It's fun messing around with the good amount of builds you can make in this game and there are more characters you can unlock from completing quests and such. The game itself isnt easy, Like most rogue-likes you're going to find yourself at first struggling, asking yourself what do I do next. Fear not. You have the mighty Z button, the Z button allows you to auto-explore and find random things in the stage,Take note that the auto-explore will go through everything around the stage so be careful you might find that special enemy you don't wan't to find along the way.\n\nBack to the game, There is a great soundtrack to the game, Which obviously helps greatly to immerse you more into the environment.\nThe game may look old but there is something about that art-style that is just appealing and fun to watch.\n\nIn gameplay terms you'll find yourself killed alot at first as you'll probably wonder what the hell every skill does or how to approach monsters/towns etc. But fear not there is a tutorial for the new players if they decide to take it.\n\nThe game itself has a nice character progression pattern, as in you gain levels, find gold and items/equipments that will drop or just be generater in the world you play in, this adds to the whole adventure experience and people who love loot will have a good time going through this game.\n\nYou can select different difficulties and unlike most rogue-likes you have the option to actually return to the game a few times depending on what mode you pick (obviously if you pick the harder ones once you die, you ded as hell).\n\nOverall Tales of Maj'Eyal is a great rogue-like game and I would recommend it to anyone who's looking for a game that they can actually feel like they're playing an old school rogue-like with modern touches to it.\n\nOn another note you can try the game on the developers website for free, But i'm not sure it contains all the content of the game so I would recommend buying it if you enjoy/like it.\n", "timestamp_created": 1403959108, "timestamp_updated": 1403959108, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10896053": {"recommendationid": "10896053", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999923906", "num_games_owned": 115, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 4568, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1416325748}, "language": "english", "review": "One of my first true Roguelike experiences and I enjoyed it very much.. would recommend.", "timestamp_created": 1403935039, "timestamp_updated": 1403935039, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500039", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10874540": {"recommendationid": "10874540", "author": {"steamid": "76561197979085971", "num_games_owned": 305, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 10094, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1450804768}, "language": "english", "review": "I haven't been able to do anything productive since installing this game.\n\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1403885238, "timestamp_updated": 1403885238, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500039", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10858184": {"recommendationid": "10858184", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000441083", "num_games_owned": 120, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 19505, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496693607}, "language": "english", "review": "I rate it a Brawler/10.\nIt was fun times.", "timestamp_created": 1403842575, "timestamp_updated": 1403842575, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502526", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10857749": {"recommendationid": "10857749", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041834544", "num_games_owned": 234, "num_reviews": 62, "playtime_forever": 13472, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1410920840}, "language": "english", "review": "I may not have many hours logged, but I've been playing the demo for quite some time now.

If you are down here reading reviews, it's because you're not 100% sure about getting the game, and figured it would help to see what other people think about it. Let me help you out, friend: Buy this game. \n\nI had my doubts too, at first. It's hard to tell what the game is like from the trailer, and the graphics ain't Skyrim. It's ok. Just buy the game, and you will be happier then you were in that soon forgotten time where you didn't have the game. \n\nYou want reasons? Ok, I have plenty of those. First off, this is one of the greatest Rouge style RPGs you will ever play. Easy to jump into, but will take many hours till you even begin to figure it all out enough to survive to level 20+. Multiple races and classes, and each class feels different, with multiple ways to develop. No potions to hoard, and death is always around the corner. Hotbar of actions like an MMO, including activated item abilities. Great sense of humor, and frequently updated. All done by one programmer, DarkGod, who randomly pops into the game to turn you into a rabbit. In this game you can eat the heart of a Sandworm, read monster poetry, and get killed by your future self. \n\nRouge mode is true Rouge, one death is all you get. Adventure mode gives you a few lives, and more as you level. The 3rd mode lets you keep coming back, but you don't want that mode. That mode is for squares. Try adventure mode, and try not to die before you make it to the Master. \n\nSeriously, this game is incredible. It is digital crack, and should be sold with a warning label. It's the top down rougelike MMOishRPG you didn't know you were missing. Great replayability, great depth, great community. Check out the forum for help on builds, or figuring out what all the stats/elements/statuses do. The Dev has been known to implement ideas right from the forums into the game. And if you are reading this during the big Steam Summer Sale, this game is selling for under $4. Did I mention that Z is the shortcut for auto-explore? Yep, it will even explore the board for you.

This wasn't the case in earlier versions of the game, but the large and increasing number of fixed artifacts and no need for identification scrolls made it somewhat pointless.\n\nPotions and scrolls are replaced by infusions and runes, which give on-demand abilities that consume no permanent resources -with a limited number of slots for these abilities. Regeneration infusions are the primary method of healing, replacing healing potions, and runes of teleportation replace scrolls of teleportation as an escape from trouble. Nothing is lost in their use, but they have cooldowns.\n\nA system for \"extra lives\". Before you crucify the game, extra lives is either a startup option akin to lowering the difficulty(\"roguelike\" mode for one life, \"Adventure\" for three, \"Exploration\" for unlimited) or through very rare artifacts or abilities in-game. Also, it doesn't save you if you decided to hug an Elven Corruptor and he blows you up the first turn you revive.\n\nDisable-heavy combat. Simply, being resilient to damage through armor or magical resistance is not as important as being difficult to disable. Stuns and confusion are the leading killers, not high burst damage. This makes it very easy to get chain-disabled and killed if you haven't prepared properly with high saving throws or effect clears(certain runes and infusions will remove a detrimental effect from you on use). \n\nAll of these things combined could make it seem like a somewhat casual roguelike, but in practice it isn't really any easier than similar contemporary roguelikes. The only element that is truly missing is resource management. You still must assess risks, prepare for and pick your battles carefully, and adapt to what the RNG has provided you. The cooldowns-based combat and lack of resource management should be considered an interesting spin, not an intentional dumbing down.", "timestamp_created": 1403225360, "timestamp_updated": 1403225360, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505211", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10530646": {"recommendationid": "10530646", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017358661", "num_games_owned": 1488, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 345, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490113547}, "language": "english", "review": "Very nice like RPG/Roguelike type thing; go around, get loot, build up your character.

So, even if you do die you can still advance through the entire game with all of your hard earned stats and gear! That's really like 3 versions of the game!  So far, it seems like a very solid and polished game. It's obvious that a lot of love went into the making of this game and it shows through the professionalism of the product. Everything is explained in great detail through text boxes.\n\nIt should also be noted that not all of the character races and classes are unlocked at the beginning of the game, and must be unlocked through playing the game. There are sub races and classes branching off of the main choices also.\n\nWhen you die in Exploration mode, you can teleport back to the battle before you died, but must fight that same battle from the beginning again, or teleport a little further back out of harms way.  You also get the choice to retire your character roguelike style, so be extra careful when making one of these choices after dying!  That is the only penalty for death that I have seen so far, but this is only based on my experience playing on Easier difficulty and Exploration mode (unlimited lives).\n\n\n\nPros:\n+3 game modes; Roguelike (perma-death), Adventure (limited lives) & Exploration (unlimited lives).\n+5 difficulty settings.  Easier, Normal, Nightmare & 2 more locked settings.\n+Generous level cap of 50.\n+Extensive character customization with skill trees and infusions.\n+No consumables.  You don't have to worry about food or water.\n+Ammo is unlimited, but you will have to reload your quiver once in a while.\n+Fast movement and strategic turn-based gameplay.\n+Save feature. You can have multiple saves for multiple characters!\n+Many towns, dungeons and creepy places to explore, and conquer!\n+Can use both keyboard & mouse.\n+Streamlined to play on many computer systems and configurations.\n+Many races & character classes with sub races and classes to choose from.\n+Randomly generated tactical battles and dungeons/maps. Both good & bad!\n+Easy modding support with Steam Workshop integration.\n+User friendly GUI with great explanations of everything!\n+Great little tutorial provided.\n+Cool sound track and sound FX.\n+Smart AI.  Both character and monster AI.  Monsters will hunt you down!\n+Options, options and more options!  The game is completely customizable!\n\nCons:\n-Death comes too easy due to free roam exploration and randomly generated tactical battles & dungeons/maps.  You can encounter areas without warning, where you will die instantly.  Beware of dungeons you cannot exit because you activated a battle with monsters 30+ levels above yours!\n-Randomly generated tactical battles and dungeons/maps. As I said, both good & bad!\n-The game gets a little boring after a while.\n-Once you beat Arena mode, your character is useless.\n-You cannot play the regular game with Arena characters.\n-The price is a little high for an indy game.  I usually get these kinds of games for $1 on my iPad.\n\n\n\nYou can use keyboard, mouse or a combo of the both. There are many key commands which most can be accessed with the mouse too. The keyboard commands are logical choices and easy to learn, but can be remapped to your liking. You'll be using the mouse most of the time though. I have not seen any In App Purchase (IAP) selections or buttons, so I assume most of the content so far is in the game.\n\nTales of Maj'Eyal seems like a nice little game that is very stable and polished with love for the genre. It's old school fun with a twist of 21st century ideas. Being able to set up the game with limited and unlimited lives was a very nice touch and gives the game some options to appeal to many other gamers! You even get your own set of achievements and recognition for playing with limited and unlimited lives! I'm happy with my purchase! :D Happy dungeon crawling! :)\n\nMy system specs are:\niMac, i5 Quad-Core 3.1GHZ, AMD Radeon 6970M 1GB Video RAM, 4GB System RAM, running OS X version 10.6.8.\n\nI rate this game 4 stars out of 5.", "timestamp_created": 1402359419, "timestamp_updated": 1404402680, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500039", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10398442": {"recommendationid": "10398442", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022866997", "num_games_owned": 978, "num_reviews": 65, "playtime_forever": 979, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480798546}, "language": "english", "review": "Quite a fun little title so far - does good things with the roguelike genre without sacrificing depth, difficulty, or fun.

Now, from that roguelike take out the fact that: Potions can kill you, necklaces can choke you, weapons can weld themselves to your hand, Identify scrolls can be burned to a crisp, and you can be violently killed by eating moldy bread :)\n\nWhile I love those type of deaths, once you play ToME and notice that those deaths are not there, you realize now that if you die, it truly is your fault. Death comes from combat (or the occasional sandworm burrow collapsing in on you, haha), and the combat is great.. Almost every single build has multiple ways you can grow, almost to the point that they play like different classes altogether when raised in certain ways.. And then the raw variety of classes is amazing as well.. And the random loot generation is some of the best I've dealt with on the MANY, MANY random-loot games I've played :>\n\nAdd to all that the Infinite Dungeon (how far can you go?), the Transmogrification Chest (all picked-up items rest weightlessly inside the Transmog Chest, and on changing floors you can auto-sell everything out of the chest for a 10% cash penalty, makes inventory management a breeze), a very active and friendly playerbase with in-game chat (its basically an IRC room tacked to the bottom right of the game), the ability to link items and enemies through chat to share the joy of good loot, or the bitter terror of a hyper-strong unique enemy, semi-random in-game events that can potentially save you from the brink of death, and more.. :>\n\nThis game has the most achievements of any game on Steam (over 1000), multiple difficulty levels (some that determine the strength of your foes, others that determine how many lives you get: Roguelike one-life-to-live, Adventure 5-lives-to-live, and Exploration mode, unlimited lives with which you can get comfortable with the game ((or plunge fearlessly into the Infinite Dungeon!)\n\nAnyway.. Try it.. It won't suck out your everlasting human soul, I promise.. It won't.. consume.. you.. GOTTA GO PLAY ToME!

Before you buy the game, though, you should consider whether the Roguelike genre appeals to you because this game is not a typical dungeon crawling RPG like Diablo II.  It seems that most of the negative reviews for this game have come from players who failed to consider their purchase.\n\nThe basic premise of a Roguelike game is randomly or semi-randomly generated dungeons with randomly generated monsters and randomly generated loot.  Luck is an integral part of the Roguelike genre, and most of them allow you only one life.  Skilled players can work with what they're given to create a powerful character, and get through very challenging randomly generated rooms/bosses/dungeons/etc.  Less skilled players might find that they die.  Often.  Tales of Maj'Eyal is unusually 'fair' for a Roguelike game, but you shouldn't mistake that to mean that it's easy, because it isn't easy at all.  It gives you extra lives, and most of the time the monsters are beatable for your level (even if they say that they're a much higher level).  The game even warns you when you're about to open a special room (rooms that often times have very numerous and/or difficult and/or high level monsters) or treasure chest (which usually spawns enemies).  Occasionally you'll run into a very difficult pack of mobs or a difficult boss, and if you lose all of your lives, then you die.  That's life, and that's how the Roguelike genre works.  Hopefully you unlocked something to explore for your next playthrough.\n\nThe appeal of this game is that there is a LOT of stuff to unlock.  You'll find yourself accidentally unlocking new classes, races, and even game modes all the time, unless you're using an unlockables guide, in which case you probably aren't having as much fun as you could be having!  There's also a great amount of class diversity, tons of classes, and even lots of depth within each class.  As a bonus, the game features a really cool world to explore and learn about.  There isn't so much of a 'storyline' but there is really a lot of lore to learn, and there are many things to discover about the current shape of the world, past events, and even letters and such from random adventurers or random people that give insight on a particular dungeon or event.  If you're anything like me, then you'll love that part of the game, but if you're one of those people who never read anything in a game, ever, then that's fine too because you can easily skip lore popups and keep playing.  If these things sound appealing to you, then great, you'll love the game.  If the Roguelike premise doesn't sound very appealing, then you may want to look elsewhere, but don't buy the game and then make a negative review if you can't even get past the first level (also here's a tip: don't play a Shalore on your first playthrough because they have a very difficult starting zone... I suspect that people who found the first level to be 'impossible' probably played a Shalore).\n\nThe UI definitely has its shortcomings, which is probably the worst thing about the game, but all-in-all I think it's a very impressive game for having been designed by one person, and well worth your 7 dollars to buy.

Adding to the strategic depth is the amount of effects the environment can have on a character, from vision blocked by fog to getting crushed by collasping walls to suffocated in water.

The loot system is similar to Diablo and other ARPGs, with randomly generated loot of various qualities and special effects, along with unique loot. The art style is similar to old-school western RPGs like the Spiderweb games. An overworld map contains various towns and dungeons, the latter of which unlock gradually as you progress and complete quests.\n\nNow, the part where this game really defied my expectations is that it provides a very streamlined experience, without a lot of the typical drudgery that goes along with games like this.\n\n- First of all, the game itself is very intuitive to pick up and start playing without needing a tutorial. The interface is mouse-driven, no need to memorize keybinds (although it does offer fully customizable keybinds as well).\n\n- The game seem to understand that the appeal of games like this is both the satisfaction of level progression, as well as the hunt for rare loot. Early on, you get an item that can recycle junk loot into gold, as well as a item with unlimited charges that basically provides a Town Portal effect that teleports you out of the current dungeon. This eliminates the trap that Bethesda games, for example, typically fall into, where you want to be a packrat and collect every piece of loot you come across, but are severely limited in the amount of weight you can carry.\n\n- The game offers several difficulty levels, from unlimited lives, to several lives, to permadeath.\n\n- The game has an \"auto-explore\" button, where your character will automatically move around the current dungeon floor until it finds an item of interest or an enemy.

It's from the less wackyrandom branch of roguelikes so there's less stuff you have to learn by dying constantly and not so many unfair instadeaths. This can be a good thing if you don't like RNG bullshit deaths, but if you enjoy Nethack-type randomness more you might find this game a bit boring.\n\nThe best part of the game is the character development. There's tons of classes and races and while you start with the more usual ones like warriors and rogues, through game events you will unlock dozens more ranging from time-travellers to plague cultists with quite unique gameplay mechanics. There are tons of optional skill trees to unlock through quests so your characters will become quite varied.\n\nMinus points for the completely bland levels, monsters and itemization. There's an ADOM-type overworld map which ensures that not every area is a traditional dungeon, but the levels themselves are just plain boring with no interesting features. Then again the game does have a great auto-explore function so at least you don't have to slog through the dull mazes manually, this is a really good addition, you can fast-forward to the next encounter. Item-wise there are no consumables like the usual potions and scrolls so while it keeps the game less cluttered it also reduces the variety of events and loot a lot. The only items are gear you wear/wield so you can get bigger numbers on your character sheet, sometimes you can get artifacts/runes which grant an extra skill. Simple, but gets grindy and boring. It doesn't help that you mostly have to do the same areas again when you make a new character, they get repetitive.\n\nThis game leans a bit more towards traditional RPGs because the lack of random craziness means that you usually die just when you get too cocky and proceed to a situation you can't handle and on the default difficulty you're allowed to make some mistakes. Characters seem to lead much longer lives than usually in roguelikes and a successful run takes something like 20 hours. I just wish it had more memorable and dynamic areas and enemies, but the class and skill system is still better than in most roguelikes.\n\nWhile there are many things that I don't like and I find the brutal unfair roguelikes more entertaining, I still think ToME is good.

While there IS a mode which allows infinite respawns, it rather defeats the point of the game, which is twofold: \n\n1.) Death is permanant. \n2.) Every world is randomly generated and different. (Within certain parameters, obviously. The Wood Elf's always gonna start in a randomly generated forest area and the Dwarf's always going to start in a randomly generated cave. This is because even the people who made this game realize that it would be a bit absurd to face down a level 1068 demon from hell when you start out in your underpants with a weapon stolen from the toy shop.) \n\nPoor Jimmy the Dwarf Warrior never even made it out of the starter cave. But Mahariel, the Elf Archer chick I've  been running lately has consistently lived over an hour. This might sound a bit frustrating, but it also lends a fresh air of discovery everytime you play. And in that sense, it's probably the standard that all Fantasy RPGs should be held to. Not just indie ten dollar or less titles, but the big A-Listers like Elder Scrolls, Dragon Age, and the like. (If things feel mundane in a FANTASY game, something has gone terribly, terribly wrong.) With minimalist graphics and a shoestring budget, Tales of Maj'Eyal manages to remain engrossing and compelling throughout with evocative music and little smatterings of lore, alongside gameplay that rejects the handholding most games these days embrace. ToME does not hold your hand. It punches you in the testicles. That said, no game is perfect, so here is my criticism. \n\nOne of the general problems with the old school/minimalist vibe they're going for is that your character never really has their place in the world defined. You're just sort of there, playing around in this big sandbox with no real connections to it. You never have an uncle or a sister or a friend or whatever that serves as an anchor. The closest thing you get to party members are ineffective, personality-devoid asshats you have to escort to exit zones in repetitive sidequests you'll never pass up because the rewards are too damned good to turn down. But interpersonal interaction? Forget it. NPCs are just like \"Hey asshole, go do this for the XP and bonuses so you can do slightly harder stuff for the next asshole,\" and you're like \"sure\" and that's that. You just run around going on quests, killing stuff and getting loot because that's how pimps roll, I guess. Of course, one or two half-assed excuses aside, Skyrim isn't much better in this regard, so I suppose it might not be fair to blame the presentation for this. \n\nThe thing is, with all this lore and stuff they dangle in front of your nose, explaining the truth behind the Orc genocide or the politics behind the human-halfling alliance, or the hatreds between the two elven peoples, the fact that none of it really has to do with your interactions with other people, who serve only as quest givers or static decoration, really gives one the off-putting feeling that you have shown up to a party five minutes after it ended. \n\nUltimately, the main character of the game is the world of Maj'Eyal itself and your interaction with it, and it is a compelling world which will be new everytime you play it. The immersive vibe you get from exploring a new bit of dark wilderness or dungeon with moody music playing in the background is excellent, and the lore documents encompass sad, hilarious, and terrifying without skipping a beat. It is a shame that the epic immersion Maj'Eyal offers is strained by the two-dimensional clods who inhabit it, but hey, it's a Roguelike, what were you expecting, War and Peace?

Strikes a perfect balance between usability/user friendliness with depth and complexity. I'll review this game by highlighting what I think sets it apart from other games in the genre.\n\n[b]No consumable items[/b] - TOME doesn't have potions, scrolls, or wands. You choose a limited number of abilities that give you the function that consumables play in other games - quick heal, regen, teleport, blink, fireball, etc. This eliminates the issues lots of people have with hoarding consumables, not knowing when to use them, the pain of having them destroyed, etc. Picking and choosing the right abilities adds a layer of depth that doesn't exist in other roguelikes. \n\n[b]Fast [/b]- this game plays lightning fast and is very streamlined, thanks to the lack of consumables. Of course, it's turn based, so it's only as fast as you want...but I tend to play pretty fast, and lots of roguelikes feel sluggish in comparison.\n\n[b]Broad[/b] - Lots of classes, from your standard mage and warrior to the cool weird things like Chronomancers and Wyrmics (dragon-fighters). \n\n[b]Deep[/b] - The different classes feel distinct. In addition to the obvious (different skills and equipment), different types of classes have different types of resources (mana/stamina/equilibrium/hate/probably some other ones) that work in different ways.  \n\n[b]Combat Is Fun [/b] - This is the only roguelike I've played where melee combat is actually fun. You get lots of buttons to push that do different things. In most roguelikes, the coolest thing about your melee character is the equipment you find. In TOME, you can actually do cool shit - charge, shout, whirlwinds, cleaves, etc. \n\n[b]Simple[/b] - This doesn't mean easy and it doesn't mean shallow - it just means simple. Clean, streamlined design. The action bar is great - every option your character has is on it, so you always know what you can and can't do. No navigating labyrinthine menus, no checking your inventory after you died and remembering you could have used your blink, etc.\n\n[b]Overworld[/b] - Like ADOM and not like Crawl, TOME features a static overworld that's always the same and features the same dungeons/locations, which are themselves randomized. This isn't necessarily better or worse, just putting it out there.\n\nThis game is an absolute blast. If you liked Dungeons of Dreadmor, you owe it to yourself to take a step up to a more serious and more interesting game. :)", "timestamp_created": 1394302028, "timestamp_updated": 1394302349,

What draws me most to this game, honestly, is the depth of customization. Insane amounts of gear, unique skill trees to each talent archetype [20+ different categories (each 5 deep)], and the ultimate consequence of perma-death keep me playing this game. While I'm not really a fan of lore, I can definitely appreciate how much effort the developers put into creating a real atmosphere and background for the game. The tone, to me, is dark, dank... dramatic, and dire; just reading the class descriptions gives one a real sense of purpose for each character.

Do tego trzeba jeszcze rozr\u00f3\u017cni\u0107 naprawd\u0119 zr\u00f3\u017cnicowane buildy jednej konkretnej klasy (grywalne, rzecz jasna).

Naprawd\u0119 bardzo rzadko zdarz\u0105 si\u0119 dwie identyczne rozgrywki, w szczeg\u00f3lno\u015bci, gdy podchodzimy do gry po raz pierwszy.

Wi\u0119kszo\u015b\u0107 naszych zdolno\u015bci i umiej\u0119tno\u015bci zabiera jedn\u0105 tur\u0119 na u\u017cycie.

Ka\u017cdy krok, atak czy cokolwiek co wymaga od nas co najmniej trzech sekund (tyle mniej wi\u0119cej patrz\u0105c logicznie zabiera akcja) jest traktowane jako jedna tura.

Pada nam w ko\u0144cu jaki\u015b przedmiot. I tu kolejny raz musia\u0142em przetrze\u0107 oczy ze zdumienia. Ilo\u015b\u0107 statystyk, kt\u00f3re wp\u0142ywaj\u0105 na nasz\u0105 posta\u0107 jest tak wielka, \u017ce najbardziej skomplikowane MMO na \u015bwiecie (Ultima Online) wzdycha ze wzruszenia patrz\u0105c na te przedmioty. Ok, powiem jak to dzia\u0142a. W grze jest 6 statystyk g\u0142\u00f3wnych, kt\u00f3re wp\u0142ywaj\u0105 na nasz\u0105 posta\u0107. Ponadto statystyki te rozga\u0142\u0119ziaj\u0105 si\u0119 na kilka pobocznych. Opr\u00f3cz tego niekt\u00f3re ze statystyk pobocznych wyst\u0119puj\u0105 jedynie pod postaci\u0105 zdolno\u015bci tudzie\u017c ekwipunku. Gdzie tu skomplikowanie? Wyobra\u017amy sobie przedmiot kt\u00f3ry ma, lekko licz\u0105c, dwadzie\u015bcia r\u00f3\u017cnych efekt\u00f3w, z czego jeden jest jeszcze do tego czarem, np. kul\u0105 ognia, kt\u00f3r\u0105 mo\u017cemy u\u017cy\u0107, je\u015bli mamy odpowiedni\u0105 ilo\u015b\u0107 \u0142adunk\u00f3w w przedmiocie. Niech padnie drugi przedmiot o podobnych statystykach. W tym momencie mamy pauz\u0119 na co najmniej minut\u0119, bo por\u00f3wnanie obu przedmiot\u00f3w troch\u0119 zajmuje. Jest niby wbudowany por\u00f3wnywacz, ten jednak pokazuje nam tylko co stracimy, a co zyskamy. Nie wska\u017ce nam kt\u00f3ry przedmiot jest lepszy, o nie. Gracz decyduje o tym, kt\u00f3ry itens jest mocniejszy, a kt\u00f3ry idzie wek do sprzedania. Je\u015bli do tego dodamy fakt, \u017ce wi\u0119kszo\u015b\u0107 klas mo\u017ce nosi\u0107 co najmniej dziesi\u0119\u0107 przedmiot\u00f3w (niekt\u00f3re wi\u0119cej) + runy zawieraj\u0105ce czary spoza naszej klasy + ogromn\u0105 wr\u0119cz ilo\u015b\u0107 lootu, z czego wi\u0119kszo\u015b\u0107 jest generowana randomowo = godziny kopania w\u015br\u00f3d stert tarcz, mieczy i pancerzy. Niekt\u00f3rych to mo\u017ce odrzuca\u0107, owszem, ale moim skromnym zdaniem lepsze to ni\u017c \"+100 obra\u017ce\u0144, za\u0142\u00f3\u017c koniecznie\" co spotka\u0142em ju\u017c w wielu tytu\u0142ach.\n\nGramy kilka godzin ju\u017c, co\u015b \u017ale zbudowali\u015bmy, albo zabi\u0142 nas boss jakim\u015b wyj\u0105tkowo szcz\u0119\u015bliwym kombosem. Tworzymy now\u0105 posta\u0107, tym razem inn\u0105 i... przechodzimy gr\u0119 bez wi\u0119kszych przeszk\u00f3d. Niestety, ale ToME nie jest zbalansowana. Niekt\u00f3re klasy s\u0105 lepsze, inne s\u0105 gorsze, to normalne, jednak w ToME jest to wyj\u0105tkowo widoczne. Przyk\u0142adowo taki \u0142ucznik. Na pocz\u0105tku praktycznie zabija jednym strza\u0142em wi\u0119kszo\u015b\u0107 potwor\u00f3w, jednak im d\u0142u\u017cej si\u0119 gra t\u0105 klas\u0105, tym jest ci\u0119\u017cej. Owszem, ma bardzo dobry head start, jednak ju\u017c w po\u0142owie gry zdarza\u0142y si\u0119 bossy, kt\u00f3re zabija\u0142y mnie od niechcenia. Z kolei przywo\u0142ywacz [spoiler](swoj\u0105 drog\u0105, jest to najmocniejsza klasa w grze je\u015bli chodzi o end game)[/spoiler] ma problemy z przej\u015bciem pierwszego podziemia, podczas gdy pod koniec gry jest w stanie samodzielnie niszczy\u0107 pomieszczenia wype\u0142nione po brzegi bossami nawet si\u0119 przy tym nie poc\u0105c. Brak zr\u00f3wnowa\u017cenia wida\u0107 coraz bardziej z ka\u017cd\u0105 now\u0105 gr\u0105. Owszem, przej\u015b\u0107 si\u0119 da ka\u017cdym jednym setupem, jednak dob\u00f3r dungeon\u00f3w do naszego aktualnego poziomu czy ekwipunku b\u0119dzie si\u0119 r\u00f3\u017cni\u0107 diametralnie. Ba, pod koniec gry mo\u017ce si\u0119 okaza\u0107, \u017ce najbardziej papierowa klasa \u015bwiata jest niezniszcalna, a nasz dopieszczony do granic mo\u017cliwo\u015bci woj z tarcz\u0105 pada na strza\u0142, bo jedyne co umie, to podbiec i uderzy\u0107.\n\nFabu\u0142a jest prosta jak matura. Z\u0142o zagra\u017ca \u015bwiatu, id\u017a to zabij. Standard. Gr\u0119 nap\u0119dzaj\u0105 liczne sub questy, porozrzucane po ca\u0142ym \u015bwiecie zapiski odno\u015bnie historii Maj'Eyal oraz niezliczona wr\u0119cz ilo\u015b\u0107 easter egg\u00f3w. Dziwnym trafem wi\u0119kszo\u015b\u0107 z nich oscyluje dooko\u0142a uniwersum Doctor Who, mo\u017cliwe jest jednak, \u017ce nie tylko, a ja danego uniwersum po prostu nie znam. Wracaj\u0105c jednak do zapisk\u00f3w historycznych, naprawd\u0119 warto je czyta\u0107. Nie do\u015b\u0107, \u017ce nadaj\u0105 kolorytu temu czarno bia\u0142emu \u015bwiatu, to jeszcze umo\u017cliwiaj\u0105 odblokowywanie dodatkowych zdolno\u015bci, co znacz\u0105co u\u0142atwia gr\u0119. Poza tym czyta si\u0119 je naprawd\u0119 przyjemnie. Tak, zdaj\u0119 sobie spraw\u0119 z tego, \u017ce wi\u0119kszo\u015b\u0107 graczy nie kupuje gry po to, \u017ceby czyta\u0107 jak\u0105\u015b ksi\u0105\u017ck\u0119, ale cho\u0107 raz wysilcie szare kom\u00f3rki, bo naprawd\u0119 warto!\n\nCzas na aspekty techniczne. Muzyka jest przyjemna dla ucha, jednak nie narzuca si\u0119, nie jest te\u017c jako\u015b super epicka. Nie us\u0142yszymy ch\u00f3r\u00f3w ani orkiestr. Efekty d\u017awi\u0119kowe s\u0105 na przyzwoitym poziomie, jednak po pewnym czasie mog\u0105 zwyczajnie nu\u017cy\u0107. Grafika jest prosta, czasami jednak nie jeste\u015bmy w stanie na ekranie zobaczy\u0107 nic przez nat\u0142ok drzew, kamieni czy jakichkolwiek innych udziwnie\u0144 i wodotrysk\u00f3w. Do tego ToME ma uci\u0105\u017cliwy zwyczaj odmawiania wsp\u00f3\u0142pracy i wypierdalania si\u0119 do systemu (dos\u0142ownie. przekle\u0144stwo celowe, bo cholera robi to bez ostrze\u017cenia!) wprost proporcjonalny do czasu sp\u0119dzonego przy grze. Je\u015bli gramy ponad dwie godziny, warto zapisywa\u0107 co wa\u017cniejsze wydarzenie, bo istnieje du\u017ce prawdopodobie\u0144stwo, \u017ce programik si\u0119 zad\u0142awi sam sob\u0105 i szlag trafi nasz progres.\n\nOsoby, kt\u00f3re kupi\u0105 gr\u0119 maj\u0105 dost\u0119p do kilku bardzo przyjemnych aspekt\u00f3w (tzw. donator privileges). Kosmetyczne zmiany wygl\u0105du, nowy tryb rozgrywki \"exploration\" (w kt\u00f3rym nie mo\u017cemy zgin\u0105\u0107. przydatne przy odblokowywaniu klas czy ras) oraz dzielony ze wszystkimi postaciami item vault.

There are a few little things that you get if you purchase it either from Steam or directly from the author though.  But nothing that will make the game any harder.

You can also use auto-explore to go from floor entrance to floor exit and vice-versa when navigating any floors you might have already cleared.  It can be played entirely using just the mouse (keystrokes are still available for most actions and mapped to keys by default but you can remap it all to whatever you want if you like).  You also unlock items that make inventory management easier, which you then will start with from 'birth' on future playthroughs once acquired (example: an item that you get early on during first playthrough which automatically picks up items in any tile that you run over, and anything auto picked up like this isn't counted against your weight allowance; you can take any item out and keep it in regular inventory)  You can use a \"tag\" feature to flag any item with whatever keyword(s) you type in, and the game will not sell/drop the item.  There are no cursed items.  All items are automatically identified once picked up.  You can \"sell\" items anywhere/anytime due to item spoken of above so \"town runs\" are not necessary for inventory management purposes.  There are HELPFUL tooltips for everything that you hover the mouse over.\n\nThere is a very well-done tutorial (accessible during character creation) which explains most aspects of the games' combat/magic system.  There is still a lot of detail left for you to explore/examine/ignore at your leisure/peril, but you're given a good gameplay explanation via the tutorial.  I feel it is worth mentioning and applauding, because unlike other roguelikes I could just start this one up and with the exception of 'dungeon order' (see end of review) I have not felt the need to seek help about gameplay from the internet yet.\n\nYou start the game with a couple of race choices, and a few more class choices (rough mix of melee and magic).  Through gameplay you unlock additional races and classes to choose from in future games.    There is a very high variety of loot, that can give you bonus abilities that are activatable or are used when you hit an enemy, or when you land a critical hit on an enemy (and even more than that that I haven't used yet, I've mostly played the 'melee' side of class choices).   \n\nYou get various ability/skill points per level to assign to 'class' and 'general' skill trees, and a couple stat points per level to assign to your stats like strength, willpower, magic, constitution, cunning, dexterity as well.   Abilties in the skill trees have level and skill point requirements before they can be used, but if you are the min/max type, what is unlocked/available to put points into depends on your stat points from base points and equipment modifies \"at the time you kill the enemy that levels you up\".  This means you can plan ahead and stack your strength skill at level up time by wearing a bunch of equipment with +str on it, if you are playing a mage class but want to put points into a strength ability without sacrificing permanent points, to a degree.\n\nDungeons don't respawn; therefore, \"grinding\" isn't a gameplay consideration.  Dungeons are randomized in layout/monster placement but the monster types within each dungeon are the same every playthrough.  The world map/overview seems to be the same each playthrough but it's a small part of the overall gameplay and after a few playthroughs it's nice to know where the dungeons are each time.\n\nOverall this is a very fun roguelike game that has great replay value due to skill/class/race combinations and the enormous variety of loot drops.  \n\n\nI've added some gameplay tips for dungeon order if you buy or are playing the game, below (credit not mine).\n\n---\n\nBased on the suggestion of someone else I've done the dungeons (after the tutorial and starting racial area dungeon) in roughly this order:\n\nTrollmire 1-3, 4 if you are feeling strong for the final troll boss\nNorgos, then Trollmire 4 if not done yet\nHeart of the Gloom\nKor'pul\nArena\nScintillating Caves\nRhaloren\nLumberjack Village\nAssassin Lord\nMaze\nSandworm Lair\nRuined Dungeon/Golem Graveyard\nOld Forest + Nur\nDaikara\nUrkis\nDreadfell", "timestamp_created": 1391321339, "timestamp_updated": 1391323602, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8934331": {"recommendationid": "8934331", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066586430", "num_games_owned": 291, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 515, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1404577862}, "language": "english", "review": "Harsh, unforgiving, and addictive.\n\nToME is one of the few rogue-like RPGs that gets me frustrated over its unforgiving difficulty and harsh gameplay. And I love it because of it. The game gives a feeling of challenge and forces you to learn all of its mechanics and tricks. Fail to remember any and you will quickly lose all of your lives.\n\nDid I mention that this game is a rogue-like? ToME is a game which has you create your own character picking one of the several races and classes. You can be a human warrior, an elven rogue, or even a halfling mage. The choice is yours. But don't get too attached to your character as they will very easily die. By default, your character is given only a few lives. Run out of them and it's game over. You either have to restart your character's entire story or make a new one. If perma-death or limited lives aren't your thing, there is an option to have infinite lives. But this removes a lot of the challenge in the game and you will not be able to get much of the game's NUMEROUS achievements.\n\nWhile this game has very minimalistic graphics and mostly comprises of still images for characters and objects, it gives a very reminiscent feel of old rogue-like dungeon crawlers. The art-style is a very interesting one but might not appeal to all people. Overall, the game is very well design and made. It has the right amount of challenge and design put into it. The game even has its own lore set and a very interesting world to study and explore. And if you are worried about any lack of replayability, there is a ton of it. All of the dungeons are randomly generated. There are a wide variety of ways to play this game and interesting combinations of characters you can make. And the number of achievements will have completionists at their desks for days trying to get them all. If you feel that the game is lacking a certain something, this game does have Workshop support. So if you wish to make a Vampire race or even make one of the enemy races playable, then you can. This game is very open to mods and highly encourages it.\n\nAll in all, this is a very well-made game that will have on the edge of your seat as you try to keep your character alive.

Game Mechanics are plentiful but they are spelled out and not hidden from the player. User Interface for the most part is easy to get into and use.\n\nThere are a couple of hurdles one will need to commit to however in order to play this game - like any Roguelike there is the overall Game Depth and Learning Curve and Tales of Maj'Eyal is no different. Character skills sort of level up similar to what you might find in an MMORPG or Diablo-like, but skills themselves are also much like their counterparts - not descriptive enough to tell you what they do and requiring you have to test them out or read up on them. \n\nFor people coming from other Roguelikes, you may be thrown off by the sheer Tactical Nature of combat, Additionally it is worth noting that the game is meant to be played in Adventurer Mode - IE, Multiple Lives, not One. Lastly, the game is long - very long. A full run in the original Age of Ascendancy Campaign (The Main Vanilla Campaign that the game started with) from start to actual finish is probably going to be longer then most other Roguelikes bar a few.\n\nAll in all though, this is a very enjoyable game.

Try altering the flow of time as a Paradox mage. A large number of classes, races, and talent categories are available to be unlocked as you play as well.

This is a great way to get some idea of how to play a class well if you don't want to go in completely blind.\n\nClasses aren't particularly well-balanced, but you can be successful with any of them with enough experience playing. The difficulty can also feel a rather inconsistent throughout the game. Most enemies will be trivial to defeat, but then you might be rapidly taken down by a rare monster in a couple turns.

I can say, hands down, that this game is AMAZING! There is an unbelievable amount of content and lore that only keeps growing due to an active modding community and DLC from Dark God. I'm still discovering new, unexplored, areas of the game. I haven't even unlocked all the character creation paths yet. Best of all is the difficulty of this game. Any boss encounter will prove to be a challange, every encounter will become one if you raise the difficulty at all. One word of warning, this game is ADDICTIVE. I literally haven't been able to put it down since the DLC was released. Each class feels completely different. The only true drawback of the game is it's UI. At times the interface can be difficult. Some actions, escpecially in the inventory, take to many key strokes to accomplish. The menu hot keys are oddly selected too. Item information is displayed in a pretty hard to look at format. It seems the game's interface was designed with the keyboard in mind and not the mouse. The item filters need to be more specific. Being able to view the items based on armor type or weapon class would be handy. The hotbars get pretty confusing torwards the end of the game, when your character starts having more abilities than theres convinient room on the hotbar. Two, or more, active hotbars could alleviate this a little. It definitely takes some getting used to to become adept at interfacing with the game efficiently.

I have put more time into this game that I would have ever expected. I actually heard about this game a while ago when it was based in Middle Earth but I never gave it a chance. I missed out. I finally decided to try the free version and I loved it and figured I'd buy it on steam.\n\nFor starters, this game is HARD. If you have never played a roguelike before this is at least more inviting with decent graphics, but it packs all of the challenge. In a roguelike, if you die you stay dead. However, there is a more forgiving adventure mode, and even an unlimited lives exploration mode. In my opinion, exploration mode should be ignored. You need to learn to value your character and every move it makes, and being able to die over and over spoils that.\n\nThe main campaign is long and hard. It has a level cap of 50 which will just barely be reached by some races, and not hit by others due to experience penalties. Don't worry though, those races bring great bonuses along with the penalties. You can be a Yeek, a little while furry creature, and summon other yeeks or move faster than one turn allows. You can be a more traditional elf, summoning trees to your aid, or a dwarf that gains bonuses from hoarding his cash.\n\nHow hard is the campaign? You might die on your first map. You might die to your first enemy, if you're unlucky or unskilled. However, you will get better. Of the starting classes, the berserker has the ability to fight all the way to the end and survive, while learning the ins and outs of the game. The alchemist is much more fragile, but can summon a golem to aid him; it's nice to have a friend along for the tough journey. New classes, races and categories are unlocked by accomplishing various goals, from killing a certain boss to dealing one million fire damage.\n\nThere are abundant side quests, and they offer much needed bonus experience and items. The game has a randomized loot system and powerful uniques, like many modern RPGs. The skill system is deep and rewarding. You will think hard about how to distribute each precious point, and when you die you will look back at where you went wrong and how you can correct it for the next run.\n\nMy first character was a Higher (noble/special human) alchemist, and I died on the second zone that I entered. The enemies were higher level than I was, and it was just the wrong place to be in. Second I tried a Cornac (common human) berserker, and died in the game's final battle. That was a painful loss, but I went back to the drawing board and came in with a Wyrmic; a dragon-based character with the power of nature on his side. This time I made it, and managed to unlock almost everything along the way as well (except for the aforementioned one million fire damage, which took me a lot longer).\n\nThe game is offered for free, with the paid version offering very little additional content. However, I have to strongly recommend purchasing the game here on steam. This game deserves recognition, it's a really great and lovingly crafted roguelike/rpg. The more purchases it gets, the more it will gain prominence and the more work will be done on it.

Knowing what is happening around you at all times is a must in this game, as losing focus of even one enemy can mean death, as I learned the hard way in my most recent death (opened a door, orc necromancer on the other side, managed to escape at first, but on my way back to see if I could get around him, was flanked by his summoned army of skeletons and ghouls). This is a true roguelike, with everything happening in turns as you wander through forests and dungeons, killing everything in your path, picking up loot, buying weapons and armour, and, when you make a mistake, dying with no continues or reloads (at least on roguelike mode). All in all, a really fun game full of challenges and endless replayability. 7.5 / 10", "timestamp_created": 1388477388, "timestamp_updated": 1388477692, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8448010": {"recommendationid": "8448010", "author": {"steamid": "76561197982668260", "num_games_owned": 1172, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 5104, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1419568567}, "language": "english", "review": "Would recommend it to any roguelike fan, but if youre even slightly less hardcore than that then you'll drop this game instantly cause it bears all of the default roguelike flaws like poor balancing of classes (some of them faceroll, some of them hard to survive even on the low lvls), playing boring first lvls over and over again, cause the exploration part is pure trial and error, you can easily get to impossible to beat encounter without any warning, faceroll locations with bosses that will oneshot you, pretty hard locations with bosses which easier than regular monsters (i guess it's overall poor balance and design).

You begin your quest in pre-determined area (dungeon) and after moving through it you get to the world map and are free to go wherever you desire (although you will get killed in most of the places you *can* go). There are several difficulty options to choose from between few extra lives and permadeath. \n\nYou can also unlock new races, classes and quests by achieving different things in-game (no spoilers here) but it will take some time to get to that point since the game is rock hard.

Also donator's characters with custom tiles will show up on the character's vault!\n\nCustom Tiles and Exploration Mode\nExploration mode is basically a game mode where you get an infinite number of lives, for those that want to see the story unfold faster.\n\nItems Vault\nFor each 2\u20ac of donations you gain one slot in the online Items Vault. This allows a character to send items to the vault and an other one to grab it from there. This feature can be accessed through the Fortress ingame.\nStone Warden class\n\nDonators get to enjoy a special class: Stone Wardens. Only dwarves can be Stone Wardens, they are a melee class that dual wields shields and is both proficient in arcane and nature.

It essentially counts the same as if you are a donator on the official web site, giving you the same benefits they get.\n\nAs for the game itself, it is a roguelike. That means randomly generated dungeons, items, monsters, etc... and permanent death. ToME actually has an optional mode where you get multiple lives also, in case you are new to roguelikes and want to ease into things. What ToME does that stands out from the rest is have a very interesting class and race system, which is very customizable to your taste. For example, as a Rogue you can choose to specialize in stealthy gameplay with devastating sneak attacks, deadly traps, or a brawling play style with dirty fighting techniques that give you the advantage when facing foes. The choice is yours, and in addition to stats, each race gives a pool of 4 unique abilities you can also choose to train up, making different race and class combinations play somewhat differently.\n\nAnother feature of ToME that I don't normally see is an overworld system. After clearing your introduction dungeon you'll be thrust out into the open world, free to explore and attempt to clear dangerous forests, dungeons, and hideouts of foes. It makes the game feel large, like your adventures are part of the world of Maj'Eyal and not just isolated to a single deep dungeon.\n\nFinally, ToME is extremely mod-friendly. Don't want to unlock all the classes and races yourself? There is a mod for that. There are mods for new items, new classes, new dungeons, etc...

[b]Dungeons of Dredmor[/b] is one of them, [b]Sword of the Stars: The Pit[/b] is another one.\n[b]Tales of Maj'Eyal[/b] is a roguelike game in it's truest sense, however, it has some gameplay elements that I personally didn't see occuring that much in other RL games like [b]ADOM[/b].\nFor one, there is pretty much no division between activatable skills and magic spells (something like what [b]Dungeons of Dredmor[/b] does). The main difference between them is that different classes use different types of power points (warrior classes use stamina, arcane mages use mana, hate for afflicted classes) that behave differently (mana gets restored with time for magic classes while hate is only increased by hitting hard and taking damage).\nAnother major difference is the absense of magical potions or scrolls. Those are replaced by infustions. A character can store a limited amount of infusions that can be activated any number of times (those can be replaced by new infusions), except that they have a cooldown. This greatly changes the health restoration system other roguelikes and action-RPG games have. Instead of stacking with a huge amount of potions that you drink at will, you have to take note of how much health you have, how much you lose in combat, and how many turns do you have to survive until you can use another infusion.\nThe game itself can be downloaded for free from [b]te4.org[/b].

Then look no further. I've never played a game where you can erase the [b]existence[/b] of an enemy through temporal powers, become a dragon wielding a massive two handed sword with various dragon-breathes, murder people in their sleep (literally), and even create a small undead army at your disposal. \n\nThis game has been carefully crafted in various ways, for one the grind that's in some games is gone in this game, where shops restock only by your progress into the main campain and you later get a item that seperates what you find from your invintory until you decide to put it in your invintory, then, there's the fact that enemies you face have various tactics. For example, a corruptor can conjure bone sheild that negates all damage for 3 attacks! So if you never invested in a way to deal multiple hits with one attack, you'll have a more difficult time! Then the UI and interface is fully costimizable, you can even auto cast spells, such as buffs and take them off your UI!\n\nThere are various items that have unique prefix-suffixs stats and effects attached to them, much like diablo or torchlight for example. Many powerful items are guarentied to drop from a boss, (aka a yellow artifact item) and if the item doesn't suite your need, you can store it away for the next character you make to use! If you don't even want to use that item, then you can convert into not just gold, but into [b]energy[/b] for a special building you acuire. The progession of this game is really solid and at times depend on your race, as some races level up more slowly, but are inately stonger then others. There are plenty of random events and quests that you can undertake, yet they aren't completely random to the point of unfairness.\n\nThe skills and abilities you can accuire are amazing and unique! You can create a [b]gravity[/b] mage, or a invincible sword and board user that utilizes deadly counterattacks, or even a summoner where you can sacrifice creatures for various effects or contorl creatures to make one powerful creature! Then you have player races with unique abilities as well, for example a dwarf can eventually phase through walls, and a ghoul that can basically throw up on the ground that damages enemies and heals you! Last you have prodigies that are power and unique feats you acuire later on in the game, for example you can have a effect where an attack will kill you, but you'll save yourself from death, while slowly losing life to the point where if you don't heal you'll actually die!\n\nThe main story is quite interesting and there's a ton of lore that you'll find and is quite deep. Some of this lore can help you find secrets through-out the world and clear up some of the strangest things you'll encounter... There are various difficulties available, so you can have a more casual experience by not losing your hero after he dies, or a more hardcore one where you have one life to live with stronger enemies! There are also various other adventures you can have, without downloading anything extra, for example you can enter into a arena if you just want some good old action, or if you want to have the old experience where it's just you and a dungeon, then you can enter into the infinite dungeon and never look back!\n\nIn fact, I never looked back after playing this game, and never regreted it.

I have been playing this game since about halfway through its beta, and its truly an amazing game.  Punishingly hard if you are careless, but rewards those who learn to really use the abilities of their character.  And oh, the abilities.  Pick one of the 24 (!) classes (fewer at first--you have to unlock the advanced classes through gameplay; this is a good thing, as you would get slaughtered playing these classes as a new player!) and pick one of the 9 races (again, some require unlocks).  These combine to determine which ability groups you get to put points into.  And points can be scarce--pretty much all character classes can be played 2 or 3 different ways, and some can be done 4 or more different ways, depending upon how you spread your points around.  Add in a mostly-fixed overland map with mostly-procedurally generated dungeons and some tough boss and miniboss fights and an amazingly varied loot system...and you've got a game with frightening levels of replayability.

The fact that races and classes, which are plentiful, are unlocked by completeing quests and achievments is MORE then enough to make you want to play this all night.\n\n I can't think of a single rpg that offers anywhere near the amount of content and playtime for the price.  Playing every race and class and getting to the end game would take months or years.. \n\n Anyone who loves old school RPGs will be very pleased. 9 / 10  (not counting graphical fidelity)  This is pure gameplay my friends.", "timestamp_created": 1387151000, "timestamp_updated": 1387151000, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507515", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8058830": {"recommendationid": "8058830", "author": {"steamid": "76561197973018598", "num_games_owned": 354, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 5965, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1439567061}, "language": "english", "review": "Wow.

You get custom tiles that look cool but really nothing more then just a cosmetic thing. Exploration mode which just gives you infinate lives while nice! it sorta (in my opinion) takes away what makes a roguelike fun and thats perma death. The items vault that lets you share a small amount of items between character, i wont lie is nice but again isnt game breaking what so ever You also get ONE class a stone warden defensive class that only dwarves can use, while pretty nice is just but one class compared to the 26 classes you can already unlock and use in the free versin.  Now about the game itself! This game has a beautiful UI with custom nice looking icons for every thing, a DETAILED and easy to understand leveling system with talent points you can spend on a mix of features unique to EVERY(26) CLASS, a more common tree avalible to other classes, and stat points which you gain every level and distribute as you see fit. There is also a large amount of magical equipment drops with a balenced but wide variety of stats and effects to keep things interesting with your lewt! The best thing i love about ToME is that unlike most other roguelikes there is a variety of places to explore from dungeons to sand caves or  crystal caverns and theives dens! There are many other locations spread throughout the game world for you to find and explore. Some of the places you explore may unlock additional classes/races! did i mention the unlocks? yeah theres a lot and there nice.

The story has since been moved to a new campaign world. Also the classic scroll/potion-mechanic was traded in for a different system of cooldown abilities. Combat was overhauled for a faster streamlined experience -no farming, mobs don't respawn. Good for beginners although hardcore roguelike-veterans might miss typical roguelike chaos. Unlike other roguelikes the number of realistic interactions is low so you will not dip a rod in a potion or throw a ring in a sink here. No need to memorize 10000 key binds. Everything is already identified. The focus clearly lies on fighting monsters and straight action. Complexity is achieved by balancing your equipment, stats, and abilities + tactical fighting + knowing when to fight or run. \n\nSome features:\nThe game is as deadly as most roguelikes however permadeath can be switched off, too. Many advanced races and classes can be unlocked by actions in the game so there is always a reason to start the game anew and try a different combination. There is a built-in chat/news flash so you can read if another player gets wasted, hehe. High-Scores, Mods.

Through your many deaths, however (and there will be many) - you will learn how to survive to the deeper reaches of the game.  \n\nGreat unique classes too.  Many of which are unlike any I have seen in any other game.  If u just enjoy speccing out characters in rpg's and mmo's then this game will scratch that itch too.  Though many of the classes need to be unlocked through achieving things in game in order to play them.\n\nThe game has a free version too, so you can try before you buy.  Buying makes you like a 'donator' and you get extra features like a class and a game-mode that free players can't get.  But you can play for free and still unlock the majority of things.  \n\nI'm buying even though I already have the game and have been playing it for years, just because Darkgod and contributors have put so much good work into the game that if anyone deserves some of my game $, they do.

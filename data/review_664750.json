Sorry to hear you've been having problems. You can always contact me on the forums here on Steam with any problems, or email me directly at info@sludj.com for support.\n\nWhen exactly are you encountering the crash? Does it happen while you're actually in the game, or does it happen as soon as you click to start a new game on the Title Screen?\n\nFirstly, I'd recommend you take a look at the following post on the forum, as that lists the potential fix for the only crash that's been reported so far. Only two people have actually reported a crash, and this has fixed it for both of them so far :)\n\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/app/664750/discussions/0/1519260397790292956/]http://steamcommunity.com/app/664750/discussions/0/1519260397790292956/[/url]\n\nBut here's the short version: If the game crashes on the Title Screen as soon as you click to start a new game, simply visit the Settings > Graphics page first and change all of the graphics settings to \"Low\". Once you've done that, you hopefully shouldn't have any problems.\n\nIf that doesn't help and you're encountering some other kind of crash, please do let me know either here on the Steam forums or by contacting me at the above email address.\n\nThanks,\nJamie\n\nP.S. By the way, those errors logs you mentioned don't actually get sent to me. They're sent directly to Epic Games, the makers of the Unreal Engine (which is what was used to make Wrongworld)."}, "35726182": {"recommendationid": "35726182", "author": {"steamid": "76561198102787134", "num_games_owned": 73, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1227, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512344417}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is a brilliant example of how early access games should be done, the dev is friendly and interacts with the gamers to resolve problems and is genuinely interested in feedback to create the game better.

On the upside after you die you can earn exp and level up which unlocks items that can help you in your next run. \n\nMy only gripe is the combat could be a little better, You can easily stunlock enemies by repeatedly wacking them. \n\nI really hope this dosn't turn into minecraft, Jamie please don't sell wrongworld to microsoft or any other big company because they will ruin it without question. \n", "timestamp_created": 1506341833, "timestamp_updated": 1506341833, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.567130", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "35014892": {"recommendationid": "35014892", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062728030", "num_games_owned": 24, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 379, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505699438}, "language": "english", "review": "Man thi game its fun, so simple yet so inmersive.", "timestamp_created": 1505626602, "timestamp_updated": 1505626602, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34777220": {"recommendationid": "34777220", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079339438", "num_games_owned": 245, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 519, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508659159}, "language": "english", "review": "Simple fun and very rewarding this has to be the way early access games would have gone in the nintendo 64 days.the developer of this game is good with making a game that works well and has things to do in it's current state unlike most games of this type. i know it looks silly but it's quite hard to survive more than a few days here but when you die it's worth it cause the longer you live you get leveled up after you die and get random rewards. i suggest you get into the discussion forums and give the dev ideas he loves to hear them. :)", "timestamp_created": 1504710511, "timestamp_updated": 1504710701, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521739", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34736072": {"recommendationid": "34736072", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016236716", "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2211, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512140961}, "language": "polish", "review": "Great game with massive amount of potential to become even better game but pls change this fart like sound when  Boxy    Macbox is following you ;P", "timestamp_created": 1504535786, "timestamp_updated": 1504535786, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34718839": {"recommendationid": "34718839", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048792690", "num_games_owned": 596, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 290, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504450392}, "language": "russian", "review": "[i]\u041e\u0447\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0441\u0438\u043c\u0443\u043b\u044f\u0442\u043e\u0440 \u0432\u044b\u0436\u0438\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f. \u041d\u0430\u043c \u0434\u0430\u044e\u0442 [strike]\u0448\u043a\u0443\u0440\u0443[/strike] \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a \u043c\u0435\u0434\u0432\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043f\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0431\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0441\u0443\u0449\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430, \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0435 \u043c\u0438\u0440\u043d\u043e \u043b\u0435\u0442\u0435\u043b\u043e \u043c\u0438\u043c\u043e \u043f\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0435\u0442\u044b \u0441 \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043b\u044e\u0431\u043d\u044b\u043c \u0431\u0438\u043e\u043c\u043e\u043c. \u0418 \u0442\u0443\u0442 -

You have to hunt, grow crops, build stuff, and defend yourself in order to survive. Though I've not yet done it myself, I get the impression you can actually build enough cool stuff that you can get off the planet again.\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\nThe graphics in Wrongworld are 3D, with a simple, cartoonish style: low-poly models with sharp edges and brightly coloured, flat textures. It's all done in a consistent style and I have to say that it looks rather nice.\n\nThe days pass quickly in Wrongworld and the day/night cycle is particularly well done. The sun is a great ball of fire that moves across the sky, brightening the world and acting as a proper light source, with great dynamic lighting and shadows. The colour changes at sunset and, once the sun falls to a certain point on the horizon, the day-time sky backdrop is replaced by a wonderful hand-drawn night-time sky full of weird constellations and nebula-like thingies. The moon then rises and also looks rather grand.\n\nThe island has a number of different terrains ('biomes'), each with different trees and creatures, and it definitely looks weird having them all so close together: weird, but cool. The water lets it down a bit, though; something a bit more modern (and transparent!) is definitely needed. The weather effects are a nice touch, but graphically also need work; there's no change in lighting or skybox whether it's bright sunshine, raining, or snowing, and all three seem to be equally common in each biome.\n\nThe animated models really bring the world to life, with crazy-looking creatures -- not all of which are set on killing you -- that ooze personality, and giant comic-like \"Biff! Bam!\" balloons making hitting them feel a bit less like murdering your toys. Your eyeballs falling out of your head and rolling around on the ground when you die is a touch of graphical genius.\n\nThe interface is big and easy to use, including informative and amusing tooltips. There are plenty of graphics settings to play around with; I put them all up to max and only experienced any performance drops when the game was autosaving. It tells you when it's doing this, but I think it needs to run in a separate thread.\n\n[h1]Sound[/h1]\nThere's basically no music in Wrongworld. I think there's a very quiet sort of ambient track that plays throughout, but it's so quiet and unobtrusive that I might be imagining it. The game doesn't feel lonely like some other titles, though, with plenty of sound effects that fit the action well, and nothing that struck me as being too quiet or too loud.\n\nThe crafting sounds are silly, though. Why does cooking something make sounds like you're using hammers and saws?\n\nThere are no voices, though the protagonist does make some cute voice-like sounds.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nThe core gameplay in Wrongworld involves collecting resources and crafting stuff. The more you craft, the better tools you have at your disposal to get more resources and craft better stuff. You have two meters that you need to monitor: health and food. When your food meter hits zero, you start to lose health. When you get hit by an aggressive creature you lose health. When your health reaches zero, you die. You regain food by eating. You sometimes also regain a little health.\n\nThere's no tutorial beyond a few simple tips and loading screens, but that's enough for the basics. You use WASD to move, LMB to attack, RMB to interact, and keys for inventory, crafting, crouching, and jumping. The game also includes controller support, but I couldn't get my XBox 360 controller's 'B' button to work in this game for some reason.\n\nCrafting is simple: just make sure you have the items you need in your inventory and stand near any stationary objects needed for the recipe, such as workbenches or smelters, then hold the interact button. You can collect the basic resources of wood and stone by headbutting trees and rocks, and if you're lucky you might find acorns or seeds to plant, or ore and coal to smelt.\n\nCombat is very simple: attack. You can jump or roll to avoid attacks, but it doesn't seem consistent: sometimes you roll and sometimes you jump. Enemies drop resources when they die, some of which you can't find elsewhere, so combat isn't only important for self defence. It can be a bit annoying, though, as you move with every swing, so attacking a stationary enemy isn't a matter of just swinging away; you have to continually move and adjust your aim.\n\nThe game features some rogue-like elements: permadeath and procedural generation. When you die the game gives you a final score; if it's enough to push you up to the next reward level then the game rewards you with a new recipe that becomes available in all future games. It's a nice draw card to keep playing, and, being a fan of rogue-like games in general, I love it.\n\nThough there's no real background story or introduction provided, the grammar in the in-game tooltips and other text is excellent. There's a great sense of humour that permeates the whole game, too, with some very funny tooltips, loading messages, and achievements, and a general sense of unrestrained craziness throughout. It's really very well done.\n\nThe game is in Early Access and has a number of small annoyances, though I don't think I've encountered any real bugs or stability issues. To begin with, the game seems to imbue objects with a random velocity vector when it first creates them -- such as when you harvest a tree -- and sometimes this vector's magnitude is quite large. Be careful especially when you're harvesting or crafting near water, as I've lost many resources and items from the game sending them flying through the air with considerable speed, straight into the water.\n\nThere seems to be no way to relocate objects that you've built and placed, so make sure you place them where you want them. There's also no obvious way to fill in any holes that you dig unless you have something to plant in them. This makes digging for sand, ice, and other resources a rather ugly proposition. The island also isn't very big, though the developer has already hinted at expanding the game world significantly.\n\nA couple of design decisions are a bit frustrating, too. The inventory is very small and there are no mounts available (though there is a sort of fast-travel system if you have the resources to craft it), so you'll do a lot of backtracking to your camp to deposit resources there and use your crafting stations. Also annoying is that tools such as shovels and axes don't have any obvious wear gauge; instead it seems to be random whether a particular item will break on each use. I've had a new stone shovel break after digging five holes, while my wooden shovel lasted for longer than I did. Health and food can also be quite hard to come by, so you should expect to die early a few times before you get lucky.\n\n[h1]PROS AND CONS[/h1]\nPros:\n+ Solid gameplay and design\n+ Great humour\n+ Personable graphics\n+ Rogue-like elements\n+ Steam Achievements\n\nCons:\n- Island is small\n- Can get repetitive\n- Weather and water graphics\n\n[h1]CONCLUSION[/h1]\nWrongworld is already a very fun game. If the developer keeps on with his plans to expand the game to a whole world rather than just one relatively small island, then it will be even better. If you're into survival crafting games and you can appreciate some weirdness and humour, pick up Wrongworld now. I'm really looking forward to seeing where it goes.\n\nA\n[h1]Save[/h1]\nL\nP\nQ\nR\n\n[code]For more game reviews, visit [url=http://saveorquit.com/]Save or Quit[/url].[/code]", "timestamp_created": 1504095925, "timestamp_updated": 1504095925, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.569369", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34595272": {"recommendationid": "34595272", "author": {"steamid": "76561197973785927", "num_games_owned": 195, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 319, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504043767}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a stylized survival crafting game where you take control of a funny looking creature that I can best describe as an Ewok as imagined in the world of The Neverhood.  The world is randomly generated and death is permanent, so you are always on edge as you travel out for supplies.  Add to that the game throws random natural disaster situation at you reminiscent of Sim City.  In my play through these included huge tornadoes that would follow you around the map, nearby lightning strikes, alien abductions and a meteor shower crashing all around and into my base.  To top it all off you can craft an energy weapon that is essentially (but not!) Darth Maul\u2019s light saber!\n\nCombat still needs a little work.  It's a little primitive, but I wouldn't call it clunky.  It is responsive, it's just that there is no locking onto the target and there is no onscreen indication, such as a crosshair, to tell you where you where you are aiming so it takes a little practice.  The plus side is holding any of the 8 movement directions allows you to attack in that direction, so you do not have to swing the camera around to deal with the enemy if you miss and end up beside/behind them.\n\nAs for resources, there are destructible nodes in the form of rocks to mine for minerals.  You can dig generally anywhere with a shovel to find minerals or plant seeds and nuts.  You can plant crops for a sustainable food source.  You can cut grass for seeds and other plants.  You can cut down trees for wood, seeds, nuts and apples.  Just be sure you stick to full grown trees, as saplings aren\u2019t worth the time to cut down.  Be careful as most actions such as digging, mining and chopping down trees have a chance of unleashing a hidden monster!  You can't let you guard down in this game.\n\nThe land is not destructible and moldable like some games in this style.  Personally, this is a plus for me.  Most non-cube based games I have played which can be manipulated usually result in something going terribly wrong and my base crumbling into the dirt, all for a feature I have no personal interest in.\n\nYou can see my first impressions video and get an idea of the gameplay here:\nhttps://youtu.be/82yefebWN7U", "timestamp_created": 1504059531, "timestamp_updated": 1504113261, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492537", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34592179": {"recommendationid": "34592179", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046484533", "num_games_owned": 165, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2457, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506968198}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10 \nGot killed by a snake with legs. \nWould fight leg snakes again.", "timestamp_created": 1504050132, "timestamp_updated": 1504050132, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.409605", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34543029": {"recommendationid": "34543029", "author": {"steamid": "76561198306524110", "num_games_owned": 22, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1783, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512324954}, "language": "english", "review": "Honestly love this game!

I've got into the habit of smacking them, then backing off and waiting for the NPC to approach me but still I have not been able to get past day 5.\n\n\nCheers, looking forward to updates.", "timestamp_created": 1503621505, "timestamp_updated": 1503670789, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.603060", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34461793": {"recommendationid": "34461793", "author": {"steamid": "76561198127095265", "num_games_owned": 41, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 793, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504371341}, "language": "english", "review": "Pros\n\nMid + Late game is fun.\n\nThe main pro are the crazy exciting events that happen as you play/explore. \n\nExample: Its a fine, normal looking day, you head out and you see some rock-dudes dancing ritualistically in a circle and a beacon of light shining into the sky. \nAlright, thats pretty weird, and you continue your day, thinking nothing of it. You are busy mining rocks to get ore to make an anvil, when all of a sudden, in the distance, [spoiler] A Giant Cookie Monster comes marching towards you, with a deathly aura around it, completely catching me off-guard.[/spoiler]. I recommend not looking at the spoiler if you wanna experience it yourself, but honestly there are many moments like this in the game, where it really surprises you and makes you chuckle and think \"What the hell???\".\n\nFor some of these crazy events, my advice is, fortune favours the bold, but don't \ndo something dumb like charge in without any preparation of course, especially since its permadeath.\n\nLate Game you got many potions to mess around with, you got cool powerful gear to mess around with, I won't spoil it for you though, discovery is the main part of the enjoyment. \n\nCons:\n\nEarly game tends to be boring.\n\nThe first hour it just seems boring, your crafting menu feels limited, you need 30 wood to make a workbench, and thats a lot of grinding to get that, the graphics aren't particularly amazing to keep you engaged, i guess thats why some people dont make it past the first hour. \n\n[strike] Fighting feels clunky, this makes early game fighting, when fists do 5 damage, really tedious. When you have late game items, fighting is a breeze, but early game its simply tedious. A targetting system, so you dont keep missing by punching the air, would make things feel much better. [/strike] Edit: The targetting system has been added. Fighting is better now, there can still be further improvements, but its much better than it was before. \n\nI said earlier the mid game is fun - except the grinding. \nA lot of grinding to get ores to get the crafting upgrades. Perhaps you can make it more rewarding to kill bosses like when killing [spoiler]Giant Cookie Monster, or that Giant Pyramid with Sauron's Eye that spawns snakes[/spoiler], by dropping more ore, so less grinding. \n\nGetting food has a little too much RnG, farming needs to be more sustainable, like larger seed drops after harvest, atm getting enough seeds is annoying. \n\n==========\n\nMy con list is longer than my pro list, why am I giving this a positive review? Because the crazy funny events weigh a significant amount in terms of enjoyment. \n\nAlso, its early access, so you can expect the con list to disappear as the updates roll out. \n\nTo the negative review with under 1 hour, honestly, you haven't even experienced a fraction of the game man, theres a surprising amount of content for you to discover.\n\nIt was just recently released as an early access game, so I can forgive the few unpolished/annoying elements of the game, but with continued love, care and hardwork from the dev, its looking to be a pretty solid humorous survival game.  \n========\n\nI'll update when I manage to beat the game. Uni starts for me next month though so its no guarantee.

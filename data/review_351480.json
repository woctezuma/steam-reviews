It is something you can recreate on tabletop simulator or roll20 and it makes this game less significant specifically due to the poor map quality ect ect.  However, if you enjoy turn based fighters, specifically raising dead units and going to town on the enemy, this is the game to do it on.  I had so much fun playing the necromancer that I wish this game had a longer campaign.

The tabletop-style maps are not fundamentally all that different from the grid-based battlefields of Fire Emblem and XCOM, but I personally got a warm fuzzy sensation from painstakingly positioning my troops where I thought they would be most effective \u2013 plus, the lack of a clearly-defined grid makes human error a more distinct possibility, as there were times when an enemy was able to charge through a gap in my formation that I'd thought I'd sealed up. The fact that each movement can only be conducted in a straight line also forces the player to plan ahead, lest reinforcements end up trapped behind the allies they are trying to save.\n  In my experience, most battles will be decided by a massed melee at some point or other, but the three factions have their differences: the Humans have skilled archers, swordsmen and knights, the Orcs \u2013 who have no campaign in this game, but are available in Replay Battle mode and Multiplayer \u2013 have tough infantry and monsters, and the Undead have a plethora of supernatural units combined with the ability to raise more cannon-fodder from their deceased enemies. In the aftermath, the player is taken to a menu where they can recruit new troops, teach veterans new skills, equip or sell items that have been found or stolen in battle, and purchase other pieces of equipment. The capacity to customise your main heroes is quite extensive, and even your lowlier soldiers can carry a couple of potions, allowing for a wider range of tactical possibilities than I'd originally expected to find.\n\nThe visuals are simple but effective; different units are easily recognisable, and although the animations are pretty basic they get the job done. The tabletop-gaming aesthetic serves a useful function, too: in, say, an Undead-versus-Undead battle, your troops will have different coloured bases from your enemies, so you can distinguish between them at a glance. Age of Fear might not be a treat for the eyes, but it's no eyesore either \u2013 I'd much rather have functional graphics that work reliably than a glitch-ridden mess, and I'm glad AoF has the former.\n\nThe two campaigns each took me around eight hours to complete; the occasional plot-based decision, varying difficulties, hidden secrets and achievements all offer a player excuses for replaying them, if you're that way inclined. As for the stories themselves, the Knight's quest was a tolerable tale of one man and his indignant steed fighting evil wherever he encountered it; the Necromancer's campaign followed the rise, fall, and rise again of an evil mage whose tongue was notably sharper than his wit. Neither story has much narrative depth, but the number of scripted in-game conversations that popped up when various criteria were fulfilled did impress me, even if the actual writing tended to be more 'miss' than 'hit'. To be honest, I was pleasantly surprised to find there were any hits at all \u2013 I like to think I'm a rather discerning fellow when it comes to prose and dialogue, and yet some of these short scenes were endearing enough that they brought a smile to my miserable lips.\n\nOVERALL\nI played through one campaign of AoF, then the other, and then dived straight into AoF2. I think that's got to be worth a thumbs-up, right?

It has what appears to be hand drawn art of all the environments and the characters, and the two campaigns are very fun and quite opposed to one another. On one side you have Knight edward, a young noble trying his hardest to be an outstanding knight, while dealing with unfortunate circumstances as they appear. On the other side you have Necromancer Krull, an apprentice necromancer who starts on his path of evil and villany by murdering some goblins, and then advancing up to massacring entire armes of soldiers, paladins, arch mages and more.\n\nFor the first game in a series of three thus far, it's concept is surprisingly fun, if a bit off with design choices. It proclaims itself as a \"perma death\" game, but on the difficulties I've played (excluding hard and death seeker, I'm not a great player) you're able to resurrect all your troops by the end of combat, provided they haven't in turn been resurrected by a nearby necromancer. At the end of combat you're allowed to run around without a fear for action point consumption, so moving around is fine and even attacking a target is fine, but it's a bit finicky and at the same time you're not allowed to resurrect all the corpses around you for some reason. It's quite time consuming to have to wait for turn after turn to finally resurrect all the nearby corpses as your undead forces.\n\nI do find it very fun, and I'd quite like to get my hands on the second and third games of the series when I can afford it, but this will be a favourite since I'm quite a fan of the necromancer genre, which is oh so lacking in games.", "timestamp_created": 1501555463, "timestamp_updated": 1501555463, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527559", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33893196": {"recommendationid": "33893196", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058607458", "num_games_owned": 111, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 4034, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497210713}, "language": "english", "review": "Truly a great game.

J'ai click\u00e9 sur \"Yes I will write a review\", j'ai eu un message me disant que j'\u00e9tais redirig\u00e9 vers steam pour la poster.... et en suivant un \u00e9cran noir avec rien \u00e0 faire pour en sortir \u00e0 part red\u00e9marrer mon ordinateur, d'o\u00f9 la n\u00e9gativit\u00e9 de ma premi\u00e8re review.\nTant qu'\u00e0 pousser les joueurs \u00e0 en \u00e9crire, \u00e9viter de le faire \u00e0 un stade du jeu o\u00f9 ses qualit\u00e9s n'apparaissent pas vraiment (voir plus loin), et s'assurer que la redirection ne cr\u00e9e pas de bug, seraient de bonnes id\u00e9es.\n\nPlus s\u00e9rieusement c'est pas un mauvais jeu, dans le registre tactique simple (\u00e9voquant pas mal Wesnoth, les hexagones en moins). Et quiconque connait la difficult\u00e9 de produire de bonnes interfaces graphiques en java peut \u00eatre assez admiratif de ce que cette petite \u00e9quipe a r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 faire avec. \n\nLe look du jeu, dessin des unit\u00e9s (peut \u00eatre auraient ils d\u00f9 suivre la mode et se mettre au pixel art pour cacher les lacunes de leur graphiste) etc... et l'histoire plut\u00f4t bateau, agr\u00e9ment\u00e9e d'humour potache et pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e sous la forme de longs wall of text entre deux missions font terriblement amateur mais \u00e7a s'oublie vite car les batailles sont loin d'\u00eatre inint\u00e9ressantes, avec une difficult\u00e9 bien dos\u00e9e.\n\nApr\u00e8s si on compare avec des titres comme Wesnoth justement (qui lui est gratuit), ou plus encore des jeux tactiques plus \u00e9labor\u00e9s comme Fallout tactics, Xenonauts, X-Com, Jagged Alliance, etc... difficile de trouver que les quelques choix originaux d'AoF apportent vraiment grand chose. \n\nLe principal, ne pas avoir de cases, mais avoir des unit\u00e9s qui bloquent le mouvement, m\u00eame des amis, sur une certaine zone, rend surtout les choses plus confuses. Souvent on se retrouvera avec l'impression que 3 unit\u00e9s peuvent attaquer un ennemi donn\u00e9, mais apr\u00e8s en avoir fait attaquer 2 on se rendra compte que leur position bloque l'acc\u00e8s \u00e0 la troisi\u00e8me unit\u00e9. \nQuant aux troupes \u00e0 distance, une diff\u00e9rence de 1 pixel dans leur placement au tour pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent, peut tout changer pour elles, comme elles ne peuvent pas se d\u00e9placer et tirer dans le m\u00eame tour, que leur port\u00e9e n'est pas \u00e9norme (s\u00e9rieusement il faudrait que les r\u00e9alisateurs de jeux tactiques se renseignent sur la port\u00e9e d'un arc un jour), mais qu'elles sont tr\u00e8s d\u00e9savantag\u00e9es en m\u00e9l\u00e9e, leur placement est un casse t\u00eate permanent, mais un brin artifiel je trouve.\nEnfin alors que l'orientation des unit\u00e9s compte pour certaines attaques (backstab) et influe sur le mouvement des cavaliers (ils ne vont pas aussi loin en faisant un demi tour complet), il n'est pas possible de la choisir en pr\u00e9vision du tour suivant, une unit\u00e9 reste juste tourn\u00e9e dans la derni\u00e8re direction o\u00f9 elle se d\u00e9pla\u00e7ait ou attaquait.\n\nFinalement la structure m\u00eame du d\u00e9roulement d'un tour, qui est purement I go you go (je fais agir toutes mes unit\u00e9s puis toi toutes les tiennes) est plut\u00f4t pauvre pour un jeu tactique (pas de syst\u00e8me d'initiative, d'interruptions, etc). Et d'autant plus qu'il n'y a pas non plus de syst\u00e8me d'engagement ou d'attaque d'opportunit\u00e9 (il est possible de quitter une unit\u00e9 contre laquelle on se battait en m\u00e9l\u00e9e, de se d\u00e9placer normalement et d'en attaquer une autre sans aucun malus ou risque).\nEt la structure du tour d'une unit\u00e9 n'est pas mieux (une unit\u00e9 de m\u00e9l\u00e9e ne peut faire que d\u00e9placement puis attaque ou usage de comp\u00e9tence sp\u00e9ciale, pas l'inverse ; une unit\u00e9 \u00e0 distance d\u00e9placement ou attaque). Par rapport aux jeux \u00e0 points d'action comme ceux que je citais plus haut, c'est vraiment tr\u00e8s pauvre au niveau des choix.\n\nTout ceci entrainant un gameplay qui est toujours un peu le m\u00eame aux premiers tours des batailles : on essayera de placer ses troupes juste hors de port\u00e9e des ennemis, pour les frapper en premier quand ils avanceront (et on peut \u00eatre certain que l'IA avancera plut\u00f4t que de faire la m\u00eame chose). \nL'efficacit\u00e9 de cette tactique est d\u00e9cupl\u00e9e par le fait que les unit\u00e9s ont tr\u00e8s peu de points de vie (le soldat d\u00e9butant humain ou gobelin de base en a un et fait un point de d\u00e9gat), en pla\u00e7ant bien ses troupes pour agir en premier il est souvent possible d'\u00e9liminer directement un paquet d'ennemis sans r\u00e9plique. \n\nLe gros de la difficult\u00e9 devient d\u00e8s lors de r\u00e9aliser ce placement offrant un \u00e9norme avantage au joueur dans un syst\u00e8me sans cases (de mettre au pixel pr\u00e8s les unit\u00e9s l\u00e0 o\u00f9 elles doivent \u00eatre pour avoir un bon choix de cibles au tour suivant sans pour autant s'avancer trop ou bloquer les autres). Ce n'est pas toujours \u00e9vident mais pas vraiment un type de difficult\u00e9 faisant appel aux qualit\u00e9s strat\u00e9giques du joueur.\n\nApr\u00e8s les choses commencent \u00e0 changer apr\u00e8s 6 ou 7 missions, et les nouvelles unit\u00e9s, comp\u00e9tences, sorts, objets, ennemis, etc... d\u00e9bloqu\u00e9s avec l'exp\u00e9rience rendent le jeu bien plus int\u00e9ressant que les premi\u00e8res escarmouches le laissent penser (et le fait que les unit\u00e9s exp\u00e9riment\u00e9es sont plus solides rendre l'avantage de qui frappe en premier un peu moins \u00e9norme). Mais la base du syst\u00e8me demeure un peu faible je trouve.\n\nA l'arriv\u00e9e c'est un jeu, dont on peut certainement tirer quelques dizaines d'heures d'amusement, si les toutes premi\u00e8res ne m'ont pas fait un effet fabuleux. \nMaintenant comme jeux tactiques, m\u00eame dans une gamme de prix modiques, il y en a un certain nombre que j'aurais tendance \u00e0 recommander plus que celui l\u00e0 \u00e0 des amateurs du genre (par exemple en TRPG Low Magic Age, qui lui a un syst\u00e8me d'initiative et d'attaques d'opportunit\u00e9 ;  et ces bons vieux Fallout Tactics, Jagged Alliance, Xenonauts et autres titres anciens cit\u00e9s plus haut, qui eux ont des d\u00e9cors destructibles, des points d'action etc...). \nQuant \u00e0 AoF je le ferais plut\u00f4t \u00e0 quelqu'un cherchant sp\u00e9cifiquement un jeu tactique minimaliste ou d'initiation, \u00e0 la prise en main vraiment tr\u00e8s simple (certainement c'est une bonne option pour qui aurait peur de se perdre dans la multitude d'options et les r\u00e8gles complexes des autres jeux tactiques), dont la richesse ne se d\u00e9voile que petit \u00e0 petit, laissant le temps de l'assimiler.", "timestamp_created": 1498304978, "timestamp_updated": 1498386931, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32684383": {"recommendationid": "32684383", "author": {"steamid": "76561197968907104", "num_games_owned": 547, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 703, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498468026}, "language": "english", "review": "A really good turn-based tactical combat game with a small equip/level up/shop system layer in-between, definitely worth its price.\n\nThe story is - though a bit clich\u00e9d - surprisingly interesting and told by a fully voiced narrator.\nThe combat is challenging and quite a lot of difficulties and options are available to the player.\nYou can customize your ever-growing army before (almost) each battle, so there should be something for each play style.\n\nNow, obviously, this game was made on a budget.

A major con is that you are only able to move in a straight line, thus you are not able to get passed a unit and subsequently change direction and get behind his back within one turn.

The progression system also feels well done and gives you the ability to fine tune your troops to handle special roles.

It's like playing a tabletop wargame on the PC.  You have a puny force of troops pitted against overwhelming odds and you have to tactically maneuver your way across the battlefield to survive.  Closest existing game I can compare to is the Fire Emblem series but the rules are a lot more like your typical hobby shop miniatures game.  There are dice rolls, linear movement without a ruler, simple stats, few abilities, limited debuffs, only a few health points per troop, everything is kept super simple and obvious so you can understand what's going on across the entire battlefield simultaneously.  This isn't one of those Civilizations turn-based games that will information overload you.  It's easy to predict and understand how a fight will go between two units and I found Ogres scary before ever fighting one just by looking at the stats!  Yet likewise I understood exactly how to beat one just by looking at their abilities versus mine.\n\nThis is more about understanding your army and keeping units alive.  If you've played turn-based games like Valkyria Chronicles or XCOM then you should enjoy this.  There's even an ironman mode that prevents save scumming so you have to know how to keep your troops alive.  Since there's no way to farm gold between missions you also have to manage your expenses and not blow too much gold too quickly on units or items or potions.\n\nGreat game!

I haven't had this much fun playing a tactical, turned based RPG in a long time.  It seems that with modern technology, most developers have lost that charm that RPGs used to have in the 90's and early 00's.  What I love about this game is that you have to think and plan before you make your moves and this game can be a challenge at times.  Especially when you choose the harder difficulties.  This game does have a simple in game tutorial to get you started, but it doesn't hold your hand like so many modern games do.\n\nYou can choose sides which consist of the Undead or the Knights, so there are two separate campaigns.  So far I beat the game doing the Sir Edward campaign and I'm definately gonna try out the Necromancer campaign next.  Your main character (hero) is in charge of your own little army of recruits which can be up to 16 units  (Size of army is dependant on level).  With each successful battle you and your army gains XP which can be traded in for new skills, spells, or attribute point increases.  \n\nI've been a hardcore RPG fan since the mid 90's and this game is a hidden gem.  I haven't binged on an RPG like this in a long time.  It can be very addictive.  It has that old school RPG charm that cannot be replicated in modern AAA games.  On the surface it may seem simple, but once you get into it, you realize how complex the game really is.  This isn't one of those games where you beat it once and you never play it again.  This game you can play again and again.  I've put about 10.5 hours in and I've felt like I've only scratched the surface.

Because this, is, it. Most games don't have an AI that can see through my attempts to lure, know which of my units to target first and how to target without suffering serve losses, or that can beseige defenses that would give veteran players a hard time. And on the harder difficulties these traits can actually give a challenge without giving the AI any special bonuses. \nHowever if you are worried about that making the game too difficult then fear not~! For the game is fairly simple to understand; where the complexity lies is in how to best use your units to out smart the AI. (Which the AI knows how to put to good use of their units.)\n\nSo how does the gameplay actual flow?: for the most part you will probably be playing the campaign, which in this AoF1 (This game), which you can choose from humans or the undead. (In AoF 2 you can pick between Demons and orcs, same engine too.) You are given a finite amount of units which depending on your faction have their own roles and quarks similar to chess pieces, however unlike chess, you will be moving units rather freeform state with turns. (Like a general moving units around on a map.) So basically it is like a strategy where you can move units around fairly freely with a few exceptions; the units not being able to magically stand on each other (I am look at you Starcraft), that this takes place in a turn-based style, and a unit can't move through another unit even if friendly.\n\nOkay, as a reader you are probably wondering what kind of bad things this game has, so I will take a break from that to provide you with [b]The bad.[/b] \nFirst off, this game is made by a poor indie development team who works on the game in their spare time; what that means for you is this: they don't have the money for fancy animations or voicing everying, they can't provide the game with time required to properly optimize the game so the game can require you fiddling with options till things run smoothly as you want, and other small polish related things.\n\nWith all that out of the way, I must contridict it a bit. While the developers don't have money for nice assests, they haven't stopped updating the game, and have recently redone the terrain quality from being just passiable to good quality. They are constantly improving the game in their spare time, they have introduced two new systems within my time of owning the game. (AoF 2, both games share the same engine, and are typically updated at the same time.) The two new systems being morale, which makes the combat ever so much more satifying and adds a new dimension to play, and  the other which probably isn't a new system but rather a constant and frequent additions and updates. Which brings me to my next point...\nOne of the Dev's is a user, just like you :p , name Les that has a tendency to fix any problem as soons as I or someone reports it, answer questions sometimes a few minutes within posting; sometimes even launching an update as well if it can be addressed quickly. (Yes I have seen the game get updated several times a day, yes some of those may or may not have been my fault. )\nI am probably forgeting something else that is nice but since it wont probably pop into my head today or tomorrow lets wrap this up with a nice bow, even if it comes without packaging paper.\n\nTL;DR:\nPros:\n-Amazing AI that is plays like a player\n-Devs actually care about the game, and are still constantly improving it\n-Simple to learn but feels good to master gameplay\n-Great AI, yes I really like the AI, it deserves to be two bullet points.\n\nCons:\n-Lacks polish\n-May run slow\n-Poor indie dev problems (Because money doesn't grow on trees, and it does buy nice things)\n-Game can have some wierd problems such as sound not working. Consult either the steam forum for the game(s) or Les\n\n\nSo why do I have the product recieved for free box checked?\nProbably because I did recieve it for free... Les has been on my friend's list for since I about a week or so after I bought AoF2, yes I played them out of order and no you wont miss anything too important like this; most of the time I use this as a means to provide feedback on new features, or bugs I may come across as I find them. Since he often can either say whether it is a problem or that he will fix the problem shortly. Which he has oftenly done so. Additionally I tell him about about my attempts at the hardest difficulty \"Deathseeker\" and my attempts to win unwinnable battles, okay you can win them, it is just neither expected and very hard to do so. And things get really hard at that point. I am not sure if he likes me giving reports on how I try to destroy an overwhelming dwarven force with an AI that can often think out steps better than I can, but I pretend he does if he somehow doesn't, mostly because I think I would care. I probably should let that unwinnable battle be a loss and just finish the game on deathseeker difficulty... *Continues her rants about fiendishly armed dwarves and the struggle her demonic army face.*", "timestamp_created": 1477618297, "timestamp_updated": 1477618297, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.566502", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26217402": {"recommendationid": "26217402", "author": {"steamid": "76561197974493059", "num_games_owned": 332, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 2199, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477407929}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is essentially a turn-based, tactical combat simulator with unit recruiting, leveling, and transformation as units get experience and more advanced units become available as the campaign advances. The campaigns are fairly short, each can be completed in 6-12 hours (depending on how fast you play). Combined the two campaigns provide plenty of content to get your money's worth. I found the game fun because the combats are generally fun to play out, there are enough different unit types, ways to level up or transform your units, and different ways to build your team that it stays interesting throughout. \n\nWhat it doesn't do well are the bells and whistles. There's a story, but it's only text and it's pretty thin. Definitely don't buy this game for a good story. This is not a CRPG, it's a tactical combat similator. The graphics and sound and bad.

The campaign alternates between telling the story through text dialogue, and then tactical turn based combats.  the combat system is actually quite good, and lends itself to multiple ways of conquering your enemies.  Use blockers and magic or ranged attacks, or rely on crushing melee charges to disrupt your enemies formations, eschewing the ranged attacks for more risky but often quicker victories.  Some enemies have resistances to certain attacks; for example,  skeletons are highly resistant to any standard ranged attack, so require alternate strategies to deal with them.  necromancers can hang back and continue raising their own dead (or the enemy's!), or use their powers to manipulate the tide of battle dirrectly.  Lots and lots of choices, which makes replayability rather high.\n\nThis game is also extremely easy to mod, and even includes a basic map editor.  The unit files and campaign files can be easily extracted from the main .jar files using winrar, and are basic text files that can be edited in any ascii editor like notepad+, and then re-compressed into the main game files.

It has some RPG elements and a unifying story for each campaign, along with the occasional text adventure-like choice to make. The battle system is strong and well balanced. The game is not hex-based and allows for free movement. It takes a bit to get used to how you can effectively use melee units to block access to your ranged/spellcaster units, but once you get the hang of it, it is a thing of beauty.\n\nAs a single-player game I found it a bit short; I finished the campaign in about 15 hours on Normal.

More judgement than normal is needed to get the balance right between protecting your ranged units while not using such a tight formation that you hamper manoeuvrability.   The unit progression system is great; with individual named units you can upgrade over the course of the campaign. The best thing about the game is probably how all the elements cohere together.  The simple yet nicely plotted story. The primitive but often authentic sounding medieval music, which changes nicely to fit the mood. Basic yet well chosen ambient sound.

For me, I had a lot of fun. Like they say, don't judge a book by it's cover. This game is deep and can be difficult.\n-The girl from the trailer is not in it.\n\nPros:\n-Unit management and advancement requires you to make smart choices in order to survive. You may get to the point where if you've made poor choices, you can't go any further or you lose the level and have to go  back to a last save. \n-Good story. A little minimalist, but again, this game is all about the game play.\n-Varied and balanced unit compositions. You won't get to the last level and not lose a guy.

The bowman is one exmanple, you have priests and mages(with upgradeble spells besides the other perks), knights melee infantry units. mass stone skin, an upgrade for a mage spell, rocks(pun intended). So you can see that if you can keep your units alive for a while they are gonna kick ass.\n\nthe story is amazing, wont get in too much detail, but if you like to read(story is presented through text) you are gonna find yourself really immersed in the tale you are living. And there are 2 of them in each game. I know my retinue by name, i know i promissed the father of one of my infantry guys i would keep him alive, and i\u00b4ll tell you, this really wheights in my decision when considering which units to risk. when i realized that I was caring this much for the characters and the story I knew this game was a finding.\n\nWhat is left to add is what a nice and attentive guy the developer is. he aswers to all my questions, reply to all my ideas, just check other reviews or discussion threads to see how perfectly he handle even criticism from people who are expecting CoD graphics and can\u00b4t enjoy a great game with minimalist graphics, which are not ugly at all btw, i really like the way the game looks, and sounds.\n\nIn short, Buy it!! if you are not in love with the game in the first couple hours you can always get a refund.", "timestamp_created": 1452553214, "timestamp_updated": 1454259524, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.589363", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20412021": {"recommendationid": "20412021", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062232099", "num_games_owned": 5076, "num_reviews": 283, "playtime_forever": 334, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451918733}, "language": "english", "review": "Let\u2019s get one thing perfectly clear straight away. You\u2019re not going to be pouring hours upon hours of game time into Leszek Sliwko\u2019s fantastic Age of Fear series because of breathtaking graphics and incredible surround sound. The game simply lacks that. So if you\u2019re a graphics and sound technology whore who has little appreciation for other aspects of games then you\u2019re going to want to turn away now and find a game geared more for you. I personally found that the first Age of Fear game to be a fantastic game crying out to be played. It will hold incredible appeal to those of you who appreciate great game play mechanics and those of you who have a likening to well thought out strategy games that begin simple enough to allow you to learn the basics before gradually increasing the difficulty and mechanics of the game to the point that you\u2019re enveloped in the games cocoon.\n\nThe game\u2019s greatest strength is its AI. Many people could take pages out of Sliwko\u2019s book on how to program artificial intelligence, well, intelligently. Many games of this nature fail miserably because the computer is not programmed to play smartly with the game often boiling down to understanding the basic idiosyncrasies of the game before they become a cakewalk. This is simply not the case here. The strategy required to be successful starts outside of the battle. You must select your troops and then evolve them \u2013 upgrading their talents and abilities \u2013 correctly to enjoy sustained success. Otherwise you will find that you are obliterated. The game\u2019s AI is smart enough without the necessity to cheat.\n\nThe most significant weakness of the game was the, in my opinion, silly and unnecessary point to make players search for treasure chests after successfully winning a battle. I tried this a couple of times following fights but it is a tedious process that is unnecessary and takes away from the game\u2019s strengths. This isn\u2019t a hidden object game it is a turn-based strategy game where the aim of the game is to defeat your enemy and move onto the next round. While you do not have to find these extra chests it would have been much better to give them to the player for completing the battle or having a random dice roll or something based upon how well you did in combat rather than asking the player to spend extra time on a map following a fight.\n\nAge of Fear: The Undead King is not going to appeal to everybody. However, to those who enjoy it there is a likelihood that you\u2019re going to find yourself returning to it again and again.\n\nFor more reviews similar to this one and our daily giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com/", "timestamp_created": 1452310408, "timestamp_updated": 1452310437, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.612714", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20378574": {"recommendationid": "20378574", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060947404", "num_games_owned": 1081, "num_reviews": 46, "playtime_forever": 335, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452194869}, "language": "english", "review": "To be honest I'm a bit torn, I really enjoyed playing this game so I guess I'll recommend it.

But. Trying to give AoF a thumbs up or down is like tossing a coin in the air and having it land on its edge instead of heads or tails. It has its good points and bad. The storylines are pretty decent, the background artwork is very nice, the combat is okay but nothing truly innovative. Most gamers will get through the \"good\" campaign without too much difficulty on the standard setting. But it's when you attempt the dark or \"bad\" campaign that things become both better and worse. This is because the necromancer plays very differently, has a completely different skillset, and a level path that requires you to take a different but fairly specific approach. Unfortunately, this is where the RNG hits you hard and you will find yourself having to replay levels over and over just because you had bad luck with the rolls or completing them with ease because you got repeatedly lucky. As much as I'm enjoying this game and as much as I wouldn't call it a bad game by any stretch I'm going to push that coin over onto whichever side represents a thumbs down for the simple reason that there are better games in the same pricepoint - specifically Telepath Tactics. This said there's plenty of fun to be had here if you arent too picky. As is often the case I would rather have given this a more neutral vote but there we go. If you grab it in the sale (as I did) you'll likely be happy enough. It's also worth noting that the lead developer cares very much about his games and is very keen with responses to issues in the forums and continues to patch them when he can.\n\n*edit* Recent updates have done more than enough for me to flip that coin back the other way and the game is now well worth its full cost.", "timestamp_created": 1451908837, "timestamp_updated": 1454131595, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.542592", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20224232": {"recommendationid": "20224232", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025697128", "num_games_owned": 1496, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 1045, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1448315740}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]Disclaimer:[/h1]\nI have not played AOF2 since Nov. 2015, thus some points I put here might be dated since devs are constant improving the game. I'm writing this review after such length because I feel I have the obligation to let more people know what this game is good at, to let more to see its great potential as an indie TBS.\nAlso, as my first language is not English, expect mistakes, misuses and Chinglish and I apologize in advance. I'm writing this in English because review in English will not be filtered. Yes, simple as that.\n\n[h1]TL;DR version:[/h1]\n+decent TBS\n-minimal graphic and music\nPersonal Verdict: Recommend\n\nAge of Fear (AOF and Age of Fear 2 will be refereed as AOF2) came later on Steam than AOF2. However, note that its development was prior than AOF2, so you can understand some drawbacks compared to its squeal.\n\nThey are:\n[list][*]linear campaign. Unlike AOF2, you don't get to choose your path here. This is a minor issue that you need not to complain about, i am just pointing out for you to see.\n[*]Worse performance issue. (Note that I've not played AOF and AOF2 for awhile, it's based on my poor memory) AOFs are developed in Java, which is universal but also somehow primitive. Les (dev) said that he is working on geometry engine and native library in order to boost AOF2 experience, and since update for AOF2 and AOF are basically synchronous, so expect this problem to be eased in the near future.\n[*]less minion diversity. There are, indeed, many different units just like in AOF2. However, their functions don't differ decisively and one often overlaps with another, and some are thus pretty useless.[/list]\n\nOkay, pretty much for its inferiority compared to AOF2. What it's good at, same as AOF2, is:\nGreat turn-based strategic combat. \nUnlike many other TBS games, in AOF series unit size can greatly influence the pace of the battle, and there are no tiles to limit your movement so that you can micromanage your unit position. Unit deployed can block others behind them and affect their movement significantly and hence, when and which unit you gonna move is important, so that you don's screw up. e.g. you may want to have a necromancer to move forward to raise a corpse, but to do so you need to have it exposed to enemy melee units, and you can't get your, say, ghoul, that would originally be behind the necromancer to cover him because it's path is blocked. So it would be up to you to decide, whether to expose a necromancer to fatal peril, or to delay or even abort your plan.\nAction per unit allowed executed per turn is limited. It's majorly against casters are ranged units. Most of spells are not allowed to cast after moving and ranged attack the same, and thus you will have to arrange your squad position carefully that your shooters can cover the desinated battle ground, your mages have your targets in spell range and your tank units can cover them, not to leave them to assulters like riders, so that all departments of your army are fully functional. \n\nThe drawbacks for AOF and AOF2 in common are:\n[olist][*]Very minimal graphic. But it doesn't matter.\n[*]Music is limited. But it doesn't matter as well.\n[*]Performance issues as noted above. It does matter, but dev is working on it.\n[*]Weak story.\n[*]Minor spelling and grammar mistakes.[/olist]\n\nAbove, I recommend AOF. I would say this is an exemplar of how to make an indie TBS: Decent combat, deep strategy. I see some developers put money in fancy graphic and impressive music but the game itself turns out to be crappy, what a waste. Then I wish some people can have more budget to further polish their game. Like this.\n\nYou may want to pick up AOF2 and see if you like it, since they don't share a coherent story.

Graphics are functional top-down 2D graphics, which I thought were decent. Play choices outside of combat are about choosing which types of comrades to join your group, and how to develop their abilities as they gain experience. I didn't see any choices outside of combat, party composition, which special items to give to which characters, and which skills to improve with experience. So it's really a series of tactical battles with text and party management between battles - no other choices, no exploration, etc. Difficulty levels range from easy to Death Seeker. \n\nI bought it and played only on Death Seeker, because I'm hard core that way - er, actually because I like permadeath and permanent crippling wounds to happen - I might rather have played on a somewhat easier difficulty level, as I ran into situations I failed to overcome (since I accepted defeat and don't savescum). It could be seen as a problem that Death Seeker seemed not terribly hard but then led to a VERY difficult encounter, but if a player doesn't mind re-playing such a scenario, the game does allow shifting the difficulty up and down during a campaign.\n\nOverall I recommend the game if it's a type you might like, as the type of game is one I like a lot, and I mostly enjoyed the content. There are some things I would rather worked differently or were improved, but I'm an old-time gamer with refined tastes.\n\nThe Good:\n* Turn-based tactical combat with some interesting and semi-realistic elements, combined arms tactics, etc.\n* Fun to try to keep men alive and develop their abilities.\n* Ability to try various tactics, group types, and different character abilities.\n* Variety of tactical situations and opponents.\n* Well-written story linking the battles, which gives content and makes sense. (Few typos considering the devs are not native English speakers.)\n* The developers are steadily improving the game and they listen to player feedback - a formula which leads to some of the best games, in the long run.\n\nThe Medium:\n* If you're spoiled by graphics made by corporate games with million-dollar budgets, these are as seen in the screenshots. I thought they were fine.\n* I could wish for various improvements and changes to the combat system, but again I have rarified tastes. I like it more than 95% of computer RPGs, so it would seem somewhat silly to complain. With devs like these who listen, the thing to do is send them your suggestions, so I did.\n* I saw no option to turn off the random character voice comments when moving each unit, without turning off all the ambient sounds. I grew tired of those voices after a while. P.S. As you can see in the comments, this is an example of something the devlopers are listening to and will be an option to turn off in the next version!\n\nThe Bad:\n* Nothing I'd call bad.", "timestamp_created": 1446708120, "timestamp_updated": 1446756133, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499785", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18842637": {"recommendationid": "18842637", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001784686", "num_games_owned": 274, "num_reviews": 67, "playtime_forever": 907, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476605173}, "language": "english", "review": "It's not some play for 1000 hours game but for the price I like it as it's a nice little game to take a break from the big ones with.

Since then it seems to have gone through multiple changes which reportedly added more RPG elements, slightly improved the graphics, and repeatedly improved the balance and fun factor of the campaigns and multiplayer.\n\nEven based on that old version, though, Age of Fear was already one of those indie diamonds in the rough, and one I could easily recommend to any fan of tactical games. It features two decently sizable campaigns (a 15-battle Human campaign and 14-battle Undead campaign, each with one secret, hidden battle) for singleplayer, as well as a multiplayer skirmish mode which I never tried out, a well-told - if not always the most well-proofread - storyline if you're up for reading huge blocks of text, and a fairly decent AI to test yourself against.\n\nAge of Fear isn't a game for those who need everything to be polished and shiny, because it's ... basically the opposite of that, but if you're willing to put up with occasional typos, fairly basic art, and a few quirks and idiosyncracies, I have to strongly recommend it.\n\n(My time is very low because, well, I just wrote this review based on the old versions I played when I beat the game, which were around 1.2-1.4. I need to play it again eventually now that it's got the RPG systems implemented.\n\nEDIT for 2017: It now has even more new stuff and I haven't played it again yet.

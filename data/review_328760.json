To be real: It was less than a dollar and I was feeling frisky. But after 70+ hours of playing this game, my thought is that the sale price is an insane steal. For the hours of entertainment and enjoyment that I've received from this game, I think the full price tag is worth it and I feel almost guilty for paying so little for a game I love so much. But hey, if you see it for 90% off (like it is RIGHT NOW... at least at the time of writing this) I fully recommend picking it up. That's value.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nSanctuaryRPG is a text-based roguelike RPG where you choose from six different classes (each with their own strengths and weaknesses) and grind your way to gain levels and find gear. The premise itself is standard, but there is enough depth to the ways one can create their own character builds that make each new game exciting. \n\nThere are four game modes: Classic (permadeath), Softcore (respawns), Lunatic (go fuck yourself), and Survival which is unlocked through beating the game on the other modes. Most of my experience is playing on Classic, though, I had the unfortunate idea to try playing on Lunatic mode and well\u2026 this game is out to kill you. There is no hand holding. You are not safe. Encounters, like most things in this game, are randomized. In the same area that you\u2019ll find a mob that you can one-shot with ease, you will find something that will blind you and force you into a war of attrition before slaughtering you. \n\nThat sense of unease and fear can be a lot of the fun of this game though. It sucks to die after thinking up a new build idea and finding the perfect items (which are all RNG drops) to make it work, but there\u2019s some charm in this game that has me throwing more and more attempts at it without ever feeling like it\u2019s pointless. The combat is easy to learn and get into so starting fresh never feels like too much of a drag. \n\nThere are definitely some annoyances: because random is well\u2026 random, you\u2019re prone to legendary drops that you\u2019re forced to throw away because they have worse stats than some common sword you found at the start of the game. Crafting can sometimes feel pointless because the items you make are just as random as anything you can find from killing mobs (though it is an extra chance at loot). And the inability to hold any armor/weapons besides the ones that you are wearing can feel incredibly frustrating, though, it does make one more mindful of the gear they choose to pick up and forces the player to play and build around the items they find (which can make for some interesting characters).      \n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\n\nThe ASCII-style art of SanctuaryRPG is one of the features that initially stood out to me when I purchased the game and are one of many things that make the game unique. There is a lot of variation in characters, mobs, and environments that is achieved perfectly in this style and are well made. It serves to capture the setting and tone of this game which is very old-school and quirky. \n\nIt\u2019s definitely a matter of taste. The screenshots give a good idea of what this game looks like (though, there are some very nice pieces of art that one gets to view as they progress through the story). Some people may be put off, but this game has its own niche that it fills and the ASCII-art continues that theme and charm. \n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\n\nAnother fun part of SanctuaryRPG is the writing and the tone and universe it is set within. There is a lot of comedy throughout the game: a lot of silly and random (like the gameplay itself) events that have you milking ghosts, stealing weapons from hobos, or eating flying pancakes. Even in the creation of your character alone you are given an elaborate randomized backstory that sets the fun and humourous tone for things to come.\n\nThat said, SanctuaryRPG isn\u2019t devoid of a narrative and it isn\u2019t solely lolsorandom humour (not that I minded the more lighthearted parts of the game anyway). The main plot of the game, while seemingly standard, has your character fighting through places of the world and discovering more about its lore and people.Though, there aren\u2019t many huge plot twists that will keep you awake at night or any moments that will elicit intense emotions. \n\nThe story gets the job done and there\u2019s enough intrigue to keep you wanting to get to the end, though the worldbuilding is what I\u2019d consider a stronger element than the plot itself. This game has an interesting setting that feature both dragons and low-technology weaponry alongside robots and portals. It feels like its own unique setting and while it does borrow many classic RPG tropes, it arranges them in fun ways that allows the setting to stand out on its own.\n\n[h1]Music[/h1]\n\nSactuaryRPG\u2019s soundtrack composed by Rafael Langoni Smith consists of 64 chiptune-style tracks. Along with the ASCII-style art, the music helps to give the game both an old-school vibe and its own unique elements. There is a lot of variety in the soundtrack: from the soft and relaxing (Sanctuary Arp II: Title Screen) to dark and ominous (You May Be Experiencing Some Discomfort) to intense and triumphant (Sangue nos Olhos). \n\nThere are some really great and memorable melodies in these tracks. The music often serves as another driving force to make one want to continuing playing longer. There\u2019s a thrill in getting into a fight, hearing a particular track and just knowing that you\u2019re fucked. This is a game soundtrack that I\u2019d actually recommend listening to solely on its own as well!\n\n[h1]TL;DR[/h1]\n\n+Multiple ways to play/build your character\n+Easy to get into, but plenty to master\n+Unique artstyle\n+Comedy-focused writing (which can be good or bad depending on one\u2019s taste, but I\u2019m personally found it entertaining)\n+Decent world-building that gives the setting and world intrigue\n+Melodic chiptune-style music\n\n+/-RNG adds an element of surprise, but also annoyance\n+/-Standard plot that gets the job done, but could have been expanded further (though, I admit that I enjoyed the game regardless of the story)\n\n-Epic/Legendary weapons mean very little since their stats are randomized and often unuseful\n-Crafting as well as some other features (such as the Temple or Library) can feel pointless since the same things can be achieved through grinding", "timestamp_created": 1511841526, "timestamp_updated": 1511841526, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.553581", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37828009": {"recommendationid": "37828009", "author": {"steamid": "76561198124089682", "num_games_owned": 10, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 525, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512155926}, "language": "english", "review": "really great game", "timestamp_created": 1511819694, "timestamp_updated": 1511819694, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.463668", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37760354": {"recommendationid": "37760354", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989579372", "num_games_owned": 407, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1125, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512474627}, "language": "english", "review": "Stunningly fun text based adventure game, with some pretty great ASCII art and surprisingly witty writing and humor.

N\u00e3o parece ter muita coisa pra fazer al\u00e9m de apertar bot\u00f5es repetidamente. As batalhas s\u00e3o por turnos, mas diferente de Final Fantasy ou Breath of Fire, por exemplo, no SanctuaryRPG a tela s\u00f3 atualiza com os novos n\u00fameros de HP, MP, etc. A hist\u00f3ria parece ser mais do mesmo de sempre, sobre um artefato e um sujeito muito poderoso que voc\u00ea tem que matar por algum motivo, e quando voc\u00ea menos percebe j\u00e1 est\u00e1 numa miss\u00e3o secund\u00e1ria, sendo que a principal nem foi t\u00e3o envolvente nem nada. Da\u00ed voc\u00ea morre (no modo cl\u00e1ssico, se voc\u00ea morrer acaba a partida e tem que come\u00e7ar outra do zero) e come\u00e7a de novo, com o mesmo artefato, o mesmo vil\u00e3o, a mesma introdu\u00e7\u00e3o, as mesmas batalhas que parecem meio mon\u00f3tonas. Essas s\u00e3o as primeiras impress\u00f5es dentro do jogo. Na terceira ou quarta vez eu consegui um item muito bom e tinha ficado forte o suficiente pra prosseguir na hist\u00f3ria, mas logo depois morri, e n\u00e3o pelo jogo ser mon\u00f3tono, mas por eu n\u00e3o ter pensado durante a batalha. Comecei outra partida e entendi como funcionam os combos nas batalhas. Percebi que cada inimigo tem uma particularidade, um ponto fraco e um forte, e comecei a explorar cada vez mais as op\u00e7\u00f5es dentro do jogo. Foi a\u00ed que percebi que o jogo tem um sistema legal de com\u00e9rcio [spoiler] (n\u00e3o vou dar spoiler n\u00e3o vou dar spoiler mas o sistema de comprar cerveja quando estiver barata e vender quando a taverna t\u00e1 bem cheia aumenta o brilho do jogo) [/spoiler], um sistema de arena (tem um coliseu com ranks), um sistema de craftar itens, e alguns sistemas interno que s\u00f3 jogando pra ver, mas que acabam dando pluralidade dentro do jogo. A\u00ed, quando voc\u00ea come\u00e7a a explorar essas coisas, fica f\u00e1cil perceber a import\u00e2ncia dos itens certos, e quando voc\u00ea v\u00ea morreu de novo, e come\u00e7a de novo, avan\u00e7ando na hist\u00f3ria e ficando sempre com medo de perder o seu personagem level 35 que levou tanto tempo pra ficar fortinho. \nEu t\u00f4 numa situa\u00e7\u00e3o agora que as batalhas s\u00e3o sempre pensadas, e a op\u00e7\u00e3o de fugir da luta, que eu raramente uso em RPGs, se faz muito \u00fatil quando eu acho que vou morrer. Al\u00e9m das batalhas, digo que a hist\u00f3ria \u00e9 legal, os personagens s\u00e3o bacanas, e os criadores do jogo t\u00eam o m\u00e9rito de serem bem criativos em v\u00e1rios pontos.\n\n-Gr\u00e1ficos:\n8/10. Levando em conta que \u00e9 um gr\u00e1fico composto s\u00f3 por caracteres ASCII, as imagens do jogo (esqueletos, NPCs, cen\u00e1rios, masmorras, itens) s\u00e3o bem feitos. As telas podem ser confusas no come\u00e7o mas depois que voc\u00ea imerge no game voc\u00ea esquece que t\u00e1 jogando um jogo sem gr\u00e1fico, s\u00e9rio mesmo.\n\n-Som:\n8.5/10. Novamente, levando em conta que SanctuaryRPG se inspira em jogos antigos, sua trilha sonora \u00e9 compat\u00edvel com esse estilo, mas \u00e9 bem trabalhada, n\u00e3o tem do que se falar mal.\n\n-Jogabilidade:\n8.5/10. Depois que voc\u00ea imerge no jogo as coisas ficam f\u00e1ceis. Movimentar-se no jogo fica f\u00e1cil, e como tudo \u00e9 por teclas, com o tempo vai ficando tudo mais r\u00e1pido. Embora no come\u00e7o seja f\u00e1cil ficar perdido e achar tudo complexo, os comandos s\u00e3o simples e intuitivos.\n\n-Durabilidade:\n9/10. N\u00e3o terminei o jogo ainda (PORQUE EU N\u00c3O PARO DE MORRER, DROGA), mas at\u00e9 onde joguei me diverti bastante. Dentro do jogo h\u00e1 um aviso de que depois de terminar o jogo no modo cl\u00e1ssico, um novo modo \u00e9 liberado, al\u00e9m de alguns sets de itens novos (seja l\u00e1 o que isso seja). Eu joguei at\u00e9 agora s\u00f3 de Ranger e B\u00e1rbaro, mas s\u00e3o 6 ou 7 classes diferentes entre si n\u00e3o s\u00f3 nas suas caracter\u00edsticas mas no modo de jogo. Tem algumas coisas no jogo que sugerem desafios pra depois do jogo ter sido finalizado (na arena h\u00e1 uma op\u00e7\u00e3o que avisa ser s\u00f3 para jogadores experientes). Acho que mesmo depois que o jogo acaba, nunca vai ser chato revisitar o game por causa do seu estilo que \u00e9 totalmente diferente dos outros da biblioteca.\n\n-Desafio:\n10/10. O dinheiro e os itens n\u00e3o s\u00e3o t\u00e3o f\u00e1ceis dentro do jogo. Itens n\u00e3o s\u00e3o guard\u00e1veis. \u00c0s vezes voc\u00ea escolhe um item errado e s\u00f3 percebe depois de ter se desfeito do anterior, o que te obriga a ficar sempre ligado nas coisas relacionadas aos bens e ao dinheiro. Isso sem falar na morte permanente. \u00c9 frustrante, mas \u00e9 muito legal. Voc\u00ea pode perder uma partida de v\u00e1rias horas numa bobeira. A cautela, depois de um tempo, passa a ser um instrumento fundamental em toda caverna, em todo lugar, em todo evento que voc\u00ea encontra pelo mundo. N\u00e3o s\u00f3 pelo medo de perder tudo, mas tem batalhas que s\u00e3o muito desafiadoras, que voc\u00ea tem que usar a cabe\u00e7a de verdade. Com o tempo a sua gama de op\u00e7\u00f5es de ataques e movimentos na luta aumentam, e voc\u00ea \u00e9 obrigado a usar alguma estrat\u00e9gia (com inimigos \u00e0 altura, claro). No meu caso, eu passei a analisar como s\u00e3o os monstros, quais seus ataques, seus padr\u00f5es, pra evitar riscos. E, sempre, na pior das hip\u00f3teses, correr da luta pode ser a melhor das op\u00e7\u00f5es.\n\n-Custo/Benef\u00edcio:\n10/10. Comprei numa promo\u00e7\u00e3o, e pelo tanto que me diverti jogando isso (aqui marca 7 horas de jogo mas eu joguei talvez o dobro disso offline) j\u00e1 valeu. S\u00e9rio, se estiver numa boa promo\u00e7\u00e3o e voc\u00ea est\u00e1 indeciso, pode comprar.\n\nCONCLUS\u00c3O:\n\u00c9 um jogo bem diferente dos demais. Parece complicado, parece mon\u00f3tono, mas depois de se familiarizar com o jogo \u00e9 f\u00e1cil perder algumas horas nele.

I'm reviewing now since I've finished the game as a Huskian Barbarian.\n\nSo let me just say straight out that the soundtrack to this game is overall one of the best I've heard. Especially one of the themes that plays for boss fights. \n\nNow there's a tutorial for this game if you want to turn it on when you start, but honestly I didn't really understand the mechanics of this game for a long time. Because of that issue, I wound up losing god knows how many characters to that problem. The time it takes to learn the mechanics of the game is a real drawback, and hope something can be done to better address the importance of mechanics like Repositioning. At least starting new characters gets really quick, and hardly takes much time to reach where you left off.\n\nOnce you get a handle on the game's mechanics in battle and out, its pretty fun, and fast paced.\n\nSo is the story pretty good too? Yes, its cool. Cool is the simplest descriptor I can give you. I enjoyed the odd blend of science and fantasy within the game's lore. The humor is just as strange and sometimes the jokes could make me bust out laughing, especially the beginning game's text describing the life your character has led before the start. I only wish the ending was a tad stronger, or there were more opportunities to learn more of the lore and history of the world you're living inside of.\n\nIf you got the patience to stick through many rough beginnings, then you'll be rewarded with a great title that will have you telling yourself, \"Just one more fight!\" or \"That next armor will be the one I need!\"", "timestamp_created": 1501273569, "timestamp_updated": 1501273569, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33620740": {"recommendationid": "33620740", "author": {"steamid": "76561198091096694", "num_games_owned": 25, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1226, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511913225}, "language": "english", "review": "Very fun game, I've been playing it in hour-long chunks, or even longer if I can stretch one run that long.

Finding, buying or crafting these items is great fun, and as a character advances, the loot gets stronger.  Other aspects of the game (music, humor, depth) come together.

Back in 2014 a young and naive boy was creating slighty cringy videos on a youtube channel that had but a few watchers.  Most people saw just another face in the crowd, another young lad attempting to reach fame and fortune through an overly saturated market.  Black Shell Games did not.  They saw an entertainer trying to be the cause of laughter and discussion but was lost in a sea of those exactly like he.  They took pity on this young soul and gifted him a copy of their newest game: SanctuaryRPG.\n\nThree years later, they still remembered him and his weird videos (and disgusting goatee) and sent him a copy of their updated title, now on steam.\n\nAs you can probably tell, SRPG takes me far back into the areas of my life that I try to repress.  I remember the excitement of being approached by a developer about sharing their game with my small audience.  Words cannot describe the joy I found from that simple tweet so long ago.\n\nThe amount of bias I have for the game does not subtract from the absolute comedy and D&D like gameplay that the game provides.  SRPG is a exceptional example of early text-based adventure games and even surpases many of its predecessors in innovation.  Simple dungeon-crawler gameplay allows for more time spent of the development of the ASCII graphics, which look amazing.  Never has 1s and 0s looked so good.\n\nThe only negative thing I can say about the game is the monotony that is the combat.  I believe this to be a fault of the style rather than the execution.  As everything is text-based there is not much room for improvment or innovation when all you can do is select 1, 2, 3, or 4.  Even with special abilities and status effects, there really isn't anything good about the combat and I can only play for a few minutes at a time before boredom overtakes me and I desire something else.\n\nIn short, SanctuaryRPG is a perfect example of the bygone era of the text-based genre.  The story, music, and RPG components more than make up for any failure and fault of the combat system.  Casual and hardcore gamers have much to find and many hours to be lost in this beautiful dungeon crawler.\nPick it up now or on sale, either way is worth your time.\nThanks!\n\nThis is the video I made on the game 3 years ago.\nI want to delete it.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsghmrTMJ2s", "timestamp_created": 1495082104, "timestamp_updated": 1495304248, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.646545", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31811586": {"recommendationid": "31811586", "author": {"steamid": "76561198300173375", "num_games_owned": 93, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 824, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500466683}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0427\u0442\u043e \u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u0441\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0442\u044c..\u043a\u0443\u043f\u0438\u043b \u043f\u043e \u0441\u043a\u0438\u0434\u043a\u0435, \u043d\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0432 \u043d\u0435\u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043f\u043e\u043d\u044f\u043b, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u0431\u044b\u043b\u043e \u044e\u044b \u043a\u0443\u043f\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0438 \u0437\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0443\u044e \u0446\u0435\u043d\u0443.\n\u0420\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u0434 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u043e\u0439 \u0431\u044b\u043b\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0430 \u043a\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f, \u0438\u043d\u0430\u0447\u0435 \u043d\u0435 \u0441\u043a\u0430\u0436\u0435\u0448\u044c.\n\u0413\u0435\u0439\u043c\u043f\u043b\u0435\u0439, \u043f\u043e \u043d\u0430\u0447\u0430\u043b\u0443, \u043e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043d\u0435\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0443\u0448\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0438\u0433\u0440\u043e\u043a\u0430, \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0436\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043d\u0435\u043f\u043e\u043d\u044f\u0442\u043d\u044b\u043c. \u041e\u0434\u043d\u0430\u043a\u043e \u0447\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0437 \u043f\u0430\u0440\u0443 \u0431\u043e\u0435\u0432 \u0438 \u0434\u0438\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0432 \u0431\u044b\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e \u043f\u043e\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0448\u044c \u0447\u0442\u043e \u043a \u0447\u0435\u043c\u0443.\n\u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u044f\u0437\u044b\u043a \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0436\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f, \u043e\u0434\u043d\u0430\u043a\u043e, \u043b\u044e\u0431\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0438 \u0440\u043e\u0433\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u0438 \u0440\u043f\u0433 \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0443\u0442 \u0432 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0439 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0435 \"\u043a\u0430\u043a \u0440\u044b\u0431\u0430 \u0432 \u0432\u043e\u0434\u0435\".\n\n\u0412\u0438\u0437\u0443\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0441\u0442\u0438\u043b\u044c, \u044e\u043c\u043e\u0440, \u0437\u0430\u0442\u044f\u0433\u0438\u0432\u0430\u044e\u0449\u0438\u0439 \u0433\u0435\u0439\u043c\u043f\u043b\u0435\u0439, \u0441\u0430\u0443\u043d\u0434\u0442\u0440\u0435\u043a..\u0447\u0442\u043e \u0442\u0443\u0442 \u0438 \u0433\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0442\u044c - 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1495054355, "timestamp_updated": 1495054355, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.640780", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31793685": {"recommendationid": "31793685", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005215285", "num_games_owned": 559, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 464, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1437170925}, "language": "english", "review": "The work that went into this game is staggering to me.

They should've called this game \u201c1,2,3,3 simulator\u201d.\n\n     Here's the game in a nutshell.  Start game by selecting classic (Permadeath) or Softcore (Non-perma death).  Then you'll pick a character type.  You'll do some tutorial stuff but by 20-30 minutes in you'll have everything available to you.  The game is essentially divided into 2 portions, dungeons (grinding) and town (farming).  In dungeons, you'll fight monsters, bosses, run into events, and occasionally get some random items.  In town, you can go to a bunch of different shops, craft items, run your tavern, and fight in a colosseum.\n\n     I don't really have a lot of positive things to say about this game.  Graphics and music are both fine, that's it.  If you're into games where all you do is farm/grind, then this is the game for you.  If you can't stand non-stop farming/grinding because you like games that are actually fun and challenging, you should strongly consider never playing this game.  There's a good game in here somewhere, but it's almost as if every design decision was chosen based on maximizing how obnoxious it could be.  I could go on for a long time on the bad stuff, but I'll try to hit the main things.\n\n     1.  There's no actual dungeon crawling/exploring in this game (at least there's none in ACT 1).  Rather than go through dungeons or explore, the game gives you a list of areas you can go to along with the recommended level for that area.  You simply press that button \u201c1\u201d, or \u201c2\u201d or \u201c3\u201d and hit enter.  Then  1 of 3 things will pop up:  A. You'll fight an enemy or a boss.  B. An event will occur.  Events just tell you something happening and then you make one of two (sometimes four) choices.  If you choose to pick an option that has you participate in the event, then something good or bad will happen completely at random.  C.  The last thing that happens is you'll find some random item that you don't give a crap about or you'll unlock a mercenary who acts as a passive damage buff in combat.  So 50% of the game devolves down to you pressing 2, fighting an enemy, pressing 2, fighting an enemy, pressing 2, finding an item, pressing 2, fighting an enemy, pressing 2, EVENT!  You find a box: \u201cA\u201d to open box or \u201cB\u201d to leave..... press A, \u201cThe box explodes, you're left with one hp\u201d.  Heal up, press 2, fighting an enemy, press 2, fighting an enemy, game now unlocks boss area.  Press 3 to fight boss, beat boss, new area opens up.  Press 3 to go to new area, fight enemy, press 3, find an item, press 3 fight an enemy......... This is the game.  If you found that obnoxious to read, just wait until you play it.  It never stops until your character dies, you beat the game, you kill yourself, or you decide you'd rather go play something interesting.\n\n     2.  The other 50% of the game will be spent in the town farming items/gold.  You'll get a crap ton of craftable material.  You'll go to the blacksmith and give him your material and he'll make you a weapon completely at random.  If it's better, press \u201cE\u201d to equip, if it's not, press \u201cS\u201d to salvage it for parts.  There's no inventory system, you either equip it or get rid of it.  You can go to your own base and dig to randomly find items or dig for iron which will allow you to craft a random piece of equipment once you have 100 iron.  You can also craft armor, charms, and other things in your base.  You'll play a terrible minigame every single time you want to craft an item at your base.  How good the item will be is mostly random, especially since the game always picks the 2 character stats it will increase at random.  You can also run a tavern, which will allow you buy beer to sell to customers and randomly get gifts (equipment or craftable materials usually).  Even selling beer to customers isn't fun.  There's a set number of customers, a set price for buying beer, and a set price for selling beer.  If the price for selling is higher, buy beer and sell it until you run out of customers.  I've never seen the price of buying beer higher than the selling price, so the entire tavern is just another farming items/gold system.  The town can take a while to go through when you have a bunch of craftable material.  Then when 95% of the stuff you craft turns out to be crap, you get more craftable material from salvaging it, so you then craft more crap............  It gets old really quickly.\n\n     3.  The last thing I'll touch on is the actual fighting.  It seems like it should be quick and easy, but it isn't.  It's needlessly complex and if you actually take your time while fighting, the game would take a long, long, long time to beat.  There are way too many status/damage inflicting things going on during battles, and they occur all over the screen.  You have to pay attention to enemy distance, enemy prefix abilities, status effects on enemies, status effects on you, then you have to look out for the ensnare status effect which shows up at a different spot from the other status effects.  Bosses have bars that fill up for special attacks, you have bars that fill up for things.  Sometimes quick time events pop up after you/enemy take actions, so you need to be on the lookout for these too.  Then there're your choices for actions, these change as you take certain actions, so you'll have to look at what these do each and every time.  Probably the dumbest thing though is that the game gives you the option to press \u201c?\u201d to see a list of what all the different status effects do, but doing this actually takes up your turn during combat and allows the enemy to attack you.  What idiot decided it was a good idea to penalize the player for looking at what a status effect does?  Most of this is irrelevant though.  You see, during fights against normal enemies, all you need to do is press this combination over and over again until you win, \u201c1,2,3,3\u201d.  So that's all you'll do over and over and over and over and over every single fight.  You do have to watch your hp on occasion.  If you see it go down below 40%, press 4 to heal, then go back to pressing 1,2,3,3 over and over again.  This makes a large portion of the game brainless and pointless, as you'll autopilot through battle after battle after battle.  The only time you really need to pay attention to what's happening is during boss fights.

Also if you are spam pressing away at 123412341234 ult then you would see that there are times that you gain special leverage over enemies. Usually a grapple or the description would read a very blunt tell of what they way do next.

(I personally enjoyed it but can completely understand why others would not)\n\nOverall, I felt like the pros were good enough to outshine the cons. This is especially true if you're new to the game.

I love older RPG's such as Nethack, Wizardry and the like and I was expecting something akin to that. What I got was a bit different, and I'm glad I took the plunge. It is more akin in some ways to games like Oregon Trail. Acting as a sort of roguelike adventure, you create a character and are given their generated backstory. Then you hop into the world proper exploring areas, fighting monsters, and trying to improve your character enough to take on the next major challenge. There are fun mini games as part of the game mechanics such as the crafting system where you need to balance the quality, durability, and \"heat\" of an item as you craft them. The combat itself acts in a similar resource management fashion, having the player link skills together into combos while constantly repositioning themselves in the battle to distance themselves from heavy handed enemy \"charge\" attacks and make sure they are properly managing their HP and MP for when enemies do big damage.\n\nAnother thing I really like is the sense of humor. I have not put a lot of time into the game yet but already there have been lots of fun little jokes that don't take away from the overall experience and really give the game personality.

It's like they put the best parts of several genres into a blender and this game is the delicious smoothie that came out. There's Rogue-like, Text-Based adventures, and Turn-based RPGs elements, and an outstanding humour as well. Also, it's all in ASCII. Yes, you read me right, and that was one of the best design decisions made by the developers, I'll get into that soon.\n\nSeveral years ago, someone known as The Matron searched and found a legendary sword capable of destroying armies by itself, and with that sword, she set out to destroy the world as we know it.\nBut then, a hero appeared, a powerful man, a born leader, the guiding light to command us all. Cyrus, The Magnificent (Y'know, Tim, The Enchanter's little brother). After the great war that occurred after our Hero's arrival, and our victory, The Matron was sealed in an ice crystal, but after some time of peace, she broke out, escaping back into our world, and Cyrus, Disappeared\u2026\nNow you, brave hero, must stop The Matron once and for all, and rid this world of darkness.\nThe game's story is really clever and funny, creating a randomly generated one for each character you make, and trust me, you will have to make several before completing this game, giving you plenty of backstory to read, all of them incredibly hilarious.\n\nThe game is like a text adventure game, the screen displays several actions, and you choose one of them, but it requires a lot of strategy, as the combat is turn-based and really difficult to master. the game also has several rogue-like elements to it, perma-death and unlocks for future runs, and everyone knows that's how you get to my good side, I adore rogue-likes. But don't be fooled, this game has very little RNG to it, it is all strategy, without that you won't win the game! There's also a lot of character development and creation, you can choose a class, a race, and a weapon specialization, it's a bit complicated at first, but when you get the hang of it, you see how well done it is.\n\nThe graphics are honestly amazing for ASCII, it shows how much time the developers spent on making the enemies and the scenery, and the music and sound effects are just wonderful, it truly feels like those old games, and there's also a cover of the soundtrack in the piano, and it is lovely.\nEverything is just so old-school, I love it.\nAnd that brings me to the main selling point of this game, It looks and plays like the old MS-DOS games, but with a modern design, story and humour to it, and it feels great, this game is nothing short of genius, you've really got to commend the developers for making such a great piece of gaming art.\n\nOverall, if you've lived in the era of the birth of gaming, you've got to play this game for the nostalgic value, and if you haven't, you also need to play this game to get an idea of how games used to be, it's just a wonderful piece of game history and art.\n\nRead more Video Game reviews at cassus.org", "timestamp_created": 1485567961, "timestamp_updated": 1485568618, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497262", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29408526": {"recommendationid": "29408526", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972649989", "num_games_owned": 234, "num_reviews": 60, "playtime_forever": 270, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481359495}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041d\u0430 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u0432\u0437\u0433\u043b\u044f\u0434 - \u043e\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043d\u0435\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043f\u043b\u0438\u0432\u0430\u044f \u0420\u041f\u0413. \u041d\u043e, \u043a \u0441\u043e\u0436\u0430\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044e, \u0441\u043e \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0435\u043c \u0432\u044b\u044f\u0441\u043d\u044f\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0441\u043a\u0443\u0447\u043d\u0430 \u0438 \u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043d\u0430, \u043f\u0440\u0438 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u043c \u0442\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0441\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043b\u044f\u044e\u0449\u0430\u044f \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u043e\u043a\u0430 \u0441\u0432\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u043a \u043d\u0443\u043b\u044e.", "timestamp_created": 1485036642, "timestamp_updated": 1485036642, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.533920", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29369156": {"recommendationid": "29369156", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080451663", "num_games_owned": 1270, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 11653, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490796064}, "language": "english", "review": "basic text based game, with a lot to see and do, is well written and can be played for many hours\n\nachievements do not work which was sad, hopefully that changes", "timestamp_created": 1484888281, "timestamp_updated": 1484888281, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.613654", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29334616": {"recommendationid": "29334616", "author": {"steamid": "76561198305845254", "num_games_owned": 462, "num_reviews": 359, "playtime_forever": 280, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484716385}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Basicamente o melhor jogo de AMIGA dos anos 80 que nunca foi lan\u00e7ado.

As you do not see any moving sprites, it is naturally very much focussed on text and numbers, which means reading all the time (of course without voice acting). The omnipresence of stat numbers makes the combat and world exploration quite abstract and static. As this kind of technology cannot possibly win you over on a visual level, the writing could have been the means to create some kind of atmosphere. Unfortunately, the creators missed this opportunity, making an attempt on a weird surrealistic humour that did not make me laugh once (Pony Island was much cleverer in my opinion). Even worse, it destroys the immersion again and again, and you should not do that in an RPG unless you are really talented in writing self-ironic and fourth-wall-breaking scripts.\n\nIt is interesting to try out new and old concepts as alternatives to the modern mainstream, but there is a reason why ASCII-interfaces are not used anymore.

Control and Gameplay : it's easy to get used to the gameplay (mostly use only ONE letter/number to do action), it's does not require high requirement pc (because the design is so simple), so far no lags/ bugs. Some skills / status are hard to remember (there are A LOT of them), but there is a tutorial book so rest assured.\n\n2. Fun Factor : I like the catchy tunes and the game simple design, reminds me of older type of rpgs on older consoles. Because of the simple control of the game, I could do something else by playing (for example: eating my ramen). Also, there is a difficulty slider (if you want the game easier/ harder). There are a lot of choices we need to make and it AFFECTS the actual gameplay. I like it because I could make my own story as well.\n\n3. Graphic : very cute even though it's only using simple ASCII art. Very refreshing concept and contrast to the mega popular 3D objects. No special interface for this game, though. I don't know why can't it open the steam overlays to capture images (?) Too bad there were a lot of moments to be remember.\n\n4. Replayability Value : VERY HIGH because there are several save slots for different characters (with each different jobs), different playstyle (even though some moves are similar, just some minor changes in names/ description), different quest and difficulties (still the main quest is same for all playtrough), and also the main reason is : [spoiler]Beware of death on Classic mode-- it's permanent death for your current character, surprise you need to play a new game with new character).[/spoiler]\n\n5. Sound : catchy tunes also I get some free piano style music dlc. Unless you want some real \"music\", this one will not amuse you that much.\n\n6. Story : can't say it's good yet. So far, all of the character have same main story and it's kinda linear and \"gimmicky\". If you want real story (and you are not into the \"make your own story\" thing), this game offers not much of a complexity of a heroic story. The conversation also doesn't hold any meaning to the story.\n\n7. Value for Full Price : to support the great indie developers out there, why not? But yaay I get it when Steam Winter Sale being hold, so got it for only 10% of full price. It's kinda pricey for full price, but still okay since I realized making this kind of game need some deep thoughts from the devs. \n\nThank you for reading!", "timestamp_created": 1483935954, "timestamp_updated": 1483935954, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517345", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29130686": {"recommendationid": "29130686", "author": {"steamid": "76561198170100746", "num_games_owned": 155, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 601, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492199033}, "language": "english", "review": "Easy to learn and only some things are kinda hard to learn until about two battles in when you realize what was wrong was that your genitals were exposed and the enemy was swinging a sword at them.\n\n10/10 would get my genitals punched again", "timestamp_created": 1483921778, "timestamp_updated": 1483921778, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29123911": {"recommendationid": "29123911", "author": {"steamid": "76561198094082999", "num_games_owned": 115, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 1361, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483903783}, "language": "english", "review": "Look on the bright side first, the soundtrack is great. The control scheme is neat. I like the graphic and some of the humors. I like the fact that bought this game for only 80 cent and got a full day out of it.\n\nOkay, now to the rant. The game design is broken beyond helping.\n\nI had a legendary dagger called \"Riot\" on a human wizard maxing out Dex, became a Grandmaster at level 80, and I still couldn't kill the final boss. So, I sold the legendary dagger and bought a common axe that has Umbral enchantment and slew boss with 0 point in Strength or Heavy Mastery.\n\nHow do I feel about this anticlimatic ending? I feel trolled.\n\n1) Forget about tank builds\n- This game has HP, but late-game bosses (everything from the matron onwards) kill you via % max HP bleed, doom and mana threasing.\n- This game has evasion and block, but late-game bosses kill you via unavoidable, everlasting and incurable % max HP bleed, doom, and mana threasing.\n- This game has heals, but ALL of them deteriorate when you use ANY of them in a boss fight. I basically had to drop half of the combo set that has heals in it in order to preserve heal power for the last one third boss gauge.\n- Meanwhile, enemies grow stronger in time (you can too but your damage scaling is just way worse)\n\n2) Forget about dps builds\n- This game has combo, but your combo count resets upon heal and hitting a thorning boss costs 25% max HP to bleed stack PER HIT so it's impossible to combo.

Get quest (always the same), check if there\u2019s some new weapons for sale. Next, go to market and buy stuff for blacksmith and take quest. Go to library \u2013 read books. Get exp. Create more books with hides. Go to your camp, dig some holes. Upgrade your camp. Craft randomly generated swords, shields, armor and charms. Go to tavern, sell beer, get quest to kill some mobs. Finally go kill some mobs with the same pattern: press 1, press 2, press 3, press 3. Repeat. Sometimes you need to avoid incoming attack with repositioning, heal yourself with 4 or use special attack with R. That\u2019s it. Repeat all the steps all the way through to the end of the game.

I'm not sure how to describe the game to you, the potential buyer. Its a turn based RPG that is also a rougelike. It doesnt have any visuals (during combat) but that doesnt take away from the game itself. In combat you can start a chain of skills, creating a combo that empowers your attacks and lets you use finishers. This is really cool in my opinion, because not only can you preform combos, but you have to manage that with dodging powerful enemy attacks, which could break your combo. Once you get a really high combo, you can use your ultimate, which gets stronger based on how high your combo is. This is just the basics, the game becomes a much more as you grow your character. But you can lose the character too due to the rougelike elements. And not to mention the soundtrack is pretty great. I bought the game for $.80.

Progression is often heavily gated by the quality of the loot that you're able to find and craft, but that was a plus for me, because I love RNGesus with all my heart. \n\nThough you shouldn't need to do too much of it, grinding is actually pretty pleasant, because you won't have to wait for animations to play. Things will move as quickly as your fingers will allow them to. However, going on auto-pilot all the time is almost guaranteed to kill you: SanctuaryRPG challenges players by forcing them to adapt their strategies (which are generally pretty simple) to an extensive list of modifiers that determine how each enemy should be approached (e.g. some reflect damage, some are immune to your ultimate, some drain your mana, etc...). This is especially true for fights against bosses, which can have multiple modifiers at once.\n\nCombat is really smooth. As always, your goal is losing the race to the end of your health bar, but there are other factors besides HP and MP to consider during fights. Every turn, you'll have to keep track of your distance from the enemy, debuff stacks, ult status, combo count, buff durations, buff costs (they tick over many turns), guarding, action commands (e.g. grapples, hit confirms, charges), and other things. The game's interface is deceptively simple, because even though each element is easy to understand on its own, juggling all of them at once in short turns is a fun challenge.\n\nGearing up and allocating stat points is really intuitive, but you can still make some pretty creative builds. My best character so far was a level 58 Goern Assassin with bows that focused on DEX and VIT.\n\nI really enjoyed the music. If you're interested, I'm pretty sure you can find the full in-game OST and the piano version of 12 of the in-game tracks on youtube. \n\nI thought the ASCII was cool, but that's obviously just a personal thing. Some of the landscapes are pretty lackluster, but the enemies, weapons, and other larger-scale objects look gorgeous.\n\nI'm going to keep playing, because it does a great job scratching my itch for a simple yet highly engaging RPG. I'd happily pay up to 15 bucks for it if I had to buy it again.

Get it on a sale for that, and I think you'll be happy. \n\nI have a lot of mixed feelings on this one, it was really hard to thumbs up it but harder to NOT thumbs up it, and I just wanna write it down dang it leave me alone, this game really doesn't deserve 50 paragraphs written about it but screw it I guess I'm doing it anyway. \n\nI'm gonna start with the pros first so we can get it out of the way. Biggest best pro we got here is THE MUSIC. It's really nice. I really dig it. I don't think everyone will love it, but one thing I really respect about it is that there's like 15+ songs for fighting regular enemies. Most rpgs, turn taking ones especially, will make you go into a battle and play the same song over and over and over and over for every normal battle until you hate yourself. This one just puts a buncha songs in for every enemy. SURE sometimes it'll be a stupid weak skeleton and the music will sound like a final boss, but I appreciate it anyway. \n\nSECOND! I like the graphics/ascii style. It's a cute style, has its charm. People who see screenshots can easily decide if they like it or not, you'll pretty much get what you expect. My only issue with it is that the background often times does not mimic the area that's being described. Like you'll supposedly be in hell and you'll see a background of mountains. There's not exactly a large supply of graphics and ascii stuff. \n\nThird, the battle system is all right. It's a turn taking rpg, I mean how much can you do with it, unless its a strategy turn taking rpg? It does what it does all right, it tried to even spice it up to make it feel more actioney when it isn't at all. It almost feels fast paced at times. There's some cons with it which I'll bring up later, but I'll just say it's not the worst thing. \n\nANYWAY, lets get to the cons. This game has two major cons that just really hold it back. I wanted more from this game, and it's a bit frustrating. It can make it seem like a thumbs down to me and some people because it's the worst kind of thing, where you like what you're playing but you just want MORE of it. \n\nFirst and biggest con. This game is a rogue-like for some reason. It's advertised as one, for sure, it didn't come as a shock. I expected it to be different, I suppose, done better. For everything I played with this game, I just don't think it was necessary for it to be a rogue-like at all. I think making it a rogue-like held it back on many many many levels. \n\nSo you got yourself a rogue-like and you see there's different classes! Cool, I thought they'd actually play differently, and that's where the rogue-like part comes in. Nah, they all play pretty much completely the same, but with different stats. I wouldn't mind this at all if, you know, you didn't lose everything when you die. \n\nThen there's the story. Maybe the story changes every time you play? Nope, it's the same exact thing, some exact quests, same exact grind. I'd be okay with the grind, I really would, but what fun is there grinding for literally 6+ hours, and then dying to a random enemy because you let it get 2 swings on you and you scrolled by the text too fast? That's what ended my last game, and I did not feel the desire to keep going. \n\nGoing on with the grindy aspect, there's A LOT of items in the game, and a lot of randomly generated crafting items. You'll have to spend QUITE sometime making stuff if you want to get the best equipment, leveling your skills, and just in general crafting and sorting through the junk. Then, once again, if you die, its all gone. What's the reason for it?\n\nThere's just no change. You'll get some different enemies in between, but they're just healthbars, there's no \"story\" change in anyway whatsoever. There IS an option to play without perma-death, but it's marked as \"not-recommended\" and you'll lose out on \"extra bonuses\" whatever those are. I think it's safe to assume most people are gonna do the normal perma-death version because you don't know what's in store for you or how different it will be. \n\nALL in all, I think it was just a really bad decision to make this a rogue-like. There's just too much grinding and virtually no reason to ever start a new game. It's not like Binding of Isaac where one run will take at most an hour, and you might get random items that completely change how you play the game every time. \n\nImagine it's like Pokemon, but once you get a white out in Pokemon, you gotta start ALL over. Sure, it's not hard to do that at all, but why would you want to? Some people make specific challenges for that, and that's fair, but the regular game does not punish you with that because it knows that would be foolish and unfun. \n\nOkay, well I got that outta the way. The second big con is partially because of the first con still. \n\nThe story. It's very shallow AT TIMES and the first two acts have the tone just ALL over the place. For a text based game, a story is very important, but I feel the writer/game dev/whoever was held back by the fact that it's a rogue-like. The descriptions and story events are written very quickly and there's not a huge burst of information, which can be done really well at times. \n\nBut for this game, it feels it leaves more questions than answers, and a lot of the questions aren't very fun questions. There is a lack of a world in this game, it's not explained incredibly well, and doesn't go into great description of what it is even as you go on. The tone can go from being incredibly serious to dopey memes in the same sentence. There was one part where this guy is trying to rebuilt a robot in the likeness of his dead daughter right? Seems a pretty dark and sad thing, and then one of his failed creations is like \"404 daughter love not found, hug.exe not responding\" and it just really really takes you out of it. \n\nA lot of the humor can feel like \"le random\" at times too. There are potatoes in the world, and for whatever reason, everyone hates potatoes. A lot. It's never explained. If it was explained, maybe I could give it a pass, but it's usually just \"UGH POTATOES, I HATE THEM\" like and it just makes you think of \"le penguin of doom XD\" and you die a little on the inside. \n\nAt the same time, the story can be pretty nice. I really liked the descriptions of hell and the hell beings. At that point they mostly did away with dumb meme jokes, and I appreciated it. Wish though that they delved deeper into that, tried to make sense of what it was doing, instead of being really sarcastic and uncaring about your story. I get the feeling like the author was afraid to try on this a lot. I see the potential, but they were worried it would look cliche and dumb. Personally, I feel it's better to try than just not try at all, but I suppose that was their way of trying, so I don't know. \n\nSO I wrote like 60 grillion words on a dumb 80 cent game. There were some bad times, it's very flawed, but overall I really liked the experience and I'm genuinely glad I played it, if not for the fact that it made me want to play more text/ascii adventures. Anyone who read all this disjointed garbage of a review, sorry, because it certainly sounds like I'm making it seem like its a terrible game while recommending it. \n\nTL;DR: 80 cents is fine, anything more than a buck, I don't think so.", "timestamp_created": 1481093132, "timestamp_updated": 1481093147, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.703276", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28209610": {"recommendationid": "28209610", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008486506", "num_games_owned": 132, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 355, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492283806}, "language": "russian", "review": "great game, my friend enjoyed it", "timestamp_created": 1480971829, "timestamp_updated": 1480971829, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.484352", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28207362": {"recommendationid": "28207362", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046750160", "num_games_owned": 138, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 582, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508517644}, "language": "english", "review": "At the moment, I'd say I'm kind of neutral.

In concept, it's a turn-based, menu-driven distillation of all the \"number go up\" bits that make games in the mold of Diablo so addictive. In some places, the game delivers on that concept in a way just short of genius; in others, it goes \"eh, whatever, this will do\" and calls it a day.\n\n[b]Brilliant[/b]: The battle system is complex and engaging despite its extreme abstraction. Attack and defense abilities, status effects, monster affixes, range (sort of), weapon properties, character class features, and more besides--the better you learn these things, the more successful you'll be. Various elements require that you stay mindful of what's going on rather than run on autopilot, lest you miss opportunities or suffer dangerous consequences.\n\n[b]Lazy[/b]: The UI is atrocious. You have to mash Enter after every menu choice, as if you were working with a terminal prompt instead of pushing virtual buttons. The mouse does nothing, but the game doesn't bother to hide the cursor in fullscreen mode.\n\n[b]Brilliant[/b]: There are tons of ways to get experience, gold, and items. If you're feeling behind the curve against the current crop of storyline foes, you don't necessarily have to farm lower-level monsters--you can take on some level-matched foes in the arena, read books in the Library, tend patrons in your tavern, or craft, all of which will move you along at least a bit.\n\n[b]Lazy[/b]: Some of these activities, though, are deadly boring, and you'll roll your eyes when some new system presents itself and it turns out to be yet another thing that awards experience, gold, and random items. Crafting? Experience and random items (you get only minimal input into what you craft). Tavern? Gold, experience, and \"gifts\" from patrons that are, yes, random items. Fetch quests? Experience and random items. There's all of one well-hidden quest that gives you anything unique or interesting.\n\n[b]Brilliant[/b]: The aesthetic. Well, maybe not [i]brilliant[/i] exactly, but at least gutsy and unusual. The ASCII art is well done and the music catchy.\n\n[b]Lazy[/b]: The art you see has nothing to do with what you're doing, most of the time. You can be trudging through a hellish underworld, and still see pictures of green forests and blue oceans. The writing is terrible; there's a nonsensical main plot about robots and fallen angels that tries to get you to take it seriously even as the rest of the game cracks jokes about potatoes. (If you can even call them jokes. The author seems to think that simply saying the word \"potato\" is the height of hilarity.) Don't bother talking to NPCs--their dialogue is bland and doesn't change from start to finish.\n\n[b]Brilliant[/b]: Itemization is very well designed. You can't stash old equipment, and each item has at most a core attack/defense stat, two attribute boosts, and an affix. That means that you're almost always trading something off when you upgrade, prompting reconsideration of what's in your other slots. Just changing out a weapon of one category for another can drastically change your play style.\n\n[b]Lazy[/b]: Permadeath. I don't take offense to the idea in principle--Nethack, that age-old Roguelike, is one of my favorite games of all time. But it doesn't fit at all here. There's not enough variety from one game to the next, games take too long to proceed to the latter stages, and there isn't enough of a skill learning curve to justify it. I recommend playing a couple short games to get the idea, then once you settle on a build you like, backing up your save files as you go.\n\nIn the end, I do give this game the thumbs-up because it's such an unusual specimen, and I found it enjoyable enough to play to conclusion on the standard difficulty.

Any simple mistake with laughably cost you. You can start out from whatever classes you want, and the game douses you in a list of perks to the point where you feel nearly invincible,  not to mention the mouth-watering bonuses your weapons, armors, and miscs offer. At the same time, however, you ABSOLUTELY cannot overestimate yourself when you pick up this game, or it will cost you getting carried away. Even blindly grinding mid-level mobs can sometimes sucker punch you and knock you dead.\n\nEvery ounce of music in the game is enjoyable, from the basicness of the low-level skeleton fights to the errogenous coin ticks of the tavern. I'd buy a soundtrack if I could.\n\nThough the graphics cleverly implicate many integers for use of shading and texture, it gets kind of hard to tell what things are until you take a second to look at them, so that gets kind of cumbersome.\n\nIt's also a very flexible game: you can either sit down, grab some chips and soda, and score through the game as far as you want, or play bit by bit every so often. As demanding as it is, you can choose your own pace and enjoy it however quickly you'd like.\n\nNo matter what class you have, it's important to spend some time learning every move you have in your arsenal (you have two sets of consecutive attacks that alternate for every finisher you do), which adds on to the whole patience business.\n\nIf you like being rewarded with secrets, then find another game. You more or less risk your booty when you find secrets in the overworld, which gets highly irritating, especially when you find yourself up against a high-level mob from one. However, some other times the game can offer some neat jazz like overpowered weaponry, though it's all in a coin flip in the end.\n\nOne of the larger bits of the game I don't like is the raunchy difficulty of the game. I actually could not stand to finish it even to date, simply because of how unrewarding and punishing the game feels. Though if you're the kind of sick twisted bastard who gets a kick out of that, then it's your grave you're digging.\n\nOtherwise, it's a nice game if you're looking for pure-hearted challenge and shoving druid bear claws up skellys' arses.

Its the rare gem that is really way more than you were expecting and can tie you up for hours and hours with just raw mechanics and gameplay (since being a turn based ascii rpg, gameplay is basically the main focus).", "timestamp_created": 1463103578, "timestamp_updated": 1463103578, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.563447", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22929341": {"recommendationid": "22929341", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997950575", "num_games_owned": 848, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 1759, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493410607}, "language": "english", "review": "Still missing achievements, but this is a game worth playing for hours", "timestamp_created": 1463072371, "timestamp_updated": 1510604873, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491146", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22926147": {"recommendationid": "22926147", "author": {"steamid": "76561198104963431", "num_games_owned": 685, "num_reviews": 136, "playtime_forever": 1209, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1465101148}, "language": "schinese", "review": "[h1]\u5c31\u50cf\u4e00\u9897\u79cd\u5b50\uff0c\u5b83\u5f00\u51fa\u4e86\u65e0\u6570\u7684\u82b1[/h1]\n---------------------\n[h1]>99%\u7684\u4eba\u4e0d\u4f1a\u559c\u6b22\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u800c\u6211\u662f\u90a31%[/h1]\n\u60f3\u8981\u8bf4\u660e\u8fd9\u4e00\u70b9\u5f88\u7b80\u5355\uff0c\u5728\u6e38\u620f\u753b\u8d28\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u597d\u3001\u4e43\u81f3\u6709\u4e86VR\u4f53\u9a8c\u7684\u4eca\u5929\uff0c\u5f88\u96be\u4f1a\u6709\u4eba\u5173\u6ce8\u3001\u559c\u6b22\u4e0a\u8fd9\u4e48\u4e00\u6b3e\u5168ASCII\u5b57\u7b26\u754c\u9762\u7684\u6e38\u620f....\n\u54e6\uff0c\u5148\u522b\u6025\u7740\u614c...\u66f4\u7cdf\u7cd5\u7684\u6211\u8fd8\u6ca1\u8bf4\u5b8c\u5462\uff1a\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u4e0d\u652f\u6301\u9f20\u6807\u64cd\u7eb5\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e00\u6b65\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u90fd\u9700\u8981\u4f60\u5728\u952e\u76d8\u4e0a\u952e\u5165\u76f8\u5173\u6309\u952e\uff0c\u5f88\u7e41\u7410\u3002\n......\nAnyway\uff0c\u6211\u77e5\u9053\uff0c\u770b\u5230\u8fd9\u7684\u4f60\u5df2\u7ecf\u6253\u7b97\u8981\u8d70\u4e86\u3002\n\u4e0d\u8fc7\u522b\u6025\uff0c\u4e5f\u8bb8\u4f60\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\u4e00\u70b9\u4e5f\u4e0d\u6765\u7535\uff0c\u4f46\u6216\u8bb8\uff0c\u4f60\u4f1a\u5bf9\u6211\u63a5\u4e0b\u6765\u8bb2\u7684\u6545\u4e8b\u611f\u5174\u8da3\u3002\n\n[h1]>\u8d77\u6e90[/h1]\n\u4f60\u4e5f\u8bb8\u542c\u8bf4\u8fc7Roguelike\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8bcd\uff0c\u4f46\u4f60\u5f88\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u6240\u8c13\u7684Rogue-like(\u7c7bRogue)\u91cc\u7684like\u6307\u7684\u662flike\u4ec0\u4e48\u3002\n\u4e0a\u4e16\u7eaa80\u5e74\u4ee3\uff0c\u6709\u4e24\u4f4d\u201c\u4e0d\u52a1\u6b63\u4e1a\u201d\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08Michael Toy\u4e0e Glenn Wichman\uff0c\u8bd5\u56fe\u5236\u4f5c\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u7740\u65e0\u9650\u91cd\u590d\u4f53\u9a8c\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u3002\n\u4e8e\u662f\u4ed6\u4eec\u82b1\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u793c\u62dc\uff08\u636e\u8bf4\uff09\uff0c\u505a\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5bf9\u540e\u4e16\u5f71\u54cd\u9887\u6df1\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u3002\u662f\u7684\uff0c\u5c31\u662f\u300aRogue\u300b\u3002\u8fd9\u6b3e\u6e38\u620f\u8fd0\u884c\u4e8eUNIX\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u662f\u5f53\u65f6\u6700\u65e9\u7684\u56fe\u5f62\u754c\u9762\u6e38\u620f\u3002\n\n\u5728\u300aRogue\u300b\u4e4b\u540e\uff0c\u5176\u5b9e\uff0c\u8fd8\u6709\u4e00\u6b3e\u540d\u4e3a\u300aNetHack\u300b\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u3002\u8fd9\u6b3e\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u4f1f\u5927\u4e4b\u5904\uff0c\u5728\u4e8e\u5b83\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u201c\u6218\u6597\u3001\u63a2\u7d22\u7136\u540e\u5f3a\u5316\u81ea\u5df1\u201d\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6982\u5ff5\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u501f\u9274\uff0c\u5982\u4ee5\u6492\u4e2d\u7684\u5404\u79cd\u5956\u52b1\u623f\u548c\u9053\u5177\u3002\n\n\u800c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u521b\u59cb\u8005\uff0c\u300aRogue\u300b\u4e3b\u8981\u4e3a\u4e4b\u540e\u65e0\u6570\u7684Roguelike\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4ee5\u4e0b\u51e0\u79cd\u4e3b\u8981\u7684\u7279\u70b9\uff1a\n1. \u968f\u673a\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8ff7\u5bab/\u5730\u56fe\n2. \u590d\u6742\u7684\u4f46\u6709\u8da3\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u7cfb\u7edf\n3.

When i got the game i was not expecting much except some nostalgic ascii goodness i grew up with during the dial-up BBS hey days of the 90's. Turns out the game consists of a deep  game engine/combat-engine coated with really retro text-ui. Basically it seems to me that the devs - who have obviously played the classics just decided to make a game that pays homage to old classics and also make to it 'the best there is' using modern technology but still make it look like it's a old game. And by that i mean menus and everything are retro but all works smoothly - unless it's supposed to move sluggishly. Also the rich sound world in the background betrays the fact this game is no retro technically. \n\nSo should you buy it? Depends. Rogue-like players will like it but as some players have pointed out the joke-like nature of encounters and certain linearity will wear you down in the longer run. Game will require some stamina from the player. things are revealed in time and the pacing is slow. \n\nHowever if are you just curious what the game is like then get it right away. It's price is not bad and easily worth it. It simply a unique game in my library - there is no other game i can directly compare this to and i do have a pretty decent set of roguelikes. \n\nMany weird wtf moments with this game. For me just the surprise elements i have encountered during the first 10 hours and the constant finding of new things has kept the game very fresh. And i have only tried two classes as of yet.

The learning scheme is kinda like that : Play -> Die + learn -> Play again -> learn -> Die anyway -> Ragequit -> Play with more knowledge and more determination (like, 1h later, I'm not that much of a tryhard-guy though and I played it again and again, because that game wants to be appreciated, it has so many things you'd love..)\nBe patient, that's how I made it though.. don't try anything in a zone you're not 10+ levels above the highest recommended level.. and don't try to fight bosses, you'll have your fair share of stressful bosses by following the storyline only, and I came to the conclusion that those bosses you encounter are a real pain in the neck..\n\n\n(Please be kind about grammar/conjugation mistakes so forth, English isn't my native language and I apologize at whomever eye-bled reading me :D)", "timestamp_created": 1456496401, "timestamp_updated": 1456496401, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497512", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21468483": {"recommendationid": "21468483", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055205810", "num_games_owned": 295, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 450, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483422733}, "language": "english", "review": "I really enjoy this game a lot, but I would appreciate it more if the developer was more active with it.

It also has a catchy and enjoyable soundtrack.\n\nThe central gameplay loop [i]does[/i] seem monotonous, albeit instantly familiar:\n\n1. Kill things.\n2. Level up; find randomised loot.\n3. Repeat, watching your numbers increase, until you can take on the boss of the current Act.\n4. Kill the boss.\n5. Proceed to the next Act and repeat.\n\n(This is occasionally interrupted by inconveniently dying, cursing at the screen, and rolling a new character\u2014or, on Softcore difficulty, respawning with 0 gold and 0 EXP. Also, there are a few side activities that produce EXP and loot with varying amounts of player effort, but they are of course only temporary distractions from the main loop.)\n\nBut hey, if the game were only as boring as I just made it sound, I wouldn't be recommending it. So, here's why I'm addicted to this silly and engrossing game:\n\n1. The combat system instantly grabbed me. Chaining attacks creates combos, which raise the multiplier for your ult. You can (and should) reposition yourself to put distance between you and the enemy, to break their guard, to dodge an attack with a lead-up, or to thwart their missile lock-on. Oh, wait\u2014they ensnared you? Cut yourself free. They wounded you? You'll have to heal or you won't be able to reposition as effectively. They poisoned you? Too many poison stacks and you'll go blind. And there's so much more to it than I can describe here. It's thrilling; looking at the combat screen and entering commands, I can't help but feel like a wizard.\n\n2. The music is surprisingly good and goes beyond what one would expect from a game with these visuals. The battle themes in particular are stuck in my head.\n\n3. The writing and enemy design ranges from silly meta humour to lightly engaging adventure-drama. I want to see what stupid random event will pop up, just as much as I want to see what happens next in the (semi-)serious story.\n\nTo give a more personal testimonial: I got someone hooked on this game, despite his dislike for typing and reading walls of text. The combat gameplay and the music won him over. That's a real triumph in my book.\n\nGo ahead and give the demo a whirl!", "timestamp_created": 1456393541, "timestamp_updated": 1456552370, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505173", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21440587": {"recommendationid": "21440587", "author": {"steamid": "76561198259558412", "num_games_owned": 624, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 508, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1457510939}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u975e\u5e38\u559c\u6b22\u8fd9\u79cd\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u5f88\u591a\u5185\u5bb9\u9760\u6587\u5b57\u6765\u5c55\u73b0\uff0c\u4e0b\u6307\u4ee4\u53ea\u9700\u8981\u6309\u51e0\u4e2a\u952e\uff0c\u602a\u4e5f\u4e0d\u96be\u6253\uff0c\u53ef\u60dc\u6709\u4e0d\u5c11\u8bcd\u4e0d\u8ba4\u8bc6\uff0c\u53ea\u597d\u62b1\u7740\u8bcd\u5178\u73a9", "timestamp_created": 1456391921, "timestamp_updated": 1456391921, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21428291": {"recommendationid": "21428291", "author": {"steamid": "76561198167893538", "num_games_owned": 112, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 772, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502760078}, "language": "english", "review": "Got this on sale!

There's a reason the softcore difficulty level is Not Recommended. Like all Roguelike games, you learn from every failure. It really makes you question what's actually a failure, and what's just a learning experience for next time.\nI love the art style in this game so much. It's amazing what you can do with a little imagination, creative sound effects, and the ASCII system. It's simple, but it drives your imagination into overdrive. With a few keystrokes, some extremely fitting music, sound effects, and imagination, I go from sitting in front of a very detailed text-based battle to a heart-pounding fight for my life.\n\nFair warning, while I thoroughly recommend this game to all rpg lovers and especially people who have a taste for classic-style games, this game is one hell of a drug. I dream it, I see it in real life now, and, most importantly, I will never look at potatoes the same way ever, ever, EVER again.", "timestamp_created": 1456209921, "timestamp_updated": 1456209921, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21397214": {"recommendationid": "21397214", "author": {"steamid": "76561197982951958", "num_games_owned": 268, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 358, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1456599302}, "language": "english", "review": "Now this is a real game!", "timestamp_created": 1456191882, "timestamp_updated": 1456191882, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21392691": {"recommendationid": "21392691", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034885949", "num_games_owned": 531, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 31, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1455912949}, "language": "english", "review": "I havent gotten around to playing it much, but it honeslty is a really unique game i could sink many hours in", "timestamp_created": 1456172417, "timestamp_updated": 1456172417, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495349", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21388782": {"recommendationid": "21388782", "author": {"steamid": "76561197986525430", "num_games_owned": 121, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 567, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1456152774}, "language": "english", "review": "The ASCII art and music are good, but the game itself quicly becomes stale and repetitive.

It is pretty a pretty straight forward average to below average game compared to past games such as this.  Depth is the main issue.  You get many places to go in your \"town\" area and things to do, but not much below the surface in regards to changing a very linear path on your adventure.  You become powerful, go from area A to B to C, but the little there is as far as side quests really do nothing to affect the story or change your path.  Lots of things to do that really don't affect a linear path of the adventure is not depth...it is grinding.\n\nI would not have minded the perma-death so much if it did not seem that in certain sitiuations you get 1, maybe two shot by MOB and done.  I would understand if the risk/reward was there, but not when your character level is within the mid to high range of the area you are in expected level with no chance to get out and playing the average \"classic\" level.   Take all my gold, bump me down half my levels and make me work back up, but not a 1 shot have a nice day why did I buy the good stuff if it won't protect me at all kind of way.\n\nFor the sale price I paid I would say it is worth it in a waste a few bucks on an arcade game type of way.  If they included a reload from a save point or a more dynamic you were one shot but the goddess of that sucks, but I will save you with a penalty in classic mode were added.  Give me a better branching story, side quests, where I don't feel only one road to the end with a rest stop here and there and would definitely pay full price or more.\n\nI appreciate the attempt as just don't find this kind of game much anymore.

It eschews accessibility in favor of being at times deliberately obtuse.  It is truly \"oldschool\" in a very real sense rather than simply appealing to the \"8-Bit\" aesthetic.  I think those of us that like the game most were probably those that played text-based adventures in glorious monochrome.  Or played countless sessions of Legend of the Red Dragon on ancient and likely now extinct BBSes.  Or engaged in awkward roleplay at 3am on some forsaken MUD out there.\n\nIf you understand any of that at all, then this is the game for you.  You are also probably like me, getting old, and seeing a game like this helps you convince yourself the things you enjoyed in yesteryear are NOT in fact entirely irrelevant!\n\nIf, on the otherhand, you didn't understand any of that but still have an appreciation for ASCII art, catchy beep-boopy music, and grind heavy RPG mechanics, then you too may find this game worthwhile.  Whippersnapper.\n\nAll of the gameplay consists of entering (mostly one character) commands as highlighted on the current screen.  At first, most of this will be simply an encounter crawl, a series of battles using a handful of attacks and abilities.  Combat is turn based and text heavy.  You need to pay close attention to both your own and your enemy's condition, and carefully chain together your attacks and simultaneously avoid the power attacks of your enemy.  There is a very definite rhythm to it all, and you can die very easily if you don't master it.\n\nAs you progress, you will unlock an increasing amount of side-activites and quests.  These involve running a tavern, expanding your player home, mining iron, crafting gear, arena battles and random dungeons, among many other things.  However, despite the number of activities the end result is mostly about gaining gold, XP, or a RNG item reward.  Speaking of RNG, I hope you like it or at least tolerate it, because this game uses it [i]heavily[/i].  As a result, it pays to invest points in a few different weapon proficiencies as it can be difficult to come across a good weapon of the one specific type that you want.\n\nApart from the ASCII graphics, which are fairly attractive but also not the best I've seen, there is also a very complementary soundtrack that is very retro-inspired without being too chip-tuney.  If you have a sweet tooth for nostalgia, prepare your mouth for cavities.\n\nLast, but not least, is the humor of the game.  There are plots and sub-plots to unravel, but most of that is lost in the extremely silly and \"le random\" type of humor in the narrative.  I actually found it pretty amusing for the most part, but boy oh boy am I tired of seeing the word \"potato\".\n\n[i]Grab your Potato and roll a character if you...[/i]\n\n[list]\n\n[*] Used to play BBS doors.  Seriously, just buy it already.  The only thing lacking here would be the competitive multi-player, but this otherwise could be mistaken for a BBS classic.\n\n[*] Love grindey, RNG-ey, numbery RPG-ey gameplay.\n\n[*] Can't get enough of retro ASCII type stuff.\n\n[*] Have an unhealthy fixation on potatoes that causes you to rub them all over your body in exchange for gifts from strangers.\n\n[/list]\n\n[i]Press (N) to (N)ope out of this one if you...[/i]\n\n[list]\n\n[*] Have no interest in retro ASCII whatsoever.  There's, uh, not gonna be much for you to look at.\n\n[*] Loathe nonsensical humor. POTATO LOL SO RANDOM!!!1!11\n\n[*] Have requirements for gameplay that involve anything other than navigating menu screens.\n\n[*] Hate grinding, because that's kinda the focus here.\n\n[*] Feel that the only fit use for potatoes is food, not weaponry, companionship, objects of worship, or pleasure.\n\n[/list]\n\n[u]The Bottom Line[/u]\n\nAlthough this game gets \"Overwhelmingly Positive\" reviews, and despite the fact that I recommend it myself, it is actually [i]not[/i] for everyone.  I personally love it as a throwback to mostly forgotten games of the past, for the ASCII art, for the fun assortment of grinding activities, and even for the heavily potato-based humor.  However, I can easily see all of those things being negatives for another person.  One man's potato is another man's radish, or so the old saying probably goes.\n\nFor my part, the only thing I really felt missing is a solid multiplayer aspect.  Most of the great BBS door games of old were heavily competitive beyond simple leaderboard rankings.  It often entailed a lot of direct PvP, raids, and even things like ship combat and kingdom warfare.\n\nI'd love to see a sequel to Sanctuary that kept the single-player grinding and expanded upon it with competitive multiplayer activites.

Play it for at least 10-15 hours to truly appreciate it. 9/10.\n\nPros:\n-Beautiful ASCII art\n-Wonderful soundtrack\n-In-depthmechanics and gradual learning curve\n-An old-school roguelike that is not a clone of Angband/Nethack/ADOM\n-Funny\n-Good crafting system\n-Solid RPG elements\n-Good replayability\n\nCons:\n-It could do with some more content and rebalancing\n-The story is a bit lacking\n-The encounters (events) can get a bit too random\n\nPossible caveats (i.e. things you might either love or hate):\n-Absolutely unforgiving (in non-softcore modes)\n-Repetitive combat (it's a design choice, but it can get frustrating)\n-The community is rather small\n-Very different from Angband/Nethack/ADOM, and somewhat less in-depth\n-No new-school roguelike progression (a la Rogue Legacy), but progressing in the game will unlock new options\n-It has a weird obsession with potatoes\n\nDetailed review:\n\nSanctuary RPG is an ASCII roguelike that does not follow the steps of Angband/ADOM/Nethack, so if that is what you are expecting you might be disappointed. The exploration is done via menu choices, rather than moving your character around a map, and so is the combat, dialogue, and pretty much everything else. The immersion is achieved, instead, through some rather stunning ASCII art, an absolutely outstanding soundtrack, and various interactions with enemies and NPCs. The game mechanics, and various menus, are complex enough to keep things interesting throughout the game, but not so much to become overwhelming; this is also achieved by new features, skills, and areas becoming gradually available as your character levels up.\n\nIf what you are missing, however, is the unforgiving nature of old roguelikes, then look no further. Sanctuary RPG looks deceptively friendly at first, with its light humour and digestible chunks of text, but the moment you get distracted or overconfident, you're dead, no mater how overpowered you felt ten seconds ago. The game is rather difficult to master, not because the underlying mechanics are complicated, but because you have to be very careful with all your decisions, just like in any old roguelike worth its salt. I have played it for over 20 hours and never managed to get past act 2. For those looking for a less frustrating experience, the game also has a softcore mode, with reduced loot drops and no permadeath.\n\nAs some reviewers have mentioned, the combat does get a bit repetitive, again, like in any old-school roguelike, and that is exactly how most of my characters meet their untimely demise: I get distracted and miss a crucial step to heal or use an ability. This is a design choice, I believe, and one I understand and accept, however much it frustrates me to lose my precious wizards to it again and again.\n\nSome of the text could do with a spell check, but there are no major grammatical mistakes, just a couple of sentences here and there that sound a bit odd. As much as the content has grown and been improved over the last year or so, I would love to see more dialogue choices for the NPCs you meet in every adventure, as those get a bit old after a while and lack depth. I also feel that some of the randomly generated loot needs a bit of a rebalance, but that may also be a design choice to prevent characters from getting too strong too quickly.\n\nI think my main gripe is with the small size of the community that plays this game. It is very difficult to find guides, and even the wiki is barely there. As such, it is rather difficult to compare strategies with other players. Many players seem to abandon this game after a few hours, which I think isn't anough to fully appreciate it. And while it is fun, and in-theme with the old-school roguelike vibe (I didn't have walkthroughs for Angband back in the 90s!) to discover the game by trial and error, sometimes it also gets a bit frustrating.\n\nAll in all, however, I truly love this game. It's balanced, it's fun, and it's unforgiving in a very familiar way, while also being surprisingly innovative. If any of its elements appeal to you, you can't go wrong for that price, give it a chance. And get the soundtrack too! :)", "timestamp_created": 1450639985, "timestamp_updated": 1450738274, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.659273", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19690445": {"recommendationid": "19690445", "author": {"steamid": "76561198133003017", "num_games_owned": 108, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 772, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1450636245}, "language": "english", "review": "Buy this if you like potatoes.", "timestamp_created": 1450079873, "timestamp_updated": 1450079873, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19668411": {"recommendationid": "19668411", "author": {"steamid": "76561198226541308", "num_games_owned": 80, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 1019, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 49, "last_played": 1513297414}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a cheap timewaster, and a pretty good one at that.", "timestamp_created": 1449987559, "timestamp_updated": 1513011766, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19628367": {"recommendationid": "19628367", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068677501", "num_games_owned": 100, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 392, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1449800858}, "language": "english", "review": "Old school fun.", "timestamp_created": 1449829742, "timestamp_updated": 1449829742, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19626125": {"recommendationid": "19626125", "author": {"steamid": "76561198102009876", "num_games_owned": 41, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1207, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479791529}, "language": "english", "review": "Barely started, got bit in the crotch several times by multiple dragonflies/possible mosquitoes.

Set your nostalgia back to the 80s because Sanctuary returns us to the days of IBM floppy disk playstyle, but adds all the swish new techniques of today's slickest MUDs. \nThe RPG elements are top notch and more often than not innovative over today's AAA games. The character class combinations are incredibly fun. The system is easy enough to understand, so one is never bogged down with endless cumbersome keyboard commands. The controls make sense, are to the point, displayed on the screen and turn-based, so you can learn at your own pace. The risk factor makes the game feel very realistic and often even frightening. Charming townspeople and chilling dungeons alike await intrepid adventurers. The music is wonderful and worth buying as a DLC. It evokes feelings of old Nobuo Uematsu fantasies with lots of crunchy nintendo blip goodness. The graphics may seem simple, but they are incredibly complex and beautiful. Just try to draw these yourself! Every monster and treasure is well rendered in ASCII and better than 3D graphics in this case, as it allows the player to imagine a fair amount of the world as well. \nCrafting is great. Quests are enjoyable. The fightng is damned fun. The limit break system is dynamic and carries over across battles. Stored TP can then be used for difficult battles, opening up with that devastating special attack. That's just one small example of how complex the battling is. All the while, it never gets hard to control, overwhelming, or confusing... but don't go thinking this roguelike holds yer hand, it does not. The player is soon plunged into a world of danger & excitement. I fear for my characters' lives. Their experiences feel very real.\nBlack Edition is wicked & well polished.

As others have mentioned, this game brings to mind the ASCII multiplayer games like Legend of the Red Dragon, and my favorite, Usurper, that were popular back when Doom II and 56k dial-up connections were cutting edge technology.  But I digress, I'll list the pros and cons I personally found while playing this game, while rating each (+ to +++, - to ---) on how enjoyable or unenjoyable it is:\n\n[b][u][i]Pros[/i][/u][/b]\n[list]\n[*][b]Soundtrack[/b] (+++) - The soundtrack for this game is amazing.  The intro theme instantly caught my attention as I started the game for the first, and every subsequent time.  I can't actually name a song that I don't enjoy.  The tavern theme is good, most of the fight and boss songs are also great.  There are piano renditions of the songs available as free DLC which can be found in the game's folder, and they are equally awesome.\n\n[*][b]Gameplay[/b] (++) - The gameplay is highly addictive.  There are so many things to do in addition to the main storyline.  You can mine for ore to make items, read randomly generated library books and hope you get exp, upgrade your home, do side-quests for townsfolk, craft items for a chance at better equipment, fight in an arena, go through randomly generated teleports for harder monsters/better loot, the list goes on.  A lot of the crafting/searching requires energy, which refills as you do normal fights, giving a nice balance of grinding mixed with many other fun side jobs to keep the repetition as minimal as possible.\n\n[*][b]Combat[/b] (++) - Considering you will spend a good portion of your time battling, it's a good thing that combat is for the most part enjoyable, despite the lack of graphics or animations.  In fact, there are many games with graphics and animations that have a less in-depth system than SRPG has.  Typically you will use the 1-4 keys to perform various combos with different moves, in such an order that you are creating combos with a starter move, chain moves, then a finisher.  Each class also has a heal move, and learns other moves such as an ultimate attack, stackable shields, ways to block enemy power attacks, etc.  There is one annoyance I have with combat, but that will be discussed in the cons.\n\n[*][b]Story/Writing[/b] (++) - While I haven't beaten the game, the storyline is fairly generic in terms of plot.  However, the writing is solid and there is quite a bit of humor to the story.  It all begins with the backstory you are given about your character after you create him or her, which is pretty much a randomly generated mad-lib story with random events describing your character, and is pretty amusing most of the time.  This game also loves potatoes for some reason.  You will encounter potatoes as a random event, you will find weapons with \"potato\" in the name, then you will find items that can boost your weapon if it has \"potato\" in it's name, which few do.  I give this two +s for having humor and being well-written, despite the aforementioned generic plot.\n[/list]\n[b][u][i]Cons[/i][/u][/b]\n[list]\n[*][b]Combat[/b] (-) - As I mentioned above, combat is a mostly enjoyable experience.  There is, however, quite a bit of grinding that must be done to build up your character.  While this isn't too bad, the personal issue I have with this is that I tend to start spamming attacks fairly quickly (1, enter, 2, enter, 3, enter, 3, enter, check hps, heal or repeat).  95% of the time this works.  The problem with getting into this groove is most monsters have a perk or two from a nice-sized list of perks you can view the effects of by typing \"?\" into the battle.  You must pay attention to what bonuses your opponents have.  Some of these perks can be devastating, including one that instantly reduces your max HP by 50% for the entire battle (this can be especially bad against bosses that have insane hps, ensuring you will be fighting them for quite some time), or one that constantly drains almost all of your MP/Rage/Ultimate.  I've had monsters with Gigantic (deals major damage to you often) also have the Caustic (player starts with 50% max hps) or Punishing (deals 50% more damage if player is lower than 50% hps) perks, and kill what I felt was a fairly powerful character in 2-3 hits because I wasn't paying attention.  In this game, one death means you have to restart (unless you play Softcore).  I guess if you pay more attention than I do, this won't be an issue, but it's very easy to get into the habit of hitting the same keys over and over.\n[/list]\n\nOverall an amazingly fun game.  You can pick it up for a few minutes, or a few hours, and no matter how much or little you do, will feel as if you've improved.

Set your nostalgia back to the 80s because Sanctuary returns us to the days of IBM floppy disk playstyle, but adds all the swish new techniques of today's slickest MUDs.  \nThe RPG elements are top notch and more often than not innovative over today's AAA games.  The character class combinations are incredibly fun.  The system is easy enough to understand, so one is never bogged down with endless cumbersome keyboard commands.  The controls make sense, are to the point, displayed on the screen and turn-based, so you can learn at your own pace.  The risk factor makes the game feel very realistic and often even frightening.  Charming townspeople and chilling dungeons alike await intrepid adventurers.  The music is wonderful and worth buying as a DLC.  It evokes feelings of old Nobuo Uematsu fantasies with lots of crunchy nintendo blip goodness.  The graphics may seem simple, but they are incredibly complex and beautiful.  Just try to draw these yourself!  Every monster and treasure is well rendered in ASCII and better than 3D graphics in this case, as it allows the player to imagine a fair amount of the world as well.  \nCrafting is great.  Quests are enjoyable.  The fightng is damned fun.  The limit break system is dynamic and carries over across battles.  Stored TP can then be used for difficult battles, opening up with that devastating special attack.  That's just one small example of how complex the battling is.  All the while, it never gets hard to control, overwhelming, or confusing...  but don't go thinking this roguelike holds yer hand, it does not.

Drawing heavy inspiration from both Roguelikes and Japanese RPGs, the game offers a robust action-RPG inspired combat system.\n\n[h1]The Story[/h1]\nYou know those old B movies you saw at the drive-in, or those old sci-fi flicks that are now in the Public Domain? SanctuaryRPG is like that, and it is meant to be that. It doesn\u2019t try and be some AAA game produced by some ridiculously large studio. No, SanctuaryRPG is a wonderful mess of self-deprecating satire, and that\u2019s what makes it so perfect for a text-based RPG.\n\n[b]Story Verdict[/b]: The precise formula for a comedic, but intriguing, story that\u2019ll keep you enticed.\n[b]Story Score[/b]: 9/10\n\n[h1]The Graphics[/h1]\nNo, I\u2019m not going to tell you that the graphics are terrible because there\u2019s no fancy SSAA or SSAO. SanctuaryRPG relishes in the wonderful world of ASCII art that is detailed and beautiful. Not only that but the game manages to include secrets within the backdrop of symbols that fit naturally. It works, and it works wonderfully!\n\n[b]Graphics Verdict[/b]: Simple and old-school graphics are a throwback to a forgotten era of games.\n[b]Graphics Score[/b]: 9/10\n\n[h1]The Controls[/h1]\nYou can play the whole game with a keyboard, and at no time are controls hidden behind memory. It might take a little time to get used to because of the mechanics, but you are never timed in your decisions. They nailed down solid controls that work well and are always visible.\n\n[b]Controls Verdict[/b]: Simple to use and never hidden.\n[b]Controls Score[/b]: 9/10\n\n[h1]The Sounds[/h1]\nA myriad of old and newer sounds come together to form the nostalgic, synth-ridden soundtrack of SanctuaryRPG. It\u2019s fun, engaging, and varies enough to keep things fresh during your various adventures. On top of the soundtrack you have the familiar sound effects one would expect from a text-based RPG.\n\n[b]Sounds Verdict[/b]: It\u2019s honestly a really nice soundtrack with some great sound effects to go along with it. It fits well!\n[b]Sounds Score[/b]: 8.5/10\n\n[h1]The Difficulty[/h1]\nAs with any rogue-like game, SanctuaryRPG\u2019s difficulty lies in both skill and learning from your mistakes. It does this quite fairly, and with the right planning one is able to go far without worry of some nonsensical one-hit kill or unfair mechanic. There are always humorous things that can happen against your favour, but I think that\u2019s part of the charm. I found my time with SanctuaryRPG to be balanced and fair, but still always difficult.\n\n[b]Difficulty Verdict[/b]: Just the right amount of reward for just the right amount of saltiness!\n[b]Difficulty Score[/b]: 9/10\n\n[h1]Replayability[/h1]\nOne could say that a single hour of gameplay is not enough to judge the scale of an RPG like this game, but do not be fooled; I have spent many more hours on this game without Steam. I can assure you that SanctuaryRPG is deep and offers such a large variety of gameplay and fun that it\u2019s worth twice the price to me (at least). \n\nThere\u2019s a unique crafting system that is unlike many other RPGs where you have to manage the heat, quality, and durability of an item. You can also run your own tavern; yeah, you can literally become an inn-keeper if you\u2019d like. You can purchase a house too, or fight in the arena!\n\n[b]Replayability Verdict[/b]: More replayability than games asking for over five times as much money!\n[b]Replayability Score[/b]: 10/10\n\n\n[h1]Overall Verdict[/h1]\nHuge amounts of gameplay, hilarious story, and engaging graphics give you the most successful nostalgic trip back to the old text-based RPGs of the 80s. I couldn\u2019t recommend this game more, and I consider it one of my favourite RPG games of all time!\n\n[h1]Overall Score: 9.5/10[/h1]\n", "timestamp_created": 1439366908, "timestamp_updated": 1439366908, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.456075", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17481288": {"recommendationid": "17481288", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003019803", "num_games_owned": 643, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1262, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1439697871}, "language": "english", "review": "I actually cried when my character died 10 hours in. 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1439255465, "timestamp_updated": 1439255465, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17456122": {"recommendationid": "17456122", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065285327", "num_games_owned": 118, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 2097, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497892514}, "language": "english", "review": "If you want to play really Hardcore RPG game, this is what you seek for! 300 levels, cool plot, really low minimum requirements (!) and TONS of dead heroes and restarts!!!

I know that there is a softcore mode, but that mode makes it way too easy as their is very little punishment for dying contrary to what the mode description says. I would give this game a 9/10 or maybe even 10/10 if it wasn't for the permanant death.

Death can be fun, death is a learning experience, etc. However, it's all relative to the amount of grind that it took to take you up to that death. The first dozen hours or so of SanctuaryRPG are full of so many learning opportunities, that all those many hours spent fighting and crafting weren't a grind at all. But after that point, death becomes frustratingly expensive, because of how many dozens of hours the game can span. This in turn, actually encourages even more grind to the point of getting your character over-leveled for a particular area, as a safety barrier to protect from dying all over again. And there will come fights that completely blindside you from where you completely overwhelmed the previous fight, so there's very little available to signal danger to you until it is far too late.\n\nAll that said, though, despite my frustrations with the circumstances surrounding death, learning how to play and experiencing SanctuaryRPG for the first time was a great experience, and frankly a steal at $8.", "timestamp_created": 1435210363, "timestamp_updated": 1435210363, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504331", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16668324": {"recommendationid": "16668324", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030606872", "num_games_owned": 277, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 600, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1460088218}, "language": "english", "review": "SanctuaryRPG: Black Edition, is a masterpiece in it's own right.\n\n30 minutes into the game and I knew I loved it.

Definitely better than any JRPG that you'll ever have to grind for.\n\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1435124949, "timestamp_updated": 1435124949, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16665819": {"recommendationid": "16665819", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078073193", "num_games_owned": 1108, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 49, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492852338}, "language": "english", "review": "I got this game DRM free and played around 300 hours , this game is one of my favorite RPGs I have ever played.", "timestamp_created": 1435113708, "timestamp_updated": 1435113708, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502663", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16664380": {"recommendationid": "16664380", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052279429", "num_games_owned": 218, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1924, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501965693}, "language": "french", "review": "Je fais rarement des \u00e9valuations mais ce jeu est un vrai coup de coeur notamment  lorsque j'ai fini par comprendre comment charger une sauvegarde. :p \nCertes niveau graphiques ce n'est pas tr\u00e8s developp\u00e9 mais peu importe tant que le jeu se d\u00e9roule (pour moi).

I played lots of door games, had a BBS myself, and been active on various BBSes for a good number of years, starting with a 2400 baud modem and going all the way up to 56k, then broadband.\n\nI saw SanctuaryRPG suggested to me, and as soon as I saw the store video, saying this was Steam's first ASCII game, and saw the very nice ASCII graphics indeed, I was sold instantly.  I didn't looked up the reviews, nor checked the forums, I didn't even expanded the more info on the game.  I just bought it. \n\nSo when I tried it, I had the biggest surprise of my life... this game is pure genius.  Only with a text game you could come up with such a brilliant, deep, very deep, combat system.   Yeah, you heard me right, this text game has better combat than all graphic games out there.  And yet, you see nothing of the combat itself.  I won't spoil it, but it's real good.\n\nDon't be fooled, its no rogue-like in the common sense, you aren't a letter on a grid, and move one square at a time, with enemy moving after you.

The art is honestly very good for ASCII, and the minimalist style allows for greater focus on the solid combat mechanics that make up the core of the game. As well, you will immediately notice the incredibly high quality chip tune inspired sound track, which is also allowed greater brain share as the graphics are less attention demanding during combat and dialogue.\n\nThere are 6 classes which all interact with the basic set of commands available differently. Barbarians heal while doing damage better than other classes, Wizards put up Barriers that increase their defense and offense, Rangers shoot and stab things to death while nimbly avoiding damage, etc...\n\nOn top of this, there is a vibrant meta-game layer in which you can own a bar, build a house, become a master crafter of various items (this system is VERY well done), go to the Colosseum and use the Arena (fight for crafting materials), explore Portals (fight for great loot), and do Ranked Matchmaking (fight for Skill points).\n\nIf you can deal with perma-death, this game should not be passed up. Fights tend to be fair and you will realize quickly what you're doing wrong after the first few deaths. It does have a mode where death is not permanent as well, though, if that is really a deal breaker for you.\n\n11/10 Potatos", "timestamp_created": 1434462291, "timestamp_updated": 1434462468, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16437011": {"recommendationid": "16437011", "author": {"steamid": "76561197963643798", "num_games_owned": 347, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 122, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1434593569}, "language": "english", "review": "There is something amazingly zen about this game.", "timestamp_created": 1434438111, "timestamp_updated": 1434438111, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16433811": {"recommendationid": "16433811", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029853627", "num_games_owned": 213, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 2997, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477535882}, "language": "english", "review": "This game has been on my wishlist since it was released.

RPG. RPG.\n\n- Feature to turn off dialog exists if you find it too annoying.\n\n- It is text, it takes seconds to get in to battle from startup. This makes it perfect for both casual and in-depth gaming sessions.\n\n- You die, game over. Each battle plays out in different ways.

It's just loaded with so much to do and it presents those things to you a little at a time so you don't feel overwhelmed at the start. Not to mention the music is absolutely stellar. It couldn't possibly be any more fitting. \nThe battle system is really interesting. In most RPG's your best tactic is to just use your best spell or ability and spam attacks until the enemy is dead. This game is different in that you have several meters you need to keep track of and you're given a multitude of special attacks to perform to either ramp up your meters or spend it all on devastating blows. You use certain attacks in a sequence to unleash combos, filling up your meters, your health bar, and laying down the hurt at the same time. You're given multiple combos you can perform, each having their own uses. You will also need to keep track of when you need to shift spots or defend. The enemy telegraphs charging attacks, giving you enough turns to ramp up your defense or get ready with heals. They can also leave your guard wide open, forcing you to reposition to gain footing and get your defense back. These are just the standard methods of battling for all classes. Each class gets extra abilities to go along with this to compliment all their playstyles. Seems like a lot but it's something you get used to quickly. The game is especially good at dishing you new things in small doses to make sure everything you learn sticks and you don't get overwhelmed with knowledge. A great example of teaching a player how to play your game that every game developer should practice.\nThe people making this game are very, very talented.

I love the format and am willing to accept a lot of drawbacks for a good, immersive Roguelike experience. I even put 150 hours into Rogue's Tale, an unfair and punishing Roguelike solely due to how challenging it was. \n\nSanctuaryRPG isn't really a Roguelike, as much as it likes to say it is. It's really just a loot grind. \n\n Is the loot I just found/made better than what I have? \n Yes? Equip it. Scrap old item to get more materials to craft loot.\n No? Scrap it. Get more materials to craft loot. \n Repeat Forever\n\nThe Town Hub could have been a neat idea, but it's too static. Nothing really changes. Go to the Blacksmith every so often to look at more gear. Go to the Market if you need a missing material. Go to the Library for a bit of exp every so often. Go to the campground to dig for loot...\n\nBasically, between the loot grind, go visit each place in the town hub for more loot or exp. Go back and fight random encounters. Repeat forever.\n\nNow, I say forever, but this is where the biggest fundamental flaw of SanctuaryRPG lies: The game is ridiculously easy in such a way that you play on autopilot until you realize you accidentally died because you've been playing on autopilot and you now have to start over. \n\nSure, you can crank the combat difficulty up, but that doesn't seem to do much. \n\nThe combat system is a neat idea and really the only interesting thing SanctuaryRPG brings to the table. There's a combo system and ability system that's pretty interesting. Big points for that piece. But the rest of the game doesn't do anything new or interesting.\n\nOne of the other flaws in the game is that the ramp up, for a roguelike with permadeath, is way too long. I played 2 sessions of this game, both times into Act 2 before autopilot-mistake killed me about 3 hours in. That's way too long for the \"introduction\" period for a Roguelike. You can take off Permadeath to negate this, however, if you don't play with Permadeath some features of the game are locked down and progression is even slower.\n\nThe story is awful and the humor is just referential. If you're a fan of when a game says, \"Hey, look! The cake is a lie! We just made a reference! Aren't we funny and edgy?!\", then you'll enjoy the humor in this game.\n\nI wish you could rate a \"meh\" as opposed to up or down, but I really can't recommend this game. \n\nTl; dr: Diablo-Style loot grind on Hardcore mode that's so ridiculously easy you'll mindlessly autopilot the game until something instagibs you because you weren't paying 100% attention.\n\nHow is that fun?", "timestamp_created": 1425038047, "timestamp_updated": 1425038693, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 104, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.660018", "comment_count": "9", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14669392": {"recommendationid": "14669392", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008593284", "num_games_owned": 178, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1091, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495685365}, "language": "english", "review": "I love ASCII games, but this one is crap.

You start of this game creating a character. Selecting between various races/classes/weapon styles and more. After that you'll select between hardcore mode (die once and you lose your character) or casual mode. Then your adventure starts into this wacky ascii world filled with enemy encounters, silly dialogue and lot of random loot. Just like in Diablo you will get that feeling of glee when you find another epic or even legendary piece of equipment.\n\nGraphicly the game is .. text based. I grew up past the whole textbased era of games but for it only being text it looks good. For me it doesn't add or detract anything to the game.\n\nThe music is a great feature of this game. Every tune just fits the scene. For example the blacksmith theme has a blacksmith hammer clanging with the tune and it sounds awesome. There are a lot of various battle themes (all of them sound great) which is important because you will be battling 80% of your time in the game.\n\nOne of the things I disliked about the game was how you lose all progress when you die.

It plays more like an interactive text game (like zork for example) but with less freedom and knowing where you're going more instead of spamming north until something interesting happens or waiting whilst thorin starts singing about gold.\n\nThe combat system looks really complicated and it is, you have starting moves, linking moves and finishing moves. You're meant to use a starter then a linking move and then a finisher unlocks which you can use for extra damage or something. there is also relocating so if an enemy is about to charge you or something then you can relocate and the enemys charge cancels. There are also rage attacks but I have no idea how it works.\n\nThis game is packed with references to fantasy/Sci-FI films and games Like the lord of the rings, the game also seems to have an unhealthy obsession with potatoes (seriously the second weapon I picked up was a potatoe staff). and the game makes me laugh in normal conversation with the NPC's saying stupid things or breaking the fourth wall. Once during some \"Mountain Exploration\" I came across some \"Random Onions\" and my options were 1) boil 'em 2) mash 'em 3) sitck 'em in a stew Which was a hilarious nod to lord of the rings (well I found it pretty funny at least).\n\nThe soundtrack is pretty good and it made me feel weird actualy like I was tripping out or something and I couldn't help feeling disconnected from everything but the game immersing me in its rather ridiculous world.\n\nThe ASCII art of the different characters is really good too even on the enemies the same jumbled letters, numbers and symbols put together are different each time and I even saw a skeleton that looks like Megadeths mascot \"Vic Rattlehead\" although I don't know if that was intentional (Megadeth is a Thrash Metal band that was famous throughout the 80's and 90's). \n\nOverall the game is really good although i'm probably biased because i'm a sucker for roguelikes.\n\nI score the game a solid 9/10 If you like good storytelling and

Like many of my Steam purchases, I was fully prepared for this to entertain me for a single play session and to be quickly forgotten. I was not prepared for how immediately engaging this game would be.\n\nDIFFICULTY\nI continually feel rewarded by the frequent leveling and item drops. I was never in any doubt that my character was growing increasingly more powerful with every action taken, and I've never felt the need to grind levels or gear. Despite this being true across my playthroughs, the game never allows me to be careless. Any encounter could easily result in my death which, in Classic mode, is permanent. For me, there is a perfect balance between reward and challenge in this game.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nIn addition to advancing the story, there are various side tasks that can be performed often, but not constantly, including crafting, management, fetch quests, and battles. I did not ignore any of these since they provide experience and offer a nice diversion. I'm not sure if the core gameplay might become a bit monotonous if I ignored all of these side tasks.\n\nLENGTH\nI have not succeeded in beating the game yet, but I'd estimate that an average, successful playthrough would take 2-4 hours depending on familiarity with the game mechanics and progression. Keep in mind though that this estimate is based on the assumption that I've made it to the final encounter of the game.\n\nSTORY & WRITING\nIt's too soon for me to accurately say, but the story seems to be entirely linear. This could be considered a negative to some due to the game's length and permadeath feature. A softcore game type is option, but this seems to prevent unlocking some game options. In my opinion though, the story is very well written and there likely would have been a quality drop if it had been branching or randomized. The flavor text that is included with battles and other interactions has been entertaining and varied enough to me to keep me looking forward to reading it.\n\nSOUND\nI appreciate the retro-inspiration and found the music to be very, very enjoyable. Sound effects are about what I expected, though there are situations where a battle end sound effect seems to be missing, which briefly takes me out of the experience.\n\nREPLAYABILITY & VALUE\nOnce I beat the game, I'm not sure if I will immediately start playing with a new class or if I will move on to another game, but I know that I'll have enjoyed every hour spent during that playthrough and would gladly pay $7.99 again if I had to do it over.\n\nUpdate on game length: I completed Act 3 in about 3.5 hours as a Barbarian.

I downloaded it back then (it is freeware) and fell in love with it.  Black Edition (paid now) adds more content, better art, more races, more class perks, mercenaries, faction system, etc.\n\nThis is a turn-based rogue-like RPG with surprisingly deep content.  Combat requires you to always pay attention.  Is the enemy getting ready to charge you?  Are you snared?  What sort of special modifiers does this enemy have?  What debuffs have I got & can I get rid of them (is it worth it)?\n\nThere's a few different places for combat to take place, too.  You can just be out in the fields encountering enemies, pressing forward with the story, in one of the 'randomly generated' dungeons from the Colloseum or taking part in ranked matches in the colloseum.  I'm not really far into this edition, so there might be more later.. Who knows.\n\nBesides combat there are other things to do!  You can take over a bar and serve the patrons to try and get gifts, spend cash to upgrade it & draw more patrons, get cheaper beer, etc.  There's a sort-of house building mechanic where you can gradually upgrade your camping ground to a hut, shack, cabin, etc.  A great crafting system that reminds me of the system in Final Fantasy XIV.  Plenty of amusing 'events' that take place!  See a syringe on the ground?  Yes, you have the option of picking it up and injecting yourself.  Come across a cow?  You can kiss that thing.\n\nThe caveat of this game is that it is entirely text.  All the art is ASCII art (and it's great) - this means it's definitely not for everyone, but I HIGHLY recommend everyone at least give the freeware version a shot (this might just be a demo now.. Google for it), and if you like it.. Pick up the Black Edition.\n\nI highly recommend this game, but am willing to admit that it is probably not for the majority of gamers.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1424100191, "timestamp_updated": 1424100191, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14499486": {"recommendationid": "14499486", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051886387", "num_games_owned": 631, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 78, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1424125125}, "language": "english", "review": "I've only played for a bit, and haven't advanced much into it, but so far I'm loving it.

An easy-to-play, surprisingly complex and deep humorous RPG with a retro text-graphic aesthetic.  A bargain at the price, it provides plenty of challenge delivered with humor.\n\nSanctualyRPG is probably best summed up as \"far more than it seems.\"\n\nAt first it seems like an attempt to do a retro RPG, with graphics consisting entirely of text characters and simple controls and character management.  Very quickly you realize this game is the very summary of \"more than the sum of its parts.\"\n\nCharacters?  Well you pick a class and races, and then level up various attributes and skills.  However the traits, the attributes and skills you chose, have a variety of effects in game.  They're even more pronounced when combined with equipment.\n\nThat Equiment?  There's armor, shields, charms, and a variety of weapons with assorted randomized traits and stat boosts.  You're never quite sure what you're going to find or make, and surprises abound.\n\nCrafting?  Oh, you'll get plenty of that.   You'll collect and salvage various resources to make weapons, armor, and more.  You even unlock more crafting options over time, giving you more to do back at camp.\n\nCamp?  You get a camp to start with, and are able to upgrade your home, mine, and of course make items.  When you're done you can leave to visit other areas in Sanctuary.\n\nThese other Areas provide plenty to do, from shopping to visiting a library to fighting in an Arena or in procedural dungeons.  They even have a few surprises.\n\nOh and there's actually a story behind all this.  Often silly and loaded with potatoes, sometimes gruesome and sad, and always driving you forward.  It even comes in acts so you know how far along you are.\n\nThis, you'll note, is even before you get to adventuring.\n\nAdventuring is pretty simple - go to an area, something random happens, and occasionally a secret area or exploration option will appear.  Youi'll usually meet monsters, but also can find yourself accomplishing various silly tasks or finding treasure.  Though you may have to climb a statue or dance with a golem to get it.\n\nCombat is a combo-based and status-effect based system.  Building combos unlocks more attacks, and status effects can provide vital differences.  You can build up powerful attacks, and acquire more and more abilities over time.  Juggling them in proper order - and the proper sequence to handle various enemies - is of utmost importance.   You have to pay attention to a variety of factors, and most combats are pretty involving as your HP, statuses, and MP fluctuate with choices.\n\nOn top of all of this there's different difficulty levels and unlockables, so the more you play, the more there is to do.\n\nThe entire package is a fun, addictive, clever game that I'd have happily paid twice the price for.  If you like good RPGs, want one you can play for a few minutes or for hours, and have a sense of humor, go for it.  Buy it.\n\nTake a potato.

Deep combat, huge amount of RPG goodness like classes, crafting, customization, skills, discovery, exploration, and a deep narrative. So much to do. So much love in this game and the DOS-like interface is hardly noticeable. The game is very, very immersive and you grow attached to you characters. The game is deceptiely deep.. literally not one dull moment.\n\nThere is a lot of content in the game. A full playthrough could easily go 10-15 hours.\n\nTherein lies the crappy part - this game is a 1-death permadeath roguelike. Some enemies are very very strong and sort of \"come out of nowhere\"  and two-shot you (often after a wave of trivial fights). Your characters die rather... unceremoniously... and you get nothing from their deaths.  It's not like other roguelikes where the game is short enough to where it's alright, or you have sort of an \"HQ\" through which dying at least allowed some sort of gain... you start from square one. \n\nThere is a \"softcore\" mode... but each death in this mode reduces global item drop rates. That just isn't fun. So much of the game is collecting items and managing them... not an inspiring or fun way to play the game. I don't count that as a decent softcore mode - each time you die the game becomes less fun and more tedious.\n\nEDIT: I WAS WRONG ABOUT SOFTCORE MODE! Each death DOES NOT drop global drop rates. Rather, global drop rates are dropped just once.. at the beginning of the game. Not as harsh. THAT SAID - the reduced item drop rate still is a \"punishment\" mechanic for choosing an easier difficulty. Further, softcore mode just feels... lame. You die and instantly come back and can enter that exact same fight with a single keypress. In other RPGs with a save system, you at least have to \"go through the dungeon\" or something similar. There are some stakes on the line for dying - you'll have to climb to the top of the mountain, or whatever. Softcore mode removes the stakes entirely. The game has two extremes - a completely inappropriate die-and-restart-the-entire-15-hour-game, or absolute-0-consequence-for-dying. Neither are compelling to me as a player. Game would be perfect with a Final Fantasy style in-between.\n\nAlso, I know people say \"yeah, hard perma-death... that's the fun! that's the point\". But I don't know. It doesn't feel right for this game. It's so deep... there is so much joy just from the RPG elements. The game replays every narrative scene on playthroughs.... you slowly unlock gameplay elements EACH playthrough... it's like the game wasn't MEANT to be a roguelike. You end up banging the spacebar through story sequences you've already seen. You end up saltily unlocking skills and gameplay elements that you already have intimate knowledge of (\"You've unlocked crafting - here's hw you craft\" after having been a craftmaster last playthrough). I feel like the developer jumped on the roguelike train on a game that didn't need to be a roguelike.\n\nThe result of the harsh roguelike set-up with a simply ANNOYING and UN-FUN result is that you grind grind grind to make sure you don't die to an encounter that catches you off-guard. You make your character OP. Still, you may die to a surprise insanely powerful enemy... but maybe not.\n\nAll this bad stuff said - the game is great fun. Well worth 5 dollars. ESPECIALLY if you like challenging rogue-likes and are slightly masochistic... GET THIS GAME. If you just want a great RPG... maybe look elsewhere. This game will frustrate you for being a great RPG that deletes your save when you die.\n\n3/5 (5/5 if not a rogue-like)", "timestamp_created": 1424054190, "timestamp_updated": 1429845686, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 299, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.854587", "comment_count": "17", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14491583": {"recommendationid": "14491583", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066245546", "num_games_owned": 223, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 259, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481477468}, "language": "german", "review": "This is just F*cking Awsome - it feels like booooom baaaaaem something like a Potato hit you in the Face...oh wait sure this was happening in the Game just want to entertain some guests in the Tavern but stripping was to bad an then i got hit with a potator....and don't eat the cat in the tree ^-^\n\nReally fun RPG its Hard not to die but its a lot fun to do it alllllll again when it happens \n_________________________________________\nDas Spiel ist einfach mega Lustig wer auf abgedrehte RPG steht sollte sich es unbedingt zu legen, zwar geht es sehr viel um Katoffeln (Waffen, Gott \u00e4hnliche verherrlichung, Wurfgeschosse f\u00fcr schlechte Darbietung etc) aber es macht es einfach Lustig allein bei den Events die auswahl m\u00f6glichkeiten wie (Essen, treten, streichlen, drauf Pinkeln) sorgt f\u00fcr viele Lacher....aber vorsicht das Spiel ist schon relertiv Schwer wenn man pech hat Stirbt man im Classic mode (sofortiger Wipe keine Save Games) beim ersten Mop. ^-^\n\nF\u00fcr alle liebhaber verr\u00fcckter dinge ein Muss!", "timestamp_created": 1424046748, "timestamp_updated": 1424046748, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496380", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14490950": {"recommendationid": "14490950", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023685521", "num_games_owned": 201, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 2496, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 286, "last_played": 1513915484}, "language": "english", "review": "Good music, good gameplay, great art.

I didn't even know ASCII was a thing until I started getting into roguelikes in my teens, and even then, I had to use tilesets for games like Rogue and Nethack just to comprehend what I was seeing. Some games, like Dwarf Fortress, have remained arcane to me even after hours of video tutorials. In short, ASCII graphics were something I either liked games [i]in spite[/i] of, or an obstacle that prevented me from enjoying games I'd otherwise like.\n\nDays ago I'd have laughed in your face for suggesting I'd be charmed by this graphical style one day... Particularly because years of struggling with it had made me bitter. It had become a sign of desperation to me in modern indie games; the last bastion for a dev team short on artistic talent. I saw it as an easy out. A flaw. A design choice always made when the pressures of time, money, or ambition precluded other, better graphical styles.\n\n[b]And then I played SanctuaryRPG... And my world changed.[/b]\n\nSanctuaryRPG: Black Edition is a turn-based tactical RPG with, as you've probably guessed, ASCII graphics. Naturally this means that most screens in the game are represented by text, (usually white) on a black background. It's my opinion that this is innately annoying to look at for hours at a time, but SanctuaryRPG have made several smart design decisions that make it tolerable, (at the very least) even to the harshest detractors of text-based graphics. \n\nFor one thing, ASCII games are notorious for often being visually cluttered. In some genres, like grand strategy, this is practically unavoidable. But SanctuaryRPG, being predominantly a turn-based, menu-heavy RPG, includes a great deal of negative space in every screen. Even better, most of the time the positive space is taken up by nothing more than competent, charming, and not at all visually taxing ASCII illustrations that vary in colour, plus the omnipresent menus beneath them.\n\nObviously if you're not a fan of turn-based RPGs the menus can be a turn off, but as someone with a bit of experience in the genre I can say with confidence that SanctuaryRPG's menus are quite easy to understand and navigate. And when they're not, you can type a question mark in most screens of the game for some clarification. Also, and this is kind of a weird observation, the devs take a great deal of care in not forcing you to remember your character's details. Usually if you can take an action that draws on your character's traits, the game will inform you of the relevant trait in parentheses at the end of the option you can select to perform that action. You'll rarely have to look at your character sheet in-depth, making gameplay much more kinetic and less prep-heavy than it otherwise would be.\n\nNow, I know I've gone on about the graphical style of the game quite a bit... But if I do, it's only because I know how skeptical I was before purchasing - and I want to bully other skeptics into doing the same. Because underneath its divisive ASCII exterior lies a truly fun and fulfilling RPG. It doesn't just set up the main quest and inexolerably push you toward its conclusion; it gives you [i]options[/i]. You can engage in random events, fight in an arena, dig for minerals, craft equipment, fight sets of procedurally-generated enemies, do sidequests, join factions, have awkward conversations with NPCs, run a bar, improve your camp, read books, be followed home by a potato, and more! And some of the minigames associated with these activities are surprisingly robust. \n\nUnfortunately, this wouldn't be a review without outlining some things I take issue with in the game; thankfully none of them are too bad. For one, even after the tutorial I found conducting combat a little confusing. Some of the less traditional RPG battle concepts, like moveset swapping, knowing when to heal and when to finish a combo, fully understading your meters, and the *HUGE* list of enemy traits are hard to get down at first, and the subtleties kind of have to be arrived at through trial and error. Also, there are no combat animations or anything, so tossing a fireball as a mage is about as visually interesting as swinging a sword; which is to say, not. Thankfully the classes are differentiated greatly by their traits, so it's still very worthwhile to try on different hats... Not that you'll have much of a choice playing in classic mode, because you're almost certainly going to die, and will NOT want to level that barbarian up to 20 again.\n\nSo, in closing, I would say that SanctuaryRPG is not only a great game, but the only one to ever cure me, (if only temporarily) of my bias against ASCII graphics. If that's your last sticking point when it comes to buying this game, at [i]least[/i] try the demo, (available on the developer's site) and see if you enjoy the gameplay. If you typically enjoy challenging turn-based RPGs with a great deal of content outside of the main storyline, this may just be the game for you. If you like all that and don't mind harsh penalties for character death, this is almost certainly the game for you. But don't take my word for it; research! Do enough digging and you'll find the lovely, impassioned devs behind it all, who clearly believe in their product and have infused it with quality to match. And if that isn't the best argument for taking a chance on this game, I don't know what is!\n\nOh, and did I mention that the game is chock-full of oddball humour? Didn't feel right to list it with the pros or the cons since it's such a subjective thing. I like it, though. :)\n", "timestamp_created": 1424038981, "timestamp_updated": 1424038981, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14489513": {"recommendationid": "14489513", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987487877", "num_games_owned": 336, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4426, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487232344}, "language": "english", "review": "\"Better than I thought it would be\" - Sagat", "timestamp_created": 1424037042, "timestamp_updated": 1424037182, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14487671": {"recommendationid": "14487671", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001003198", "num_games_owned": 193, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 493, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1425259887}, "language": "english", "review": "this game makes me spooge big loads", "timestamp_created": 1424029934, "timestamp_updated": 1424029934, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499574", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14486975": {"recommendationid": "14486975", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038380140", "num_games_owned": 219, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 687, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486815160}, "language": "german", "review": "Einfach nur geil :D", "timestamp_created": 1424027122, "timestamp_updated": 1424027122, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14485676": {"recommendationid": "14485676", "author": {"steamid": "76561198103518030", "num_games_owned": 56, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3380, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468922686}, "language": "english", "review": "Beat myself in the groin with a sack of potatoes. \n10/10 would ign again", "timestamp_created": 1424022842, "timestamp_updated": 1424022842, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14481774": {"recommendationid": "14481774", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042145047", "num_games_owned": 607, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 579, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1425048652}, "language": "english", "review": "Pros:\n- Very nice fighting system: you can't just spam your preferred skill until the enemy is dead, but you have to actively respond to his attacks and pay attention to his bonus stats.\n- Has a lot of humour in it.

This game is not so great if you don't have a full keyboard and numpad.\n\nFirst, let me say that I absolutely LOVE SanctuaryRPG, and it's Black release is just wonderful. The project started out free (as in beer) and has since moved to a paid (Black) version.\n\nThe actual navigation of the game is basically non-existent. You have locations that you can choose to enter, but there is no \"map\" to speak of. The combat is interesting enough, but the real fun is in all of the randomness and volume of options. Everything is a die-roll in the background. Enter a location, die-roll determines the event / baddie. Kill a baddie, die-roll determines the loot. Perform crafting, die-roll determines the actual item. And on, and on, and on.\n\nAnd all along the way, you're presented with options that change your experience. Agree with this pamphlet you just found? Your alignment just changed slightly. Solved this puzzle? Here's a sidequest that might kills you. Killed a boss? Here's a subtle customization option. I've been playing SRPG for about 3 months now (free then Black), and I've only used one class. There's a HUGE amount of gameplay variation available.\n\nThe graphics are actually very well thought out, and there is tongue-in-cheek commentary to be found in the ASCII art. You won't get a chill from seeing moonlight glinting off the water as the breeze blows through shoots of grass, but the graphical approach works well to pull off a consistent aesthetic and feel.\n\nNow here's the caveat: you really should play with a full keyboard plus numpad. The experience is clearly tailored for a left hand on A-S-D-F and a right hand on the numpad. With this setup, the game plays smooth and the design works. If you play with a laptop, though, the fun diminishes somewhat, and if you try a touchscreen keyboard, the fun disappears.", "timestamp_created": 1423941624, "timestamp_updated": 1423941624, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14463938": {"recommendationid": "14463938", "author": {"steamid": "76561197968592122", "num_games_owned": 3673, "num_reviews": 67, "playtime_forever": 453, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1424959054}, "language": "english", "review": "Carrot meet Stick, Skinner meet Box, yup it's one of those games, a loot game.\n\nThis game is just fantastic, nothing quite like it on Steam so your definitely in for a unique experience here.\n\nI've been playing since early beta and it's been strangely addictive, it must be the skinner box thing.

It's got humor, fun combat, REALLY fun character building and extremely replayable.\n\n2/2 would buy again", "timestamp_created": 1423846024, "timestamp_updated": 1423846024, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "14442719": {"recommendationid": "14442719", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057494288", "num_games_owned": 1049, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 267, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1432115471}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u30fe(\uff61\uff40\u0414\u00b4\uff61)\u592aTama\u597d\u73a9\u5566\uff01\n\u590d\u53e4roguelike\u4f2a\u53a8\u5927\u6ee1\u8db3\uff01\n\u88ab\u5c0f\u602a\u521d\u89c1\u4e00\u51fb\u5fc5\u6740\u7b80\u76f4\u6d51\u8eab\u6b22\u559c\uff01\n\u4e0d\u6d6a\u600e\u4e48\u73a9roguelike\uff01\n\uff08\u81f3\u4eca\u6ca1\u4e00\u4e2a\u89d2\u8272\u6d3b\u8fc71\u5c0f\u65f6\u5374\u4f9d\u7136\u5728\u575a\u6301classic\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u8822\u8d27\u5982\u662f\u8bf4\uff09\n\n8bit\u97f3\u4e50\u592a\u60a6\u8033\uff01\u9ebb\u75f9\u6211\u8981\u4e70OST\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1423808407, "timestamp_updated": 1423808407, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.632494", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "14439808": {"recommendationid": "14439808", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058762606", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2417, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1458774379}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10 would grapple again", "timestamp_created": 1423788472, "timestamp_updated": 1423788472, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.470175", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "14430040": {"recommendationid": "14430040", "author": {"steamid": "76561198115225861", "num_games_owned": 223, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 403, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1442520755}, "language": "english", "review": "Combining a quirky sense of humor and ancient game mechanics, it's a fantastic title if it's your cup of tea. \nYou're going to read\nYou're going to slam buttons to get through things when you get impatient\nYou're going to laugh at jokes about milking things\n", "timestamp_created": 1423640646, "timestamp_updated": 1423640646, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "14415013": {"recommendationid": "14415013", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970632671", "num_games_owned": 300, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 394, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1448720506}, "language": "english", "review": "If you play rouguelikes, then buy this. You will not be dissapointed. Don't let the graphics or mention of ascii fool you. I love rouguelikes, but am not a fan of '@' games. This is not an \"@\" game. This is more of a text based adventure(kind of similar to the ios game \"A Dark Room\") where you find yourself asking questions about pototoes and urine, and getting your exposed crotch smashed by a skeleton's axe.\n\nPros:\n-Gameplay is simple, yet complex. You can spend you time in the mines digging ore to craft weapons, or maybe spend some time in your tavern serving beers hoping to get tipped good items. You can go fight monsters in multiple places, or follow the \"main\" quest. There doesn't seem to be any limit on how much you can level up an any area, so knock yourself out.\n-Items. The weapons are random and endless. There are like five types of weapons, and I have never seen any duplicates. They all have random modifiers, and there are many variations of the weapon types.\n-Funny. Everything in this game is hilarious. I love dying so I can start a new charactor and laugh my ass off reading their bio. I never thought I would laugh so hard at a text based adventure, but I did, and still do.\n-Music. The music is awesome. It's like old 8bit video game but modern and catchy. Sound effects are present as well and are also very well done.\n-Combat. It's so easy you'll die continuously. Just use the numpad, and pay attention to the combat modifiers.\n\nCons:\nI litterally cannot think of anything that I don't like about this game. This isn't a steam sale game. You will actually play this, so just buy it right now and shutup.\n", "timestamp_created": 1423563138, "timestamp_updated": 1423563138, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.534524", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "14410999": {"recommendationid": "14410999", "author": {"steamid": "76561197977127768", "num_games_owned": 299, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3316, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1436463527}, "language": "english", "review": "32 hours in and only finished the first chapter. \nSo many good references.\nDeep yet quick and painless.\nBetter than diablo 3.\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1423532151, "timestamp_updated": 1423532183, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512549", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "14406025": {"recommendationid": "14406025", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993930568", "num_games_owned": 4459, "num_reviews": 350, "playtime_forever": 32, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1424528191}, "language": "english", "review": "The only fully ASCII game on steam and it has chiptune music and great chunky synth sound effects.", "timestamp_created": 1423506801, "timestamp_updated": 1423506801, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504074", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "14398390": {"recommendationid": "14398390", "author": {"steamid": "76561198130415895", "num_games_owned": 756, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 949, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490236963}, "language": "english", "review": "I was unsure about this game. I've never really played any ascii type games, except when I was too young to remember them, but I thought I'd give this one a go based on all the positive things people have said about this game, and I am 100% glad that I did!\n\nFirst of all, there is so much to do, so many little quests, bounties and even the management of the tavern if you play your cards right. All of the random encounters, hilarious and often nonsensical slices of humour thrown in here and there really make this game feel so much fun. You'll find dialogue such as \"A potato has decided to follow you around.\" to something terrifying funny like \"The worm defecates in your ear.\" \n\nThe ascii art work is very polished and looks as though it has had a lot of love put into it. It's charming and simple.\n\nThe gameplay, from character creation to the immense replayability and even the combat system, reminds me of one of my favourite games of all time: Tales of Maj Eyal, it has that similar feel of even if you lose, you just want to start over and try again immediately, which is an essential element to the rogue-like genre. Starting over in this game doesn't feel like a chore, because it's different each time and every character you play. There is so much loot which really is part of the glue that holds everything together, making every run through a unique and challenging experience.\n\nThe combat system is very intuitive and unique. There are a whole bunch of different skills and combos which makes the combat a real edge of your seat sort of affair, but if you play your cards right, and you take your time and are meticulous with your decisions, it will leave you feeling incredibly satisfied after a challenging fight.\n\nOverall, I have yet to discover anything negative about this game, I love every feature and every bit of text is a delight to read. For an ascii game, it is more engaging than a lot of the games in my library, I recommend it 100%!\n\nAlso, do not be fooled by the early access sticker, because this game is very polished and clearly a very loved project by the incredibly talented developers.

The ASCII art in this game is incredible for what it's medium is. Even the animation is awesome. The ability to accurately convey the art of the genre and actually be enthralling and interesting is amazing. \n\nSound: 10/10\nEasily my favorite part about this game is the chiptune soundtrack. The music is plentiful and mixed. The sound effects are perfectly adapted and timed. There are so many rich and warm tunes it immerses you right into the game like you wouldn't believe. I hope they release the soundtrack for this game on Steam too.\n\nOverall: 7/10\nIt might not be everyones cup of tea but to anyone that loves text adventures this is a must-have.

But for what it is, I think it does well. The ASCII art is actually rather endearing and as you put more time into it, you'll begin to look forward to getting a certain item popup, or dreading meeting a really powerful enemy as your character's life is on the line every time.\n\nThe music matches the style, \"retro\" but in all the best ways. There were very few songs I disliked.\nThe humor can be hit or miss but there's a lot of little references to popular media that I think many will appreciate.\n\nCombat while it has a simple interface, can become rather interesting as you level. You MUST pay attention to on screen cues or you will get punished in the worst way. It isn't a game that you can just idle the same buttons, at least until you are sufficiently strong.\n\nThe first area won't be that exciting, but if you make it to the second area, you'll meet a lot more npcs which will also help you level, unlock more powerful abilities, and so on. It can actually become a bit too much if you try and manage your time between adventuring, going on npc fetch quests, messing around in the colosseum, making armor, serving drinks, etc.\n\nWarning though, if you are a \"fair player\", stay away from using auto combat. Certain combinations of negative statuses on your character can confuse your CPU self making it make bad decisions (continously trying to heal or reposition when it cannot instead of breaking free from a snare) which leads to your character's demise. This may be adjusted in the future as this is an early access game, but at time of writing, this warning is accurate.\n\nI ended up playing the game outright, so I never played the demo, but I figure it is still a good representation of the game.

The retro aesthetic blended with a good mixture action and humor is perfect for the old school and modern gamers alike. Sanctuary RPG comes highly recommended from me and I think the game deserved to be nominated!\n\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n- EVENT -\n\n * You see a hobo standing near a tree.\n\n - Say hello to the hobo.\n\n * The hobo stabs you and run away.\n\nHP : 1 / 12469\n\n__________________________\n\nFinally, after 18 hours and 3 characters, I've finally defeated the Matron using my level 90 Barbarian in Classic mode. I must say, it truly is satisfying!\n\nThis game... Wow, how can I put it into words. Honestly, when I first received this game, I was a bit unsure of what to expect. i didn't even know what ASCII means (guess I'm not old enough to be acquainted with the genre). For a guy with over 500 games in his library, I keep coming back to this one every now and then.\n\nSanctuaryRPG is simply put a text-based roguelike loot-centric driven RPG. Featuring harsh permadeaths and surprisingly amount of depth in equipments, abilities and characters, this game is definitely a hidden gem to come out recently! The gameplay mostly requires you to read, enter commands, such as 1, 2, 3, A, S, and read some more. Don't be discourage though, because the developers and writers are definitely a funny bunch! Also, they seem to have an insanely amount of love to potatoes (they should probably get some help about it). Aside from the main story line, there's also dungeon exploration, matchmaking (not really online but with ranks and it decreases over time), fun little tavern management, crafting (never leave home without it!) and a Lunatic mode for those looking for a bigger challenge!\n\nIf you're still worried about the game's playtime duration, don't. Why? Aside from the numerous characters and backgrounds you can choose, the level cap is set (currently) at 300 and the trials (achievments) are insane, requiring to get the highest rank in Matchmaking, encountering 500 random events in the map, etc. Also, it's worth noting that the devs are actively updating the game, adding and fixing in the average once per week. The devs are also very friendly! You can approach them for any enquiries if you want. That's pretty rare these days, no?\n\nI'll probably update this review in the future in case a significant update comes up and I need to put this out. It's been a blast for me to play this and I hope to continue enjoying this masterpiece of an indie game.\n\n\nPersonally, I give SanctuaryRPG a solid 9 / 10!

Malgr\u00e9 son aspect simpliste, le jeu est tactique, et les m\u00e9canismes de jeu sont bien pens\u00e9s. Deux modes de jeu sont disponibles au d\u00e9part : Classic, avec permadeath pour une exp\u00e9rience Rogue-like ; et Softcore, pour une aventure plus d\u00e9tendue, avec une p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 en cas de mort mais pas la perte de votre personnage.\n\n[u]Les points positifs vs. points n\u00e9gatifs du jeu :[/u]\n+ Humour omnipr\u00e9sent, sans \u00eatre lourd\n+ M\u00e9canismes de jeu intuitifs\n+ Une certaine simplicit\u00e9 qui ne rend pas le jeu facile ou inint\u00e9ressant pour autant\n+ Bonne OST, et qui colle bien avec le jeu\n+ Syst\u00e8me de combat au tour par tour simple mais r\u00e9ellement tactique\n+ Elements RPG r\u00e9ussis\n+ Exploration agr\u00e9able, motiv\u00e9e par la recherche de loot, les \u00e9v\u00e8nements al\u00e9atoires, et la soif de d\u00e9couvertes\n+ C\u00f4t\u00e9 old-school r\u00e9ussi\n+ Beaucoup de contenu, un grand nombre de classes, divers armes et autres \u00e9quipements\n+ Un jeu original, \u00e7a change !\n+ Jeu addictif !\n+/- Graphismes ASCII qui ne plairont peut-\u00eatre pas \u00e0 tout le monde (mais auxquels on s'habitue, et qui font vraiment le charme du jeu)\n+/- Les influences Rogue-like risquent de ne pas plaire \u00e0 ceux qui veulent la facilit\u00e9\n+/- Jeu exclusivement en Anglais (je suppose que c'est un moins pour certains)\n\nSanctuaryRPG: Black Edition est un tr\u00e8s bon jeu, simple mais addictif, original, et dans lequel simplicit\u00e9 ne veut pas dire facilit\u00e9.

I love rouge-likes. AND AT FIRST\n\nI WAS HORRIFIED at what i was seeing and doing in this game. The charm immediatly appealed to me,  but the game play itself seemed incredibly lack-luster. To the point of \"what am i even doing here?\"\n\n\nThat was until I leveled up a few times, and had about thirty or so encounters and suddenly, i was finding myself entertained. Im not sure when it happend. probably as i learned what all the combat indicators where atually telling me to do, and now im afraid this game has achieved candy crush level of addictiveness for me. And it all has to do with the rouge like nature of the item drops and encounters. Watching the little animation play as you know its generating up a item is fun, and feels like gambling in a bizzare way. \n\nThis is a game that opens so incredibly narrow in its presentation i almost rage quited to uninstall- having assumed i made a terrible mistake. But thank god i didnt, or i would be missing out. \n\nFighting,Mining, crafting, tavern running- its all as interactive as a few button presses. But my god! do the button presses feel good! (Once you know how mighty striking that 4 key truely is)\n\nThe music? spot on. Ive left the game minimized just to enjoy it while i did some other things not involving pressing numericals. \n\nThe battles? Once you know what you are doing, are fun and can be extremely challenging\n\nLeveling is intuitive and not too bogged down with fluff (INT, STR, DEX ect. do as you would assume) \n\ntalking to freindly NPC's are only worth the quirky lines and the occasional reward for even bothering. otherwise, interactions could use some work (looping dialogs) \n\nPacing is difficult, as you would expect from a rouge like. \n\n~I KNOW I HAVE NOT SEEN ALL THIS TITLE HAS TO OFFER~ i just feel it. \n\nSO, to summarize, this is a wonderful little peice of classic gaming. Not for everyone, but certainly for me.

Con eliminado me refiero a que en la normal el guardi\u00e1n ten\u00eda tres modos y uno de ellos te daban un +20% m\u00e1s de vida con los turnos que iban pasando, algo que cambia en la Black Edition; lo cual es comprensible porque de tener mil de vida uno terminaba teniendo tres millones y hac\u00eda el juego m\u00e1s f\u00e1cil. En la Black Edition se han a\u00f1adido m\u00e1s cosas, ya sea m\u00e1s habilidades por parte de los enemigos como zonas a donde ir beneficiosas para nuestro personaje. Dichas zonas ser\u00edan la biblioteca o el templo, otras se mantienen como el herrero o la taberna.\nOtros a\u00f1adidos son nuevos or\u00edgenes (muchos de ellos desbloqueables al progresar en la historia), nuevas habilidades por obtener y objetos muuuuuy extra\u00f1os de conseguir para el personaje. Tambi\u00e9n se ha agregado la posibilidad de elegir un bando u otro, hermandad o resistencia, o simplemente ser neutral; algo que ir\u00e1 cambiando conforme vayas encontr\u00e1ndose panfletos por ah\u00ed y elijas una opci\u00f3n u otra.\nPor hablar de m\u00e1s diferencias se podr\u00eda a\u00f1adir que algunas \u00abim\u00e1genes\u00bb de algunos enemigos han sido cambiadas y se han a\u00f1adido m\u00e1s dibujos para lo que antes no hab\u00eda m\u00e1s que texto. Por ejemplo vemos el acto 4, donde en la edici\u00f3n normal lo pas\u00e9 dos veces y es el acto que menos me gust\u00f3 porque se me hizo pesado, en cambio en la Black Edition eso no me ha ocurrido. Se ha a\u00f1adido m\u00e1s texto, el que haya d\u00eda y noche (antes no hab\u00eda) hace la diferencia para m\u00ed ya que prefiero usar la noche para ir a la biblioteca a leer y dem\u00e1s. Es decir, el acto 4 se me ha hecho m\u00e1s ameno en esta edici\u00f3n entre una cosa y otra.\nM\u00e1s o menos dir\u00eda que son las desemejanzas que he ido viendo, para los que no hay\u00e1is jugado a la anterior es mejor que salt\u00e9is hasta aqu\u00ed:\n\nEl juego es todo texto y meter teclas para hacer una acci\u00f3n u otra, no hay gr\u00e1ficos per se, lo que hay son dibujos en ASCII. Para atacar basta con usar teclas como 1, 2, 3, Q, R y un par m\u00e1s. Para curarse uno hace el uso del 4. El juego es por turnos y en esencia es bastante sencillo lo que viene ser el atacar o desplazarse.\nHay varios personajes, est\u00e1 el asesino (yo personalmente uso este), el arquero, el b\u00e1rbaro, el palad\u00edn, el mago y el druida. Todos ellos personalizables, puedes elegir su origen para recibir beneficios adem\u00e1s de su g\u00e9nero, complexi\u00f3n (el cual tambi\u00e9n da un beneficio u otro) y unos cuantos dise\u00f1os para la cara y pelo. No vas a verle mucho la cara a tu personaje, as\u00ed que en realidad da igual. Cada personaje dependiendo de su clase ser\u00e1 favorecido de una forma u otra (al asesino no le conviene usar armadura pesada, por ejemplo, pero s\u00ed se beneficia bien de la destreza), pero como en cualquier juego, los comandos para cada ataque son los mismos, las teclas 1, 2 y 3 las vas a tocar en cualquier personaje.\nEl nivel m\u00e1ximo es 300, as\u00ed que hay para rato, y m\u00e1s si uno juega en modo cl\u00e1sico de lo cual hablar\u00e9 ahora:\n\nEl juego tiene modo cl\u00e1sico y softcore. El cl\u00e1sico es el \u00abt\u00edpico\u00bb, de ah\u00ed que el juego sea un rogue-like, si tu personaje muere, desp\u00eddete de \u00e9l y empieza de nuevo. Quien haya jugado a Akalabeth, Realm of the Mad God o incluso a los libros juego de Lobo Solitario sabr\u00e1 de qu\u00e9 va el tema.\nEn cambio en softcore uno puede morir, tiene sus desventajas como tener menos posibilidad de drops pero es m\u00e1s seguro. Al morir la \u00fanica penalizaci\u00f3n que se tiene es perder la experiencia obtenida en ese nivel y todo el dinero.\n\nEn cuanto a la historia del juego... consta de cinco actos, cada uno de ellos con varias zonas por las que avanzar y con enemigos por derrotar. De vez en cuando se puede encontrar a personajes que solamente soltar\u00e1n alguna frase o puede que regalen algo, otras veces se ven panfletos, tambi\u00e9n te puedes topar con eventos en los que puedes conseguir armaduras o armas; y tambi\u00e9n hay veces que se pueden explorar zonas extra si se da la opci\u00f3n.\nVolviendo a la historia me record\u00f3 un poco a la saga de libros de Los proscritos y los desterrados, me daba la sensaci\u00f3n de estar viviendo esos libros. En principio puede ser un poco confuso, \u00bfqui\u00e9nes son los \u00abbuenos\u00bb? \u00bfqui\u00e9nes son los \u00abmalos\u00bb? Depende de cada uno la elecci\u00f3n mientras vaya avanzando. Poco a poco tambi\u00e9n sabremos m\u00e1s sobre la gente que nos acompa\u00f1a. Pero no queda ah\u00ed, el juego cuenta con referencias y bromas (como el que se da en los or\u00edgenes de cada personaje), lo cual depende de cada uno que las capte o no y su humor.\nEl juego es lineal en cuanto a historia, s\u00ed, pero los eventos que suceden en el juego son aleatorios.\n\nYa habl\u00e9 de \u00abzonas beneficiosas para nosotros\u00bb, \u00bfverdad? Esos sitios son el herrero y m\u00e1s. \nB\u00e1sicamente es lo mismo que en cualquier juego: el herrero es para conseguir armas, la mercader para conseguir otros objetos, la biblioteca para leer y ganar m\u00e1s experiencia, el coliseo para pelear contra enemigos y subir de rango y nivel, etc\u00e9tera.\nEl juego dispone de un sistema de crafteo, donde uno puede crear sus propias armaduras, armas y escudos, y no est\u00e1 dejado al azar, uno tiene que ir viendo si le conviene usar una acci\u00f3n u otra aunque pueda llegar a romper el objeto que se est\u00e1 creando en cuesti\u00f3n, o bien ir demasiado tranquilo y ser de muy baja calidad.\n\nPor \u00faltimo queda hablar del idioma, la dificultad, la ost y su duraci\u00f3n:\nEl juego est\u00e1 en ingl\u00e9s, solamente es texto as\u00ed que no hay voces; pero es en ingl\u00e9s al menos de momento. Se puede jugar perfectamente sin conocer el idioma pero l\u00f3gicamente se pierde la historia de juego.\n\u00bfLa OST? A m\u00ed me gusta y el ambiente que da tambi\u00e9n, encaja con el juego y no es de las que se hacen pesadas. A quien le guste mucho mucho siempre puede comprarla.\nY la duraci\u00f3n, bueno, depende. En la versi\u00f3n normal tengo cerca de treinta horas y me lo pas\u00e9 dos veces en softcore. En la Black Edition cuento con catorce horas en el momento en el que estoy escribiendo este an\u00e1lisis, pero mi partida en el modo cl\u00e1sico es de unas 7-8 horas con mi segundo asesino (el primero muri\u00f3 al llevar 1-2h de juego). El resto son unas cuantas en softcore y alg\u00fan personaje salteado para probar en cl\u00e1sico. Con lo que el juego en s\u00ed si se quiere pasar una vez y en softcore se hace r\u00e1pido, pero si es en el modo cl\u00e1sico se puede tardar m\u00e1s si no se conocen las mec\u00e1nicas. Y m\u00e1s si se quiere llegar al nivel m\u00e1ximo, que como dije es 300.\n\u00bfF\u00e1cil o dif\u00edcil? Bueno, la mec\u00e1nica del juego es f\u00e1cil, llegar hasta el final en la primera partida y en el modo cl\u00e1sico no tanto. Los enemigos cuentan con varios estados y habilidades, unos te envenar\u00e1n, te provocar\u00e1n sangrado, se sanar\u00e1n, te dejar\u00e1n sin man\u00e1 entre otras. Y si uno no es precavido, no conoce todav\u00eda c\u00f3mo funciona cada cosa o incluso tiene mala suerte, pues puede morir por un m\u00edsero slime. Y claro, morir en modo cl\u00e1sico y m\u00e1s si es cerca del final, duele. Yo recomiendo que para quienes no hayan jugado al juego lo suyo es que se lo pasen al menos una vez en softcore y ya luego pasar al cl\u00e1sico. Gracias a que me pas\u00e9 la antigua versi\u00f3n dos veces en softcore no he tenido problemas en el modo cl\u00e1sico en \u00e9sta. En mi segunda partida he podido llegar al final sin problemas, as\u00ed que como dije, que sea dif\u00edcil o no depende de lo familiarizado que est\u00e9 uno y el modo de juego.\n\n\u00bfQue si recomiendo este juego? Si te gustan los juegos por turnos, no te importa tener que empezar de nuevo si mueres y no te molesta el hecho de que sea en texto, al contrario, te llama la atenci\u00f3n, s\u00ed, deber\u00edas probarlo.\n", "timestamp_created": 1420760957, "timestamp_updated": 1420760957, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.619400", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "13900511": {"recommendationid": "13900511", "author": {"steamid": "76561198121678187", "num_games_owned": 284, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 81, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1421166783}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1] Graphics: [/h1] 10/10.

In addition to that you have a crafting system which consist of hitting materials in one of 3 manners, waiting or by crafman skill level based abilities, in order to get the highest numbers, pretty much like any other Rpg. You also have some NPCs to interact with, doing quests, talking, buying or selling stuff, once more the usual things for a Rpg. You spend your time on teh fields for the formerly killing of various entinities, your camp (for crafting), the tavern earning money and questing, the arena killing people and random dungeons, or even the library (mainly you just get bored or get dizzy from the reading) other thatn that a temple. What you can do at the different places should be obvious, one important thing to mention in addition to the, currently, four difiiculty levels to pick from when starting the game, you can adjust the strength of enemies at the temple, in the version at the time of the review, it could change, as it used to be the arena back in the itch.io days.  \n\nBased on the \"review\" up to now you might wonder \"Well if it is just a simplistic game, which is kinda artsy by using a graphics style from over 20 years ago, why would I buy it?\" and, lucky you, there actually is a reason: the humour (though you might want to take that with a pinch of salt, after all us germans are known for not having a good sense for it).\nStill from my point of view it is quite good, even though it does include a fair share of overused jokes, toilet humour and puns, it still manages to entertain me with it.\n\nI also should add that I spend most of my time with the game prior to its release on steam, when it was only out on itch.io, so I can't tell you a whole lot about the additions of the black edition, I can still tell you about my experience with how fast game crashing or breakings bugs are dealt with, as the game is currently still in early access.\nDuring the 7 hours of playing the steam version 1.00 to 1.04 I encountered one game crash which included save corruption (immoratilty, instakilling every opponent, item drops crashing the game) and while that is the only bug and crash I ever encountered I should also mention that I also have encountered this one in the non-steam version.\nIn that case around 10 times in at least 50hours+, sadly I could never figure out what caused it in order to avoid it.\nOtherwise bugs are pretty rare, though some patches cause new ones, the last one caused by a patch was fixed with a new patch the very next day.\n\nOverall I can easily recommend the game in its current state for the price point of 5\u20ac.", "timestamp_created": 1420623916, "timestamp_updated": 1420623980, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "13875257": {"recommendationid": "13875257", "author": {"steamid": "76561197980795527", "num_games_owned": 255, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 3235, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478482621}, "language": "english", "review": "I got ahold of this while it was still going through the Greenlight process during beta, and it's only gotten better and better.

To those people I recomend the game.\n\nNow let me tell you about my 1st game... rather how it ended.\n\n\n\nSo I went to my tavern. There was a few dozen people there and I decided to serve them all. Half way through I drink a bunch of beers to give me some energy to enterain my patrons. I drank a ton of beer and got drunk. Serving all the remaining I closed up for the night. Then I went off in the woods and found a hidden path! What lie was a human BOSS level dude with about 10 times my HP.\n\nThat was okay. I am used to seeing really beefy enemies. I had a charm that was pretty epic: when I took damage the amount I took was reflected back to the traget. Every time. That was actually my 1st item I crafted and must have gotten super lucky! So even if I just healed myself every turn and took some damage I could basically kill anything.\n\nWell... being drunk blocks your command section, I found out. I was doing GREAT till the boss rooted/ entangled me. I didn't notice it and took a few turns healing. But because I was trapped I could not use my heal. I didn't notice it right away because my command section was blocked off. On the last round before I died I was like Ohhhhh I think I am rooted! So I broke free. Then was killed.\n\nI played as a ice-person race paladin and made it to level 24 in my 4 hour game. Oddly enough I am not really upset! I had such a great time that story (ie character). Yes loosing did suck but loosing can indeed be fun too!\n\nThere is a FREE version of the game that is a bit older without some of the newer features and such. So you can try it yourself and get an idea of how the game plays to see if you like it. But its only $4.99 USD right now in early access. And I must say the early access feels like a finished game now. If I had not known it was an early release I would never have guessed it.\n\nTons of replay value. Tons of possible random events. Tons of enemies and items. No two battles or items will be identical! But I can see how playing it for 100 hours would be repetitive for some people. Its easy to play and the combat is actually pretty complex under-the-hood. There are some actual tactics to be had in how this turn base ascii game runs! I am very pleased with this game. And in all truth when I died after the inital \"Noooooo awwwww D: \" passed I felt like clapping! Seriously was that fun to me!\n\nIf you are an old school gamer and have five dollars to spare then please consider supporting/ owning Santuary RPG.

Not too little, and not throwing hordes of crap at your face, a variety of different types (charms, armor, shields, weapons) and a good constant chance that you'll find a better weapon.\nFresh combat, based on linking combos in turns, but with enemies throwing all kinds of things at you, forcing you to change to survive.\nConstant updates\n\nCons:\nASCII graphics, if its not your thing\nExtreme difficulty, with not much of an option to make it easier than default, other than going into an extremely cheaty feeling mode where you cant die, its only a huge setback.\nSome random elements can be frustrating, such as trying to walk from point A to point B, but monsters attacking you about 10 times before you can reach point B.\nNot very open world, which I think would be a really fun addition to this game.\nSometimes its humor can be annoying, for example, my character saw something shiny on the ground. My choices were something like kick it, look at it, pick it up, or walk away. I chose to pick it up. It says something around the lines of \"you start to pick it up, but drop it, and it breaks forever. Oh well.\" I really wanted to know what that tiny thing was :(\n\nOverall, amazing game, exactly as it is. If I didn't know this was early access, I never would. I remember this being a pay-what-you-want game from a long time ago, and it has certainly come very far from that. I may be raving about how amazing it is, and maybe I went a bit overboard with all the adjectives, but all the pros and cons I made were all true. \n\n9/10, only getting better", "timestamp_created": 1420382763, "timestamp_updated": 1420382763, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "13824774": {"recommendationid": "13824774", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017079607", "num_games_owned": 317, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 538, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484353318}, "language": "english", "review": "At the time of the review it will only state that I played roughly under an hour.

I was very skeptical, yet curious what this game would be like, because I had a dream of a game that would combine the best elements from text adventures with the best elements of rpgs.\n\nI was wondering if this is the game I always had in my mind and wanted to play and I'm very excited to say that this game simply made my dream come true and it did not stop there! It actually expanded beyond what I could ever imagine would be possible in text-adventure-rpg type of game! Seriously! For example, I've played countless of text adventures in my life, but never, I repeat never any that would let you customize the personality and even look of your character, all in ASCII graphics. I can see clearly that authors had put seriously huge effort into introducing this genre into current generation of players, great job developers!\n\nAre you a fan of text adventures and rpg games like me or maybe more of a current-generation player, newcomer to this type of games and just little curious? Did you ever want to play a game that would combine the best from both genres and even beyond, apart from having the main game story line, adding multiple extra features, modern elements, side tasks, mining, crafting, building, shopping, talking with npc's, learning new game story related facts, learning and improving your in-game skills, fighting all kinds of monsters, magic, finding items from common things like wood planks for building, crafting to rare items, weapons, armor and other things to help you survive on your journey, exploring, looking for secret places, have fun and laugh at countless of funny moments, situations and things in game even at time and place you would never expect that? I know it is rather hard to imagine that all this and more would be included in a text adventure, but this game has it all and many more!\n\nIf this sounds good to you, look no further, this game IS for you. This game is beautifully crafted as a whole, it combines the best elements from text adventures and rpgs and the ASCII graphics and background music and sounds give it semi-retro feel. It's a game that will put a spell on you and make you addicted, make you want to play more and forget the real time and life around you, it's like a time machine that will send you to the past and let you feel the touch of old times both in game story and the unique game mechanics.\n\nI want to thank each and every person that helped to create this game and made my dream come true, I love this game, it's a real gem!

To the little gender fluid person out there, you don't have to worry about fitting yourself into the Male or Female box~ Rejoice!\n4) The game~ There is quite a lot of customization at the beginning, choosing class, race, augments, race,etc, there's so many!The story line is quite funny also ( Lol @Cyrus).

It may be an older version, but it gives you plenty of content to test and is very fun.\n\nNow, onto the review itself.\n\nSanctuaryRPG: Black Edition is a text based RPG based off the old classic RPGs, while also taking inspiration from many new-age RPGs and JRPGs.  Seeing as I'm a fan of reviews listing information about how the game is played and the strong points of it's systems, I'll explain a bit of it, and what I like about it.\n\nCombat:  This makes up a lot of the game, and as such, is an important system.  Combat works on a turn based system using abilities and combos.  Select one of your attacks with the corrosponding number or letter key, press enter.  Simple.  There are 6 different classes, each with their own attacks and special abilities, which gives the game great variety on how you like to combat your enemies.  In addition, all classes have their own ultimate abilities which are charged based on the use of combos.  Ultimate abilities work much like you think they would, and each one has it's own advantages.  The game also features lots of status effects and enemy affixes, which can change the pace and strategy of the fight significantly.  There's also many other different types of abilities with their own special uses you will unlock later in the game and experience for yourself.\n\nEvents:  This game features random events you may find throughout your adventure.  Events will usually occur when you find a secret area, indicated with either an [8] or a [x] on the scene depicted in the menu.  Events are usually some random choice based event.  One such event might go as follows:\n\n(A giant cow is blocking your path.)\n\n[1]  Jump on it.\n[2]  Kiss it.\n[3]  Smack it.\n[4]  Walk away.\n\nDepending on which answer you select, there may be consequences or rewards ranging from being damaged down to 1hp, healed to full health or being rewarded with a random item drop.  There's a wide variety of events, some more humorous than others, and plenty of loot to get from them.\n\nCrafting:  Yes, there's crafting, and the system for it is pretty neat as well.  Using different crafting abilities, and there's many more to unlock by leveling up your crafting skill, you need to fill the progress bar while also watching your durability, heat, and quality in order to ensure better stats.\n\nThese are a few of the systems inside of both the classic SanctuaryRPG and the new SanctuaryRPG: Black Edition.  I've played quite a bit of the classic, but only just gotten ahold of a copy of the Black Edition (Thanks again, Devs :D) and look forward to seeing all the differences and rebalances.\n\nOverall, I'd probably rate this game a good 82/100.

I remember playing the  game Ancient Domains Of Mystery (ADOM) as a teenager and absolutely falling in love with it.  Sancturary and ADOM are different beasts, except in their ASCII graphic style and their storytelling/dialogue that absolutely draws you in, as, well as their roguelike qualities.  But it's what they share that makes them so equally loveable.\n\nI won't pretend to completely understand ASCII or the ASCII art and graphic style, although you can find fascinating information about both on wikipedia.  All I know is that this art style and the ability to create pictures and the like from it is truly impressive.  Between the ASCII art, the programming made to create the game, and the creativity in the game world itself this game is absolutely worth 5 dollars if not more.\n\n  Random encounters, permadeath (only if you want it), multiple choices in every situation, random story and scenario situations ala roguelikes, mining, crafting, weapon/armor gambles, great soundtrack,  funny dialogue, engaging yet easily accesible combat, leveling, secrets, progression, etc, etc.\n\nthis game really has a lot to offer and for over 10,000 hours put into its making I feel like 5 dollars is an incredibly reasonable price.\n\nJust for reference the lead developer gave me a steam key for this game since i obtained the earlier version in a few bundles before it was on steam.  But honestly this game is so good i plan on buying it for at least two other people before the christmas season ends.  The developers for this game are absolute gentleman and they deserve as much praise as they can get!\n\nPlease upvote this if you agree that this game is amazing and/or if you would like to show the developers your appreciation!

This indie game is being (yes, it is still undergoing further development though it is essentially done) developed by a group called Black Shell Media. If I could describe this game simply, it is a multiple choice rogue like RPG with text based graphics. To play the game, you basically enter a number or letter corresponding to an action or location. You start as a (class of choice, race of choice) type deal, where each class has their own story beginning with plenty of witty and sometimes not at all subtle humour (the range character's story has something about sticking sharp things in bushes, some dirty humour like that). You then go on your quest which I will talk about later and do all amazing things with lots of jokes, including one about breaking the fourth wall, and progress until you come to your demise where the game will end and you will have to start from scratch. You have two base modes (normal and softcore which you can't die in but have 20% less loot drops). After you complete the game you then get harder game modes with better loot drops. Also there is something in the start screen about a character option which can only be changed from the default (potato) by finding the ultra rare drops of them in the game, so lots of replayability.\n\n\nShocker! This isn't going to melt your PC or need a GTX Titan Z to run. The aesthetics are nice and simple, but really suit the game. It has that retro feel of some of the first games, but with more colour and more detail. I admittedly was a bit sceptical when I first saw it because it's not really my kind of thing but after a while it grows on you. It is accompanied by a retro pokemon style background composition, which as far as I'm concerned is just fantastic and fits beautifully with the game.\n\nStory wise, you don't have much to work with. It is basically your typical medieval RPG, a witch called the \"Matron\" gets a super powerful sword and tries to destroy all life, super good wizard guy tries to stop her, goes missing after a big battle, you have to try and find and kill the matron. The rest of the story is pretty much a comedical combination of comedy and obscure (sometimes not so obscure) references. You also have a variety of features including blacksmith (weapons), crafting, a tavern which you can own, library (read books for free XP), Colosseum (battle things for XP and rewards), temple (burn things for charms) and market. So really there is a lot you can do if you're bored. You can also grind the holy bajesus out of places you've already beat. The story is overall pretty good, nothing new but works with the game and I like it.\n\n\nThis is the combat system for the game. Basically, you use starter moves, then linkers, then finishers to rack of damage, but you also have to heal a lot to (obviously heal) remove debuffs etc. You then have special abilities as well as an ultimate which stacks off your combo. Everything is colour co-ordinated so you know what's going on. I never got to master the combat system of repositioning to dodge and all that so I just spammed the attacks and healed whenever I needed to. This works to an extent, until you die in a ball of fire like I did every time I played. There is a sweet spot to it where, unless the RnG Gods choose it's really not your day, you can play it so you'll never die, which is really the idea. I am not a patient fellow, so I went in full attack mode and it really isn't the best approach. Very fun though.\n\n\nSo overall, this game is actually one of my favourites. When I first saw it on Steam, I didn't think I'd like it. But two hours of grinding, crafting and questing later, I found myself really into it to the point where it was getting harder for me to save and quit. There are a lot of really in-depth things I haven't went into including perks and upgrades, because they are pretty much something every RPG player will be familiar with, nothing new there, but there is an extent of the detail of these that is far beyond anything I've seen, even in the likes of Skyrim. I'm talking 3 pages of talking about a particular class' base perks. Pretty amazing. Want to know one of the best things about this game? Infinite hours of play time for \u00a33.99. That cheap. If you regularly find yourself bored and wanting something rewarding to do, buy this game. There is also a free trail. And if you are a rogue like lover, this is definitely for you.

The old version is still fun, but this one is even better!\n\nI am so happy this game was greenlit. I purchased it originally from the dev a while back, and its a game that I am proud to have supported.\n\nSanctuaryRPG takes a page from the old ASCII BBS games such as LORD and Exitilus. It is a work of ASCII art, proof positive that you dont need cutting edge graphics to make a great game. Each scene is rendered in ASCII art, and in cases there are hidden areas you can get to by pressing a key corresponding to a letter hidden in the picture. And its well-done ASCII art too.\n\nIt also has some of the best chiptunes to come out of a game in recent years. The music is just *awesome*. The fight music is probably the song I like the best. It really captures being in front of your NES, on the final boss that it took you hours and hours to get to.\n\nThe gameplay is simple. And like I said earlier, is reminiscent of the old BBS games. Its entirely keyboard driven, You wander from area to area, fighting monsters, exploring, travelling, and following the story. Random events happen as you \"travel\" - each area has a level. Going there triggers a fight (mostly), item drop, or random event.. These could be anything from an NPC, some loot, a story event, or even a secret area if you happen to find it on the map. To get from place to place - you press a key from a list. Theres hidden areas too. On the ASCII map, say theres an X in a door. Well you'd press X to go that way. Theres plenty of hidden places if you look for them.\n\nCombat, as the rest of the game is keyboard driven. You see your enemies health, and yours, a list of about 5-8 different things you can do, and a basic status of the enemy. There are plenty of options to choose from, and you can link diffrent combos and finishing moved together by expirimenting with the combat options. You also get overkill moves by accumulating rage points, or the enemy may gain a status buff/debuff or put one on you, causing you to have to break its guard, heal your bleeding, and so forth.\n\nHowever, fighting can get repetitive after a while. At least with the class I was playing, the same combo pretty much always worked, so I was just grinding through enemies over and over. Boss fights were a different story, and kept you on your toes as you switched your tactics constantly.\n\nThe possibility of fights becoming a bit grindy one of the few (admittedly minor) downsides, and my version was much older than this one, so it may have been changed.\n\nThe game is humorous, with plenty of gamer jokes and amusement, but it never feels like its beating you over the head with the silly factor . Its also suprisingly complex. Theres an arena, crafting (the crafting mechanic is really fun!), quests, and all kinds of random other stuff to keep you occupied when you need a break from the fights.\n\nIf you love ASCII art, get this game. If you love chiptunes, get this game. If you remember the BBSes, get this game.  Unless of course you demand fully rendered graphics and voiceovers with a minimap to point out exatly where you need to go and a million hints to hold your hand along the way...", "timestamp_created": 1418788912, "timestamp_updated": 1420431591, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.566197", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "13411537": {"recommendationid": "13411537", "author": {"steamid": "76561197984743207", "num_games_owned": 2124, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 696, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452739839}, "language": "english", "review": "There's more depth in this one than one 1st assumes; there's lots of entertainment value hidden so far.

I'm also deliberately reviewing it low in the playtime so I can cleanly state the facts as a fresh player, without the bias more hours would bring.\n\nWhat's the game like? Well simply put, its an old skool RPG Rogue-Like tactical combat game. It has the feel of an old adventure game from the 80s meshed with a TBS from the 90s, a sort of cross between a Rogue and Final Fantasy, with a hint of Douglas's adams Hitchikers Guide to the Galaxy for whimsy and charm and a 1st person Ultima game played in ASCII first person for the map. The mix of games sounds like a mess, it should not work, but in reality it holds together well as you have an interesting non-cliche RPG story with humour and a quest to finish, but is fleshed out with other elements like crafting, town base building by using cratables to upgrade the town, random procedual generated dungeons on the map and in the arena in town, all of which ties into the whole experince.\n\nIf you are a fan of the old school, early 90s rogue likes and your ultimas and final fanstasy games, please buy this game, as it has this vibe in spades. Also would highly recommend buying if your interested in combat tactics and not just pressing 1 to cast spell or 2 to drink potion, as like MMORPGS and some offline RPGS, your number keys do your class actions (of which there are many) but there is quite alot going on screen at any point, and any tactical errors such as forgetting to heal when bleeding out in one of the rounds, or forgetting to dodge at certain points will lead to death.\n\nIn terms of downsides, it does get hard later in the game and you really do need to know how your class skills interact and behave to survive later on and not be dispatched in quick order (but this may also be seen as a positive) and there may be some intitial getting used the interface needed as there is alot going on the screen per turn and when wandering around landscapes and towns, but if you willing to stick with it you get used to the ASCII style quickly.\n\nIn summary it's a game that is packaged in a unique, old skool style but it's one that understands the flows of a more modern tatical TBS game while not sacrificing what it means to be old skool in the first place, presented in great quality.

Light comes from a different direction depending on the time of day, but the time of day changes very rapidly which produces an encircling effect on more open areas of the level and if you're stuck in the vampire form this is gonna block you completely from moving until the (short) night comes. At that point \"gameplay\" seems to be reduced to hiding behind pillars and waiting for the light to go away, in a game where waiting means dying.\n\nEven though I imagine that with experience you could look at the minimap, clock and enemy placement to plan your every step, this sounds utterly tedious and not fun at all. At least regroup all info needed for movement decisions in a single place. To be honest I think the light would work much better as a static or very slowly changing feature rather than a bewildering whirlwind, given appropriate mechanics changes so that vampires can traverse these areas if they use the correct tools.\n\nI also got stuck in a situation where a cave was the only place I could safely go (I was a vampire on low life and the level above was very bright), but the way was blocked by water which meant insta-death. Means of changing from one form to the other are limited, and this seems to easily create gameplay dead-ends like this one.\n\nSo it saddens me to give a bad review to a traditional roguelike, but the flagship mechanic is really unintuitive and bothersome. I'll update my review if I revisit the game and it turns out to be actually fun.\n\n(For the record, I like some of the other innovations, such as giving you three possibilities for each potion instead of completely removing the ID system like some boring roguelikes do. Nice compromise between push-your-luck and predictable strategy. The game seems otherwise solid in its RPG and item mechanics.)", "timestamp_created": 1514145932, "timestamp_updated": 1514190237, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527901", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38304185": {"recommendationid": "38304185", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970314107", "num_games_owned": 1136, "num_reviews": 409, "playtime_forever": 98, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 21, "last_played": 1513231678}, "language": "english", "review": "Golden Krone Hotel has this incredibly jaunty tune that plays when you die, and I cannot get enough of it. Seriously, it\u2019s like a little festival breaks out as your character fades away and the restart options rise into view. It\u2019s such a little thing but it takes nearly all the sting out of dying, which is huge in a game where you die as much as you will here. It\u2019s also an excellent example of the care and attention put into crafting this roguelike adventure, and you can expect to find plenty more as you work your way through its twisting halls.\n\nYou are Sorina Arobase, a renowned general and famed vampire killer. She\u2019s on a mission of revenge against exiled vampire prince Fane, probably having something to do with how she tends to turn into a vampire from time to time. Her quest has brought her to the vast and looming Golden Krone Hotel, a mighty structure of many floors, chambers, and deadly inhabitants. Only by scrounging for gear and picking her battles will she eventually reach the dark object of her journey.\n\nSo yeah, she turns into a vampire sometimes. Golden Krone Hotel is very much a classic roguelike with its turn-based grid-based bump-based combat, but adorned with clever mechanics like bouts of vampirism. You generally start off in human form, with a meter that slowly fills over time. Once it\u2019s full you turn pale and ravenous, changing not only your looks but your stats, your skills, and how you interact with enemies and the environment. The floors are full of humans and vampires alike, and when in a particular form you\u2019ll only be attacked by those of the opposite species. Sunlight will burn you as a vampire and darkness will hide you, but as a human dark places limit your sight. And blood heals vampires, of course, but as a human you\u2019ll need to find time to rest.\n\nThe duality of your character is a major reason this title feels so fresh every time you start up a new character. You\u2019ve always got to mind the meter as a human so that you don\u2019t change while bathed in sunlight or surrounded by soldiers. And as a vampire you need to be lapping up blood whenever possible and carefully considering when to use your potions that restore you to human form. There\u2019s a lot of strategy wrapped up in this system, enough to make floors feel completely different depending on which form you approach them in.\n\nAs if that wasn\u2019t enough to consider, there are also twelve unlockable classes (disguises, they call them here) that start you off with different stats, skills, and forms. Skills can be learned from books you find but only in human form, and they provide powerful effects like invisibility and knockback. There\u2019s also a unique potion system that starts with every vial you find unidentified, but shows three possibilities of what it could be. For once this makes IDing items fun because you almost always  have to test them to tell, which will land you in situations where you really needed an antidote and gulped a face-full of noodles instead.\n\nThe rest of the structure is quite streamlined, with basic tiers of equipment that auto-equip if better than what you have and a simple leveling system with three familiar stats. This allows you to focus most of your attention on the unique systems and, of course, the challenge. Golden Krone Hotel is balanced around individual enemies being plenty deadly if you\u2019re unprepared, and groups nearly impossible to overcome. You\u2019ll need to make the most of your forms and your skills to survive more than just a few floors because the difficulty curve can feel like a brick wall until you really grok the strategy. The game has easy and normal difficulty modes but I\u2019m still beating my head against the early stages of easy here.\n\nIt\u2019s an unusual mix to be sure, a game with simple, unique systems and precipitous challenge. You would think the winning strategy would be obvious but it really isn\u2019t, being heavily dependent on enemy composition and your form and conditions and the environment around you. The design gives you fresh new tools to overcome traditional roguelike challenges, and it produces a title that feels like a classic without becoming boring or familiar. It\u2019s good for short sessions and silly deaths, or long marathons and serious focus, and manages to be fun either way.\n\nThe crunchy pixel art is perfect for a retro-styled roguelike, and there\u2019s even an option included to set it all the way back to ASCII. You already know what I think about the soundtrack but the effects and ambiance is top-notch as well, selling the gothic decay of the grand structure you find yourself in. It\u2019s a little harder to hang with than most roguelikes you\u2019ll find on Steam now, but the unique elements stand out more than enough to make it worth it. Golden Crone Hotel has the charm to keep me fighting its hordes of beasts and blood-suckers, and I don\u2019t expect the uphill battle to get boring anytime soon.\n\n\n\nDid you enjoy this review?

So when I started to play GKH, I was a bit dissapointed - equipment is basically just a number, and it seemed RNG heavy at first, so tactical play was limited.\n\nBut I felt the same way about many other RLs, so I knew I should just keep playing and trying new things. And this was right thing to do, because I was wrong. Playing as human, you are not supposed to fight everything with your standard attack - using magic is most important thing to do, and trying to find best ways to use it. Magic is most reliable - it's better than potions or physical attacks, and it's also very fun to use. Game (on hard difficulty) became much easier and much more tactical after I stopped relying on physical attacks. As a vampire, of course, there is much more physical fighting.\n\nTo new players I would recommend to stick with this game and to try wildly different approaches every time. Don't be afraid to try something new, even if it may get you killed. Game is short, so it's not a big deal to begin again. If you are willing to experiment, and don't forget to use everything you got at your disposal, you will have a good time in this game, especially if you like games with a lot of decision-making, tactics and zero grind. I definitely will add this game to my list of RLs that I play for tens of hours, forget about for a month or two and then start playing it obsessively again.\n\nAnd some things that I still dislike - equipment seems very boring. I don't feel any excitement about getting new sword. While I like every other mechanic in general, this one seems very disappointing and in my opinion, should be replaced with something more interesting that involves decision-making, and not just simple bonus that is completely random. I don't HATE this system, but it feels very \"gamey\" compared to everything else in the game, or even incomplete.\n\nEverything else is very minor and doesn't need to be here, because otherwise it's very fun and challenging game and I'm very thankful for Roguelike Radio episode that finally got me to try it!\n", "timestamp_created": 1502665062, "timestamp_updated": 1502665062, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519508", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34116765": {"recommendationid": "34116765", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004393508", "num_games_owned": 1270, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 606, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507240834}, "language": "english", "review": "A great coffeebreak roguelike! Sessions are short, sweet, and dangerous.\n\nEssentially you play as a human/vampire who swaps between the forms over time (or with the intervention of potions) and this influences what kind of enemies you have, if you can cast spells or shoot your gun, and if you spontaneously combust in sunlight! Which means this game has an amazing light/time system - depending on the time of the day the light streams in from all cardinal directions, and you can shoot out windows to set your vampiric opponents on fire.\n\nBasically it's a cool mechanic in a cool roguelike that's loaded with interesting takes on the genre's conventions - you identify potions by using them, but they can only be one of three different kinds, which makes guessing WAY safer, and more viable for emergency chugging, as there's a decent chance this potion might teleport you away, which would save your bacon!\n\nThere's a lot of content to this roguelike so far despite the early access, too - there's a comprehensive tutorial, side-branches, different classes, you can talk to all of the non-hostile enemies... it's real solid, and eventually I'll be good enough to meet some of the bosses.\n\nNow, minor downsides: no diagonal movement. This isn't really a downside, but I'm used to it in roguelikes, so it's just...odd. There's also not quite enough level layout variation yet, either. But these are my quibbles and in the end - buy this game.\n\nIt's really, really fun to play and dig into.

There are multiple player classes and every playthrough feels different and challenging.\n\nI wanna start by saying that this game won't be for everyone. It's a very strong roguelike, but allows you time to consider your movements through turn-based combat. Levels are filled with vampires, humans, a host of vile creatures that want to kill you, and plenty of loot to make you stronger for the higher levels to come.\n\nI admit that I never could make it up too many levels without making a costly mistake, but a lot of thought was put into making each experience unique. I'd find spells that would single-handedly help me get through the floors, or potions that would randomly teleport me into the midst of danger. It's very cool and I had a fun time just seeing how my experiences would turn out!\n\nAs mentioned before, there are multiple player classes but I had the most luck with the starter class and the abilities they have. Throughout your runs you'll inevitably turn into a vampire at some point, which is a way to play a completely different playstyle. You'll gain health from the fallen blood of your victims, and staying in the darkness renders you invisible. Of course, walking into a ray of light can also spell out your doom, but I digress.\n\nThere are plenty of roguelikes on Steam, but I say, definitely give this one a chance.

It lends some mechanics from games such as Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup, where you have to go into different branches in order to finish the game. However, this game is MUCH shorter (my wins have been around 30-40m I believe). There's many fun things about this game. If you'd like to see me play the game, please check out my let's play where my mission is to beat the game with all classes.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kt9UoCQNDW0\n\nPro's:\n- Difficult, but winnable. This is not one of these roguelikes that takes 20 years to practise to finally beat (I beat it on my tenth try). However, it can still be very difficult, and mistakes will cost you your life.\n- Difficulty levels! I told you I beat the game? Well...that was on easy! Time to go up a level!\n- Cool music\n- Very fun theme. You're a vampire hunter trying to find a vampire...however, throughout the game you gradually turn into a vampire yourself. This means that suddenly all vampires are friendly to you, but other hunters are your enemies all of a sudden. This takes planning to make the most of it.\n- Vampire and human form play very differently\n- Weather system. The sun comes up and goes down. During day, it travels from East to South to West. If you destroy windows, beams will come through there and damage any vampires in it (including you if you are a vampire!).\n- Very streamlined. Although you can run into spells and choose what you want there, whenever you find a weapon the game will decide whether it's better or not (as its a flat bonus). If it's better, it equips it, if it's not better, you get some gold.\n- Lots of hidden depth and secrets!\n- Lots of classes to play with (including a werewolf!)\n- No diagonal movement. To me this is a pro as I often play at airports and I don't have a numpad (and I'm too lazy to learn the traditional 'roguelike' movement keys)\n\n\nCons:\n- Although the tutorial is great, it did leave some things unexplained\n\n\nNeutral:\n- Not sure about the longevity. It doesn't have the depth of ToME, ADOM and DCSS, but then again, it also doesn't need to have it.

This is an awesome game to play if you're tipsy or intending to get there; runs are short enough that you won't mind very much if your character dies.\n\nA minor con for me is that there's no inventory management; you always use the most damage-causing weapon you find, and there are no weapons that are appropriate for Situation A but not Situation B.  But, realistically, if that were added, it would be a different game and not necessarily a better one.\n\nI feel that this would be scalable down to mobile and I rather hope they do an iOS version; I would enjoy playing this on my phone.

But it makes up for this simplicity with uniqueness of the games elements and a generally newbie friendly feeling to it. The key mechanic of the game is that you are a vampire that can briefly take on the guise of a human with all their attributes. You get different advantages and weaknesses depending on what form you are in.\n\nFor example, in Human form you are relatively weaker but you can make use of magic, can read books, and can use a shiny gun to dispatch of your enemies. Changing into a Vampire you are much stronger and can gain many hunter abilities (like the ability to see in lowlight) but you become stupid and can't use books or ready magic, or understand how to use a gun. You also are affected by sunlight - which is another unique element in the game.\n\nUnlike other games in the Rogue-like genre, you have an active lighting system which sees the sun gleaming through the windows; or perhaps the light of the moon. As this is a game where you have vampires and other unearthly beings that are affected by the sun, this can play a key role in how you play the game. Use the sun to burn enemy vampires - or if you are a vampire, you need to watch out for the burning light when it may shine on you!\n\nThere are also other enemies in the game to deal with too, and probably more content worthy of exploring as well. Some things that I noticed were multiple classes that you can start with and different zones to visit as you progress onward.

None of this fumbling around to remember which key you have to press to drink a potion or something. Everything is at your fingertips. This leaves you free to enjoy the strategy of the game without the massive learning curve often present in other roguelikes.\n\nI could end the review there and many roguelike fans would be satisfied, but that's not all there is to this title. We haven't even touched on what makes this game great. The number one thing is the vampirism mechanic. You can start as a human or as a vampire, but you are always BOTH. If you are a human, you have a vampire meter which slowly grows until you transform. If you're a vampire, you find potions that transform you back into a human. The humans have guns and magic while the vampires have increased combat skills\n\nAside from that, the coolest thing is the light mechanic. There is light, moonlight, and dark. Humans are not affected by light, but have trouble seeing in the dark. Vampires can see in the dark and use it for stealth, but they are dealt massive damage by sunlight. The light moves in accordance to what time it is in game. If you are a human, you can shoot out the windows or blast them with a magic spell to let light shine through. However, keep in mind that light only shines through the windows during the right time of day!\n\nIt's worth noting that you can also play as a werewolf. I'm not as familiar with this aspect of the game yet. All I really know is that you are somehow positively affected by moonlight.\n\nThose who like roguelikes to be hard as nails, but want a streamlined experience should love this game.

For how much that term is thrown around on Steam, there really aren't too many.[/b]\n\n[i]For the small asking price, you [i]need[/i] this little gem in your library. Here is why:[/i]\n\n1. The use of light (sunlight and artificial) in this game is fantastic. A breath of fresh air, really. This combined with how you swap between being human and vampire (and all consequences attached), just makes for something really awesome. I cannot stress this enough. Most roguelikes get by on simply following the formula, but when awesome new mechanics are thrown in - it really makes for something special.\n\n2. Inventory management has been paired down to just the essential, without feeling like some mobile casualty decision. If something is better, you auto-equip. If not, it is instantly converted to money. Boom, roasted.\n\n3. Controls have also been paired down, which is great. WASD to move, F to fire the gun, E to select, P for potions. Thats the vast majority of what you will be using. It's great. \n\n4. While it is early access, it very much feels finished - and is beatable at this point. I'd love to see more, but if the dev up and ran, I'd still be more than happy with what I have for five bucks.\n\nAlright, I'll leave it at that. All I can say is you really should give this a try. Playing as a human has a whole set of nuances and strategy that differ from when you are converted into a vampire. All of a sudden those precious light beams that are a weapon for humans, are now deadly if you are a vampire. The changing day cycle determines what side of the castle the light comes into the windows, really adding strategy. You shoot out windows and let the light flood in to insta-kill vampires. It's a crazy cool idea that really works.\n\n[b]A must-buy for fans of roguelikes.[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1477754074, "timestamp_updated": 1477754099, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.660350", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "26291842": {"recommendationid": "26291842", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972901617", "num_games_owned": 301, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 41, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484324021}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a very promising start to a game that has a very strong setting, a good amount of humour, and a solid character-transforming mechanic.

Golden Krone Hotel takes what is best on this formula and adds nice features like the use of the everchanging sunlight as a weapon, if you're on the human form, and as something to be terrified about, if you're a vampire. That's right - the gameplay consists on playing with both forms and you need to make the best use of them if you want to survive. \n\nDon't be fooled by the Early Access label; this game is very polished, playable and beatable.

The sound effects are great and the soundtrack may be one of the best, if not the best, I've heard on this kind of game. Also, there are some little details that makes the game even more fun, like the possibility to find and drink an Ale beer!

Its systems are simpler than say, Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup (which it shares inspiration from) but makes up for it with a tight balance, and really neat additions. I've been playing this game since its inception as a 7 Day Roguelike during the jam. The Early Access release goes above and beyond. \n\nYou make your way upwards, killing baddies, casting spells, and firing your firearm, while doing your best to stay alive. One of the great things about this game is its almost puzzle-like enemies. Bats have a large movement speed, and often hit and run. Spiders can chain stun you, but do low damage by themselves. Golems are more susceptible to blast damage. Etc. Over the course of a few runs, you learn each enemy, and how they act, what they're weak to, and how to best overcome them while in packs with other baddies. Light is very important in this game. Vampires will take damage in sunlight, (more on vampires later) and being in the dark has its pros and cons. While you gain a stealth bonus, enemies that can see in the dark will not be fooled by this trick. Lighting torches is a good way to keep the field visible.\n\nGolden Krone Hotel's main focus is its different forms. Over time, you start to turn into a Vampire. This means that sunlight will also affect you, you can see in the dark, vampires will be passive while humans hostile, and you cannot cast spells. These gameplay changes make playing as a vampire a very viable option for many circumstances. I find using that form during travel very useful, as you don't lose hunger, only health. You regain that by feasting on nearby humans or taking one of the game's numerous potions. \n\nSpeaking of potions, another streamlined area is identification of items. Instead of a miriad of potential options, the game gives you three possibilities for each. Discerning what is what is less risky, so panic-quaffing happens more often. Items in general are much more easily managed. Picking up a new piece of equipment will either cause you to exchange it for gold if it is worse, or equipping it in the other circumstance.\n\nI feel like I could talk about the depth of the game's mechanics for ages.

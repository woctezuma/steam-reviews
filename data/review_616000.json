In terms of story you play as a ronin-like samurai on his way to attack an opposing force mainly consisting of dragons of different sizes and abilities inside a dungeon while wielding nothing but his sword.\n\nI have to say, this is the game with the most felt impact on each kill in a long time. And the simple graphics don't interfere with that at all. This was my first impression and it lasts until now. Because of that the combat feels very satisfying.\n\nMentioned feeling gets intensified by the immediate risk any attack on an enemy implies. There's no blocking or other dedicated defensive movement option to get out of harm's way - you'll have to do one of two things to try and dodge out of a foe's expected aggressive reaction: You can jump. This is only possible if you happen to stand on ground at the time you are in need of evasion and is - depending on the type of enemy you're facing - more or less high risk. To resort to this normally means that you have run out of attacks and therefore the other possibility of retreat: The slash. You can slash three times in a row and move quite a distance along the way. One one hand this is a much safer method of avoiding attacks and is usually the better way to do that. On the other hand it requires planning ahead and keeping your cool, containing the last attack for an emergency or slash-dash in a triangle to return to your safe position in the end. Depending on the complexity of the room and the visibility of it's parts (if it's very high you might not see what's upwards or worse down below in case of a fall) this is not always easy and you will have to take risks now and again. Sometimes it's also important that your attacks are spot on, which brings me to the central gameplay element of Riptale: The slashes.\n\nThey can be best described as a kind of running / jumping straight forward attack with a sword strike at the end which both play out in lightning speed. This slash hits not only straight forward (or the exact direction of the attack), but a little later also registers some way behind the fighter. Aside from bosses I haven't met any foe that didn't die instantly from one hit. On the other hand your fighter takes four hits to die on normal difficulty (one on hard). Standing on flat ground you can attack forward and even when you slash partly down (but still also left or right) the samurai will rush exactly horizontally, even when he runs over a gap or into thin air, but the following slash will 'fire' in the exact direction your analog stick was facing, enabling a few strong tactics against lower placed foes. But you can also aim into the air or / and attack subsequently while not touching ground. From jumping, while falling, in all directions, even downward - until your three actions (represented as gems) run out. Then you'll have to wait shortly for them to replenish - long enough to get you in serious danger if you are in the wrong spot. Many reviewers describe the handling as lacking in precision. I think this feeling comes from two things: Firstly, the distance covered with one slash is enormous and it's quite difficult to predict where exactly your fighter will stop. Secondly, as soon as you hit some enemies or other obstacles you stop, even if the slash hits one or more targets behind it. Combined with the fast pace of movements (also some enemies') the struggle against the layout of the rooms sometimes amounts to quite a challenge. When adding the roguelike element of luck when in need of healing hearts this can quite often seem unfair. I had my best runs while keeping calm without focusing too much on achieving anything.\nConcerning the possibilities of healing you sometimes get hearts from killed foes and crates or urns which replenish one hit on your fighter. But you can also find money. It can be spent in randomly occurring shops. These (randomly) offer attack gems different from the straight slash. Since the fighter has three slots representing the chainable attacks you get to choose when the bought variant activates. I had much fun playing around with different combinations, because other than in some roguelites I ran into an opportunity without having nearly the amount of needed money only once thus far. And that might have come from clumsily missing lots of coins in the rooms before.\nWhich brings me to a point I like and dislike at the same time: While you can go back to previous rooms to your left and right and even take the contents there indefinitely (meaning neither coins nor hearts dissolve - kudos to you, developers !), once you fall down into a room you're cut off. You can't go back up, not even using your slashes. Since you can't pan down while standing on safe ground you'll often need to do a 'leap of fate' (no misspelling) which might draw you into a slashing fight with dangerously positioned foes while driving you into spending all your attacks. If you end up floating over a downward exit at that time you will simply fall down, because there is no double jump, forcing you to abandon all (possible) coins and hearts. While I can live with that, this may concern some players who struggle a little with roguelike elements, because this might make some runs much harder - especially luckless ones.\n\nAll in all, I recommend you watch some short reviews or Let's Plays of the game and at the same time keep my description of the combat flow in mind. That way you might be able to figure out if Riptale is for you or not. I won't try to explain graphics or music to others, because that's easily solved nowadays - with all that media out there.\nWhile sceptical at first I got a gem out of a sale that I'd have paid more than the full price for had I known what awaited me beforehand.", "timestamp_created": 1511795428, "timestamp_updated": 1511795428, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37244164": {"recommendationid": "37244164", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025004266", "num_games_owned": 277, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 506, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511674504}, "language": "english", "review": "Riptale is an excellent platform/fighting game where you have three gems that represent your attack combo and they do massive, high mobility attacks that chain together and let you dash around like an absolute madman and kill any non-boss that you hit - but with the catch that they take a bit of time to regenerate. The attacks are extremely satisfying; the sound, the hit slow-motion, the mobility, the way blood sprays out, it's great. It's also pleasingly tactical; you have to consider how the enemies will move as you approach and where your attacks will carry you so you can get in, land your hits and then end somewhere safe to pause for a second to get ready to attack again.

There's no reason to wait for a sale, get this game ASAYCAI [i](as soon as you can afford it).[/i] It is very fun, easy to pick up and difficult to master. The difficulty comes from some design flaws, like the fact that enemies can cheap shot you with a clairvoyance that is utteraly ridiculous, right as you enter a room... or that controls are in fact [i]too[/i] precise. \n\nYou do have to aim at your target before striking, and while it may seem like the controls are a little off - they are in fact incredibly pinpoint, almost to a fault. The angle and timing really matter, even more so given that you only have up to 3 consecutive attacks. If you have good spatial awareness, you'll get used to having to adjust your angle by literally a fraction of a degree. This could mean the difference between executing a sweet combo... or just getting executed.\n\nThe biggest issue I have with the game is the BG Music for the main levels. It's the exact same looped track and it does not really vibe well with the music in the Menu, Shops and \"secret\" Lore Rooms. It's way too fast-paced, and bass drum heavy to be the song that you're hearing throughout most of your playtime. The 16-bit Midi feel is great, but every other song in the game is much better than the main track imo. It wouldn't be so bad if it switched every 3 or so stages after you find the lore room.\n\nWould also be nice if you had the ability to switch the locations of your abilities at will, but maybe in a future update?

You have acquired three arcane gems that allows you to perform attacks on the dragons with your sword. You venture forth on a mission to kill as many dragons and their servants as possible. \nIn your journeys you collect gold from slain enemies and destructible items on the levels. You can use that gold in sparsely, scattered shops to by different and arcane gems that alters the way your attacks work, such as a quick-draw dash attacks, double and triple attacks,  homing attacks. You can chose in which order those appear and thusly create new combos. \nIn your journeys you may also come across magic rune stones that alter how you play, such as making you bunny jump, move faster or having more gems but not regenerating health.\nYou start with 4 hearts and getting hit by an enemy or their projectiles removes a heart - at zero hearts you die. But luckily enemies and destructible items on the levels can drop hearts. There is also one heart at the end of every lelve.\nSome levels may also have challenges that range from navigating a maze in darkness on time, not taking damage or killing all enemies in the room. Completing a challenge awards you with a trinket - a collectible item in the game.\nEach stage has 3 regular levels and then a boss level. Defeating a boss grants a bonus such as more gems and more hearts. All the levels, except the boss levels, are procedurally generated. \n\nThe narrative is delivered through the intro and books found in library on some levels and books between levels. Those are entirely optional to read, but gives a nice insight into why the ruin you just traversed became a ruin or why the garden you just got through was abandoned. \n\nThe game uses a minimalist 2D art-style. The base game is black, white and red, but as you progress in the game you can unlock different screen filters, such as the \"classic\" filter, which is green and reminds me of a nintendo gameboy or a red one which reminds me of the virtual boy. The screen filters does not affect the gameplay and is purely cosmetic. The game is well optimized and will run smoothly on most machines.\n\nThe soundtrack is uptempo and upbeat and will have your adrenaline pumping as you slay the dragons and their minions and strive for survival. The sound effects are top quality and helps you immerse yourself in the slaughtering. \n\nRiptale has near-infinite replayability as the levels are procedurally generated and there are plenty of different gem / attack combos for you to discover, not to mention that the difficulty is high, so even just defeating a boss will be challenging by itself. You will easily find yourself telling yourself \"just until I die next time, just one more try\".\n\n[code]Submitted for [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/elitegives]Elite Giveaways[/url] and [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/semeigaming]Semeicardia Gaming[/url].[/code]", "timestamp_created": 1496332058, "timestamp_updated": 1496332210, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.609509", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32097499": {"recommendationid": "32097499", "author": {"steamid": "76561198192660225", "num_games_owned": 813, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 25, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496175091}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Entretenido, cl\u00e1sico y retador.\n\nRiptale es un juego 2D en ambientaci\u00f3n a los juegos antiguos de mec\u00e1nica simple pero con un grado de dificultad desafiante que te mantiene pegado a la pantalla aplicando los combos de ataque con destreza para no morir.\n\nTu objetivo es simple, matar a los enemigos mientras recorres el mundo, puedes jugarlo de forma casual o leyendo las notas que encontrar\u00e1s en el camino para enterarte de la histora; al comienzo es dificil acostumbrarte a tener reflejos r\u00e1pidos, pero a medida que juegas te acostumbras a ello, haciendote sentir genial por lograr esos combos ejecutados a la perfecci\u00f3n.\n\nRecomendado por su ambientaci\u00f3n, su dise\u00f1o y su estilo de pelea algo peculiar, perfecto para pasar un rato de ocio.", "timestamp_created": 1496278355, "timestamp_updated": 1496278544, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.427184", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32079569": {"recommendationid": "32079569", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003352401", "num_games_owned": 693, "num_reviews": 148, "playtime_forever": 144, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493395985}, "language": "french", "review": "Lorsque j\u2019ai re\u00e7u la cl\u00e9 du jeu dans ma bo\u00eete mail et que je suis all\u00e9 voir les screenshots de pr\u00e9sentation, je me suis dit \u201cbelle repompe de Downwell\u201c.

However, if you do not have a controller, hate dying repeatedly or are looking for deep gameplay or story then I would suggest giving this a miss.\n\n[u] Gameplay [/u]\n\nYou start with 3 gems which you can expend to perform various slashing attacks. After each slash the game slows down briefly allowing you to chain together attacks and after a gem is expended you must wait for it to recharge. Your goal is to descend each cavern system and take out the boss at the bottom. You can get hit by enemies a total of 4 times before dying.\n\nSounds fairly simple, yes? Well it is. However, the controls make it much more difficult. To aim the attack, you've got to point the left-stick in the direction you wish to strike however you also use the left-stick to walk meaning that you've got to aim reflexively (Not to mention there's no reticle either). Personally it took me about an hour and a half to become comfortable with the controls, YMMV.\n\nScattered around the levels you can find boxes and vases which can be broken to find coins and hearts (monsters also drop these). The coins can be used at shops to replace your current gems with new ones with different attacks. This adds a little bit of variety to the combat as it allows you to adopt different styles of move differently.\n\nOccasionally you may find rooms off to the side which contain a stone tablet which give you some kind of wacky effect (From 3 extra gems to impossibly fast and slidey movement) or a challenge room which allows you to unlock various collectables.\n\nOnce you reach and defeat the boss you will be given a power-up (an extra gem or heart IE.) and released onto on of the other dungeons to defeat that boss. The power-up is temporary and will be lost after you die or restart the game. Looking at the achievements there also seems to be a \"main boss\" that I assume you would fight after defeating all the dungeons in one playthrough.\n\nDeath isn't a really big deal in this game. When you die you just simply hit restart and you'll respawn at the top of a random dungeon. I never felt like I was waiting around for the game to start again. Though there's probably about 5 seconds between dying and respawning, which might be too much for the easily frustrated.\n\nThe dungeon layout seems to be random, which makes sense given the number of times you're going to be replaying it. However, I feel like this game would benefit from a slightly more structured approach. I'd definitely be interested in a metroidvania with the same mechanics.\n\n[u] Graphics [/u]\n\nAt first the graphics are rather harsh due to their start black/white style, though after some time it doesn't really bother you. However, if it does irritate you, you'll quickly start unlocking filters (Faded, Green etc.). The graphics can get rather repetitive, however, they're still quite well done and look great with blood splattered all over them.\n\nEnemies look pretty good, the black/white/red aesthetic and animations differentiate them from the background however they can blend into the background sometimes, however this seems intentional as the ones that are often hard to recognize tend to be smaller, less troublesome enemies.\n\n[u] Sound [/u]\n\nThe soundtrack is awesome. Everyime I start up the game and I hear the music kick in it really gets me in the mood to slaughter a room of undead, cultists and dragons. \n\nThe sound effects used in the game are really well done, however I think a sound for when you run out of gems would be helpful in addition to making the sound of gems recharging a lot louder than they currently are. More feedback sounds in general would be helpful.\n\n[u] Story [/u]\n\nThere isn't really an in-depth story as such. It's basically summed up in the intro as \"dragons show up, kill everyone and can only be hurt by certain people able to use magic gems, one such warrior is questing around to exterminate them\".

The combat is probably the most satisfying of any game ever, which is great. My complaints about the game don't even begin to overshadow how fun this is. For $5, it's a must buy.\n\nHowever, I have some complaints with the game, and I think my biggest complaint is that there's no sense of area progression. Areas are randomized as far as I can tell, so your first level could be any of the game's levels. The red and white theme also makes sure that all of the levels really blend together. I played for over an hour and at all times I could never really tell you which level I was on or how long my run had been. None of the areas ever say \"Level 2\" or anything, so there's no way to know how long your run has even lasted. The fact that there's no sense of progression really hurts this game in my opinion.\n\nThe artstyle is a bit difficult to get past for me. Although it definitely looks cool, restricting the whole palette to three colors gives serious limitations which hinder the game's enjoyment. Having different areas be different colors would be a great way to differentiate them, which would solve some of the progression issue. However, I'm sure the developer is married to the style they created, so the most I can ask is to PLEASE make non-interactive scenery pieces a light gray rather than a white. It would be so much easier to interpret everything going on on screen if there was at least a little bit of differentiation between the important objects and the scenery.\n\nThere's a few other improvements I'd really like to see patched in. First of all, the D-pad doesn't work on controllers, which I'm sure would be simple to code in. Secondly, the antialiasing on the homing attack looks INCREDIBLY out of place compared to the rest of the tricolor graphics. There's also no way to see your health unless you get hurt, which I think is a mistake. I understand that this game is trying to stay minimal, but you can even see your gold at all time. Your gold count only matters when you're in a shop, but health matters *always*. So, that would be a good improvement.\n\nThe mechanic of switching out your gems is cool, but there's a few ways it could be made better. First of all, there's no way to rearrange your gems unless you're in a shop. This seems like something that would give the player more choices without affecting balance, so I'd really like to see it added. Next, there isn't much of an explanation as to what each gem does. I'd love to see a menu when you press select that lets you rearrange your gem and see a more detailed description of their mechanics. I admire the simplicity of \"show, don't tell\", but I honestly can't tell what some of the gems do compared to normal gems, even after playing with them for a while.\n\nI really hope the developer(s) keep working to improve this game.

You go through randomly generated levels and hack/slash through the enemies. Literally. There\u2019s lots of blood and when you strike an enemy, you really go through him. Non-boss enemies die from one hit, but you must plan your attacks carefully, because it\u2019s pretty easy for them to hit you too.\n\n[h1]The Good[/h1]\n-\tHitting enemies feels great. The blood, the slow-down of time at the moment of impact that allows you to start another combo.\n-\tChallenging Difficulty: the game is really hard and unforgiving, although if you mess up - you know it was your fault most of the time\n-\tGood selection of music and sounds. The music can get repetitive after a while, but it never felt annoying. The hit sounds are very satisfying: it\u2019s exactly as you would imagine when you think about something alive that got hit by a sword.\n-\tCustomizable attack combos: you don\u2019t have a traditional attack cooldown. Instead, you have three attacks (gems). Each attack costs one gem, so you can do three rapid attacks at once. Gems replenish over time though, so you can\u2019t combo immediately. The interesting thing is you encounter shops as you progress in the game, and those sell special gems that can alter your attack pattern and make you stronger. This is the main way to change your strategy and playstyle. For example, as you play, you discover that placing some gems in first position makes charging harder, so you put them in second attack position (i.e. your first attack remains normal, but second attack becomes homing, allowing to kill the enemy quickly if he dodged).\n\n[h1]The Bad[/h1]\n-\tCollisions could be better. Occasionally you go through flying enemies without damaging them. \n-\tGems are not recharged when you enter new room. If the game expects to have a fast gameplay, it\u2019s a bit counter-intuitive to have player stand in one place and wait till the gems are refilled. \n-\tAiming controls felt subpar quite a while: the 45-degree directions are fine, but enemies that are located at a different angle from you are frustrating to hit.\n-\tSlow-mo during falls could be useful. From time to time you get into situation when you jump down a platform and collide with a monster below (but there was no way to see it).\n-\tThe levels are randomly generated. Traversing some rooms is not very pleasant due to a huge number of obstacles or maybe randomly placed stuff. The level compositions seems to be a bit broken and the gameplay speed gets hindered because of that.\n\n[h1]Summary[/h1]\nWhat game excels at is the feel when you kill something: once your character cuts an enemy, you know this was for real.

And also, enjoy your fair share of difficult gameplay, where missing a few hits can mean you're going to end up dying? Then this game might just be it for you.\n\nRiptale is a very simple looking game, however, what it lacks in intricate looks it more than makes up for in hard and punishing but very enjoyable gameplay.\n\n[b]So why is the gameplay hard and punishing? [/b]\nThe game uses a system called \"gems\", you have room for 3 \"gems\" at a time. Everytime you start the game you will have the 3 default gems that are just a normal slash, but throughout the game you'll be able to acquire new gems, for instance by buying them from the store. These gems contain different styles of attacking, however, you still only have 3 hits that recharge very slowly, so if you miss an attack you're boned. However, whenever you do kill something the time will slow down for a little bit giving you just enough time to figure out your next move.\n\n[b]So what about the aesthetics? [/b]\nThe game looks very simple yes, but I don't think I would've enjoyed the game much more with more colours, the black and white scheme with the occasional red streaks really helps with looking through a room, if it were a bit more complex this might have interfered with the gameplay making everything just a blurry mess of colours.\n\n[b]So what about the progression?[/b]\nThe game is of the genre most known as \"rogue-like\" this means that you enter a (usually) randomly generated level in which you must keep advancing rooms (or screens) to move on with the game. So far I've noticed that levels are ordered by an area for instance \"Fungi Caverns\" and after you have progressed through the area by traveling through rooms you go to a next area, after 3 areas total you will have to fight a boss. Unfortunately I've not yet beaten a boss so, I do not know what happens after one.\n\n[b]What about the technical details?[/b]\nThe game is locked to 60 fps, and launches in a small window, the only way to increase the size of the window is by going into full screen which will just enlarge everything.\nThere's a master sound option and an individual slider for sound effects.\nYou can also remap the keys used in the game.\n\n[b]So, would you recommend this game?[/b]\nIf the topics I addressed in this post have you interested I'd say give it a go, and don't forget if you do not enjoy the game you can always use steam refunds if you've not played for more than 2 hours, so, I would give this game a go, as you might be surprised to how fun this game can be.\n\n[b]You've been pretty positive so far surely there's some downsides?[/b]\nYes, the game has its fair share of bugs and weird interactions, but so far nothing I've encountered has truly ruined my gameplay in anyway, also the random generation could be looked at a little better as at one point I've had it randomly generate 3 stores in a row on consecutive screens.\n\nIf you would like to find out more check out My Perspective at: https://youtu.be/s7zHbSw0Q9c", "timestamp_created": 1493319827, "timestamp_updated": 1493387091, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.554795", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31398947": {"recommendationid": "31398947", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045595134", "num_games_owned": 1916, "num_reviews": 63, "playtime_forever": 33, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492897611}, "language": "german", "review": "Riptale ist ein Spiel, welches einfach aussieht, im Kern aber echt schwer sein kann, und ich empfehle dringend, es mit einem Controller zu spielen. \n\nDas Kampfsystem basiert darauf, aus m\u00f6glichst wenigen Angriffen das beste zu machen. Man hat sogenannte Gems, die stellen da, wie oft man angreifen darf. 3 Gems bedeuten also, dass man drei Mal hintereinander angreifen darf. Mit dem Analogstick bewegt man sich normal, bestimmt aber auch, in welche Richtung man mit dem n\u00e4chsten Angriff st\u00fcrmt/dasht. So kann man also auch erst nach oben, dann nach rechts und anschlie\u00dfend direkt nach unten angreifen und damit die Gegner in der Umgebung erledigen. Dazu gibt es dann auch M\u00fcnzen, mit denen man sich bei versteckten H\u00e4ndlern Gegenst\u00e4nde kaufen kann, die einem verschiedene Boni geben. Stirbt man, f\u00e4ngt man wieder von vorne an, jedoch nicht unbedingt auf der ersten Ebene.\n\nDazu gibt es auch verschiedene Gegnertypen, wie andere Ninjas, die entweder auf einer Ebene bleiben und nur dort angreifen, sowie weitere, die auch nach oben dashen und den Charakter verfolgen. Schlagen, fliegende Drachenk\u00f6pfe und noch einige weitere Gegner erwarten einen dort ebenfalls, es wird also nicht so schnell langweilig.\n\nDie Grafik ist wie man sie halt auf den Bildern sieht, eigentlich ist es gar nicht mein Stil, aber das rote Blut erinnert mich sehr an Sin City, die Filme fand ich wiederum gut. Manchmal ist es aber auch schwer, die Gegner direkt zu erkennen, das kann aber auch gewollt sein. Der Fenstermodus ist f\u00fcr mich pers\u00f6nlich viel zu klein, ich konnte da kaum etwas erkennen, also kann ich nur empfehlen, das Spiel im Fullscreen zu spielen.\n\nZum Sound kann ich nur sagen, dass mir die Hintergrundmusik sehr schnell auf den Zeiger ging, sodass ich diese schnell ausgeschaltet habe, zum Gl\u00fcck kann man ja auch seine eigenen Musik dazu h\u00f6ren. Die weitere Soundkulisse h\u00f6rt sich dagegen gut an, und durch das Ger\u00e4usch einer Klinge, die durch ein Hinderniss schneidet, bekommt man auch audiotechnisch Feedback f\u00fcr gelandete Treffer.\n\nIch kann das Spiel jedenfalls weiter empfehlen, besonders, wenn man mal etwas f\u00fcr zwischendurch sucht, das aber auch etwas fordert und mitunter auch schnelle Reaktionen ab verlangt.", "timestamp_created": 1493316842, "timestamp_updated": 1493316842, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31398776": {"recommendationid": "31398776", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025691757", "num_games_owned": 12, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 46, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493327221}, "language": "english", "review": "Fast-paced, challenging, fun!", "timestamp_created": 1493316312, "timestamp_updated": 1493316312, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31398372": {"recommendationid": "31398372", "author": {"steamid": "76561198170795925", "num_games_owned": 339, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 282, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501161723}, "language": "turkish", "review": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DAOi97PQs&t=697s\n\nOyun 2 boyutlu bir platform aksiyon macera oyunu.\nGer\u00e7ekten men\u00fc m\u00fczi\u011fini o kadar sevdim ki bu incelemeyi yazarken arkada a\u00e7\u0131p dinlemeye ba\u015flad\u0131m :D \nOyun i\u00e7i b\u00f6l\u00fcm m\u00fczikleri de gayet g\u00fczel olsa da benim favorim men\u00fc m\u00fczi\u011fi oldu.\n\u00d6ncelikle \u015funu s\u00f6yleyeyim oyunumuz biraz zor.

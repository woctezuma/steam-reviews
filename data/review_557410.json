I've heard the very primitive/silly art in the game was done by his pre-teen daughters.\n\nDon't be put off by the art, this is one of the deepest, most well designed strategy games around.  Similar to other pseudo-random games like FTL, you may be put off in the beginning by \"bad luck\", but know there are highly talented players who can go on incredible win streaks by optimizing every single decision made in a game.\n\nClasses have mana (blue), action points (green), HP, can get an equipment slot (rather than having to draw and play an Equipment card, you just start with it in play), and have all sorts of different talents with a cooldown based on their class.  Thieves find extra treasure, warriors can duplicate 1 card or go berserk, monks can delete unwanted cards from their deck... there are 4 starting classes and 10 more to unlock, including advanced ones like the professor (steals and keeps cards from a monster's deck) and dragons (can't use shops but can devour monsters whole, and depending on the monster type devoured gets various bonuses and different cards)\n\nRed \"attack\" cards are played for \"free.\"  Most classes start with the lowly \"attack 1\" but only certain classes get access to the high attack based cards like Rallying Stroke.  Blue spell cards require mana.  Some classes like the Necromancer steal mana and can start combat with a very high starting mana count, which means they may not need to put different cards that add mana to them before they can finish off opponents.   Other types of casters may want to equip a Staff that deals damage as they gain mana through cards.   Even some \"non casters\" get access to spells like Blur (half physical damage taken for 1 turn), I had a monk with a very small deck that included 1 Wisdom (Gain 3 mana, draw a card) and 1 Blur and by cycling and drawing could usually draw its entire deck every turn and keep that Blur up the entire fight. \n\nExplore a map and fight 70+ different monster types.  Get to know them, because they all have different strengths, weaknesses, and gimmicks.  Most classes have various abilities that let them explore, scout the map and see which monsters will be easy, which will be hard, and which may be impossible for your particular deck.  A wizard may want to teleport past a particularly nasty magic-immune monster.  Or, it may hatch a plan to try one of the toughest monsters first, use its long cooldown that doubles damage and lowers resistance for 1 turn, (and maybe use Flee if it gets a bad draw).  It may want to fight some medium-difficulty monsters first and time its level ups off of easier monsters to maximize the amount of healing gained.  If it scouts that the final Floor Boss is a Titan, it may want to save money for that Crumble (exile equipment or Prayer card) in a shop to deal with its nasty starting equipment.  If you don't know the last boss is a Titan, you maybe didn't save for the Crumble, and you probably get owned.\n\nThere's lots of things to unlock, and there is a system where every game gives you a score.  You can use points from your accumulating score to \"buy\" achievement unlocks that have been particularly stubborn.", "timestamp_created": 1514231623, "timestamp_updated": 1514231623, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38599368": {"recommendationid": "38599368", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029308294", "num_games_owned": 488, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 341, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489215244}, "language": "english", "review": "Please don't be put off by the awful graphics.

Why release a game that doesn't even have cute pixels to fool everyone into thinking it is retro? Such a target for critics.

There are two components to this title, the world 'board', and the fighting card game. The card game is a deck builder nearly identical in both playstyle and strategy to the IRL card game [i]Dominion[/i]. If you haven't played that card game, I guess in effort of keeping it simple, all I can say is that it is fantastic - and it works just as well here. The world map allows you to choose how you go about fighting enemies (mainly based on their level). The 'popcorn' strategy from [i]Desktop Dungeons[/i] translates quite well. There are shops and various places to visit that add to the strategy. There are meta-game upgrades, and that is cool. You can have multiple accounts, so no need for your significant other to buy it too. Nice addition.\n\nIt is [i]definitely[/i] addicting in the sense that you want to constantly do another run because 1) you learned how to build a better deck, and 2) you now have earned more starting power via meta-game upgrades.\n\nSounds great? Yeah, it does and it is. [b]There is a major 'con', though - the overall polish and artwork.[/b] And don't get it twisted - I don't care two-cents about graphics (I just came from playing [i]NetHack 3.6.0[/i] an hour ago). This is about the [i]quality[/i] and care that was put into the artwork. Even if you are not a career artist, you can make things nice. This game does not do that. There is no style, and it shows in spades. The music is utterly forgettable. The controls are 'meh'. You can't use the keypad or keyboard to move as far as I have tried. The mouse is what you are stuck with (but you need the keyboard to enter an account name).\n\n[b]To add insult to injury, this was ported from mobile and it was done poorly. There are black bars on my screen. C'mon.[/b]\n\nBut at the end of the day, I think the mechanic works really well and [i]just barely[/i] justifies a positive review.\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n+The mix of the two mechanics works really well (although neither is unique, and both have been done exactly the same before in other games)\n+Definitely has that 'one-more-run' appeal, specifically driven by meta-game upgrades\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n-The artwork investment standard couldn't be lower; this is the lowest point and actually puts me on the fence for a negative review\n-Generic music\n-Decidedly few options for controls, but what do you expect from a mobile port\n-Black bars on my screen\n-Apparently the mobile version is like four bucks; once again the PC market is taxed\n\n[b]It is fun, there is no denying that - and that's why it gets my vote BUT I do find it difficult to reward the lacklustre attempt at art and a poor mobile port.[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1490445116, "timestamp_updated": 1490445612, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.758520", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30505620": {"recommendationid": "30505620", "author": {"steamid": "76561198243273126", "num_games_owned": 9, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1730, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495012952}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5f88\u597d\u73a9\uff0c\u4e0d\u8fc7\u968f\u673a\u6027\u592a\u5f3a\u4e86\uff0c\u9ad8\u96be\u5ea6\u4e0b\u4e0d\u62ff\u5230\u67d0\u4e9b\u5361\u724cCOMBO\u5c31\u6ca1\u6cd5\u901a\u5173\u3002\u800c\u62ff\u5230COMBO\u7684\u6982\u7387\u5b8c\u5168\u770b\u8fd0\u6c14\u3002\n\u5e0c\u671b\u767b\u5f55STEAM\u4ee5\u540e\u80fd\u51faDLC", "timestamp_created": 1489490097, "timestamp_updated": 1489490097, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30286491": {"recommendationid": "30286491", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007748381", "num_games_owned": 215, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 2936, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509036761}, "language": "english", "review": "Don't judge a book by it's cover, here's a game that has 100% positive reviews as of today and Richard Garfield's seal of approval.

I can't speak to the technical quality of this release, but I am very familiar with the gameplay.  I bought this game here to support the developer and to preach the virtues of Dream Quest to the benighted Steam masses.\n\nDream Quest is the best rogue-like* I've ever played, and my favorite single-player game of all time.  I know this might be hard to believe, given the screenshots, but lurking behind those stilted stick figures is a game of exceptional ingenuity.\n\nTo boil Dream Quest down to its most basic, you select a character class and start with a deck of ~10 cards, most of which are attack cards that simply deal damage, like Attack 1.  You wander around a level fighting monsters in a series of card battles, gaining experience and gold with which you improve your deck.  At the end of each level, there's a boss, and if you manage to defeat the third-floor boss, you face a final boss that's much, much harder than anything that came before.  Individual runs take perhaps 45 minutes at the very most, though most will end much sooner than that.\n\nThe cards fall into a few basic categories.  Attack cards mostly just deal damage (sometimes of different kinds), but occasionally have other effects, like increasing the damage of future attacks or giving you a defensive buff for a turn.  Action cards do various things, and at the start of the game you're restricted to playing one per turn (this feels like it was pulled straight out of Dominion--Swiftness, for instance, is a straight-up Village clone).  Spells are like actions, broadly speaking, but they require MP to use instead of actions.  Mana cards provide the mana to cast your spells \n(sometimes with other neat effects).  Equipment cards stay out and have passive effects once played, and later in the game you can get equipment slots so that you start with them in play.  Reaction cards trigger from your hand and have some effect--for instance, if the enemy plays an attack card and you have Riposte in your hand, it cancels the attack, deals 2 damage to the attacker, and replaces itself.  It's also possible to get curses (usually just temporarily), which, in another apparent Dominion nod, are just blank cards.\n\nEach turn, you play/discard as many cards as you can/wish to, then draw up to your max hand size.  In the early game, you will almost always just play all your cards, but later in the game there are more in-combat choices.\n\nWhat's amazing about Dream Quest is the way seemingly simple mechanics unspool into one of the most varied games I've ever played.  Enemies, which are just piles of cards and HP with perhaps a passive ability, all present different and interesting obstacles.  Zombies bite you and doom you to die five turns later--better be able to kill them fast enough.  Water elementals slowly reduce your hand size.  Sphinxes forbid you from playing the most common card type in your hand, forcing you to build awkward hands in order to do anything.  This enemy variety is even more pronounced among the bosses, who all have interesting gimmicks and require different deck-building and play priorities.  The Phoenix, for example, turns into an egg for a turn when it dies, and is only truly defeated when you smash the egg; you therefore want to set up the turn where you kill the Phoenix to deal as much damage to the egg as possible.  The Gelatinous Cube slowly eats the cards of your deck, so reliance on just one card to deal damage could doom you.  Different fights feel remarkably different, especially once you get to know the contents of enemy decks and can play around them a bit.\n\nPlayer characters are even more varied.  Character classes have different starting decks, cards presented for purchase/level up, and activated abilities, so it's no surprise that they play very differently from one another.  What's almost shocking is how much variety exists within each class, and how seemingly weak cards can become essential to decks.  There are numerous cards I've written off as unplayable that have turned into deck MVPs, and even after a year and a half of play I'm finding new clever interactions.  To me, this is the chief draw of Dream Quest: decks end up playing wildly differently, and can all still succeed.\n\nDream Quest is a hard game, but the limited length of the runs means that death is no great loss, and the difficulty makes victory satisfying.  But Dream Quest also has a very clever system for cheating death: each run earns you points (with the effective maximum being a very rare ~2k), and when you die you can spend 500 points to restart from your last level-up.  This price doubles each time you resurrect a character, so you can mitigate BS bad luck or undo a mistake a couple times, but it rapidly becomes too expensive to respawn.\n\nThese points can also be spent to unlock things you otherwise gain via in-game achievements, which is another quietly ingenious system.  There's a lot to unlock, including 10 classes and 50 cards.  I generally have mixed feelings about unlocks--they often feel like pointless content gating--but in this case, the game is satisfying without unlocks, and it offers you a means to bypass them through general play.\n\nI have literally never played this game with sound.  The graphics are obviously poor.  The writing in the game is without exception powerfully goofy.  If these things are important, Dream Quest is probably not for you.\n\nSo who is Dream Quest for?

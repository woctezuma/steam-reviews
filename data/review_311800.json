It's like borderlands or diablo mixed with neon aestetics and rad music. It is not yet completely done and polished, there are some slightly unbalanced things here and there, but I think for what it is right now, it's already playable and is really enjoyable once you get into it.\n\nBut I must say that the only problem that Black Ice has is that it gets pretty repetitive over time, which might make some people bored. Hack the server, kill enemies, get loot, equip loot, sell loot, repeat. There is no story (yet) and no real objectives besides getting to higher and higher levels by grinding and defeating the main server. Hopefully that will be changed once the game is actually finished.\n\nNonetheless, I can see the potential in it. It's fun to kill some time in it as you get almost dragged into the game. An ability to customize your layout and your playstyle however you want is something that makes it replayable and interesting. The aestetics and just the way it looks makes for nice screenshots and atmosphere. It is truly a hidden gem of steam.

It may not be for everyone, but personally I think the double jumping and teleporting feels fluid and fun and gives you a lot of options to dodge and strafe in combat\n- The music is great\n- It's visually appealing\n- There are still frequent updates and the dev is very active!\n- Along with that, everything is free once you've bought the game\n- Though there isn't anything really in the way of a plot yet, I have no doubt that it will make the game even more engaging\n\nCons:\n- If repetition isn't your thing, this may not be the game for you, as there are not many types of enemies and (currently) when you save and quit, your inventory and stats are saved but the world is not, so while you always have a way to get more experience, your progress in the world itself will be reset every time (though after a certain point there aren't really barriers to getting around, other than your level)\n- I have high hopes for the eventual plot, but as it stands right now, let's face it: there isn't one. If plot-based games appeal to you, it may be a safer bet to wait and see what this holds\n- While there is multiplayer, it's almost always empty or any servers up are private\n- Gold seems incredibly useful at first, but after a short while you will have more than you could ever need and nothing to spend it on (yet?)\n- For some reason there is a (seemingly arbitrary) cap on getting perks and talent points - you can only have 3 perks (which have various effects in specific situations), some of which aren't very useful, and you only get talent points (which improve your various abilities) up until you're lvl 50. While there may be a good reason for the limit, it currently just makes me wary about putting talent points into anything in the event that I regret it - they cannot be refunded once you've locked them in, and as said before, they're limited\n\nIn terms of the actual gameplay I would liken it somewhat to the Borderlands series - there is an emphasis on swapping your weapons out for better ones regularly, to customize your inventory according to what playstyles you enjoy, and the randomization means you may have to make a few tough decisions based on flat-out damage versus useful side benefits.\nOverall, the graphics, gameplay, and music combine to make Black Ice - in my opinion - a game more than worthy of its price and your time. And if you're not convinced, play the demo!

You just have to start a new character.\n\nOverall I give this game a 7/10. There just doesn't feel like there is much purpose yet beyond loot grinding without the upcoming quest system.

Doesn't even have to be like defined sets, gear could spawn with a random set prefix and wearing 2 or more could apply some small bonus. \n\nWhy does my character stop getting points at level 50? I want to customize his/her growth aside from hoping for lucky drops from gear. What about a prestige system or something? Where maybe you can reset at some level and maintain some portion of your talents or the talent point cap for you new char is raised etc etc. Just something more than gear. Right now all you need is money and gear. Money buys gear but it's good for nothing else (except for maybe making you sad if you die and see millions of gold taken for dying).

After that, add this game to your \"Following\" list. The developer has got a good thing going here, and I hope the game and its following continues to grow. But as of now I cannot recommend buying this game.\n\nSo let's get straight to the point. The biggest, scariest, most crippling flaw of this game is the limited content. The gameplay is beyond repetitive, the world gets old fast, and the game lacks any sort of direction or motivation. Remember the demo, you played it up to level 4? Unfortunately, the paid game is the exact same as the demo. There is no plot, the enemies stay the same, the weapons hardly change, it's literally just like playing the demo over and over again for hours on end. At the time of typing this I've logged about 5 hours, and the game has been pretty much the same for every moment of it. There IS some sort of \"final boss\", Finality Inc, but there's really no motivation to shoot for it and complete the game when the final boss is really just a higher-level version of the tutorial server. \n\nThis should be fine, though. The game IS in early access. It's not supposed to be complete. But what concerns me is how close it appears to be to completion. The game is in beta 8.0, meaning the game may have only two more major updates until the full release. The developer has also stated that he will slowly increase the price of the game as it continues development until the game launches at a final price of $20, and the game is already sitting at $15. I feel this game should be sitting firmly in the pre-alpha state, not an update or two from launch. I'd love to see this game grow, but I fear the game will cut development short before it can achieve its real potential. As a result, I sadly can't recommend early access fans invest in it. \n\nIf you feel like supporting a nice indie game company and have some cash to blow, go right on ahead.

While it may seem simple and boring at first (as some may have pointed out), the game has come a long way. Now you get to experience a multitude of weapons, anything from TRON like discs to a rainbow laser beam to little cyber-creatures you can summon. The game is in development, so you can bet the creator (Garett Cooper) is always adding new content. The game is a one of a kind, featuring a hack and slash-esque gameplay with a Quake-ish feel and a cyberpunk twist. Props to you for being original, Garett. I recommend this game to anyone who's feeling bored and wants to try something new. It's a nice, unique casual game that anyone can enjoy.\n------------------------------------------------------------\nTL;DR\n\nThe game is worth the $15, and doesn't get old quick.

The servers have levels starting with 1 and going up to 100 (I think). Higher levels yield stronger enemies and stronger loot, so you can go at your own pace. Also, there are a lot of weapons such as laser beams, freeze beams, flying discs, mines, bouncy balls, and various others. \n\nI also love that you can play the game within 5 seconds of loading up the game, without having to wait for all these other logos and disclaimers being shown first. I also noticed the dev is always taking suggestions and improving the game as much as possible. The dev is always adding new content and new ideas to make the game more interesting. I'm starting to regret buying this game on sale now, instead of paying full price for it. It's definitely worth the full price.\n\nDon't play if you're looking for a story (there isn't one, from what I can tell, but I don't think the game needs one) or if you're looking for a \"Call of Battlefield\" type game. Supposedly the game has PVP but I never tried it, and don't know if anyone else plays online. However, this game satisfies what I was looking for when I want to just hop onto a game and shoot some things.

Although development has been slow I'm certain things will pick up soon with the formation of a company bakcing the game now.\n\nThe developer Garret Cooper is very responsive to the community and listens to feedback and suggestions so get involved!\n\nAnyways, endorsements aside...\nBlack Ice is a rather addictive first person shooter set in the retro-futuristic cyberspace everyone dreamed of in 1990. It's ice or be iced baby and getting iced ain't cool!\n\nThe gameplay is open ended and grindy with no real direction other than \"hack servers and destroy the Black Ice\".\nI guess the one true goal is to hack Finality Incorporated which starts out at LVL100. A pretty intimidating goal that gets closer as you level and grind. Everything is blanced and well rounded with the pace of the game ultimately being decided by YOU, the player.\n\nThe world consists of wireframes and grids that are occasionaly broken up by the jagged landscape that dips and climbs above the otherwise level plain. The \"servers\" that are littered throughout the netscape are the only major deviations from the rolling plains other than the aforementioned hills. Servers are geometric buildings that dot the land farther than the eye can see (well maybe as far as your render distance is set). \n\nHacking servers is pretty simple. You equip your icebreaker to your hotbar and activate it by either pressing the button assigned to the slot you put it in or the quick deploy button (Q). Once you activate your icebreaker on a server a circular area will appear that you have to stay inside for a short amount of time (determined by your icebreaker's stats and your character's skils) until the server is hacked. Enemies will spawn while you are hacking and you must eliminate all of them to complete the hack. The higher a server's level the harder the enemies and the better the rerwards.\n\nOnce hacked, a server will drop some sweet loot and net you a good chunk of XP. As for the loot that isn't so sweet, you can just huck that junk to a vendor to earn some bitcreds. Once you've got some bitcreds you can buy better gear from the various stores littered about, which are identifiable by a giant $ floating over their server along with the obscenely solid neon colors.\n\nThe multiplayer is there but I hardly ever bother with it due to the lack of interactivity between players. You get no reward for assisting them and the community is rather silent in person. There honestly isn't much to do with other players. Although it is nice to see the ocasional Pacman ghost float by on a mass murder spree.\n\nAll in all I love the game. I love every little thing that has changed or that has been added in.\n\nI hope to see the hardwork continue on this gem of a game!", "timestamp_created": 1469604322, "timestamp_updated": 1469604322, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.459912", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "24325003": {"recommendationid": "24325003", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061846146", "num_games_owned": 5, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 430, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1469474966}, "language": "english", "review": "I really enjoy this game.

What can I say about this game?  For starters, it's a great game just to fuck around in.

Well, it's this-- you ever want to kill a spider in your house with a laser but couldn't get your national Government to give you the funds to research and produce a laser that could kill that spider?  Have you ever thought a flying/hovering shark that flung fireballs at you would be a cool thing?  What about neon colored everything? \n\nBlack Ice has all that and more.  Think the randomized gazillions of loot of Borderlands, the action-rpg feel of Diablo and the trippy neon-grid of TRON all had a three-some and somehow all gave birth at once to this game.  You go around hacking systems and killing off bots that appear to prevent you from stealing the precious data from those systems.  Wanna shoot rainbow stars at a giant Scorpion?  Go ahead!

This game has a lot of potential, like many early access games do.  But as it stands, I'm not gonna recommend it.  Why?  Because all it really has is potential.  Potential, and a lot of circle-strafing.\n\nI can see so many ways this could go that would add depth to the game.  Servers could spawn out terrain chunks or static defenses or semi-random combat puzzle elements.  Hacking tools could provide weird options and recontexualization of combat, like letting you set up warp gates or turn off gravity Matrix-Style, or trade the ability to escape for faster hacking time or something.  Your weapons and programs could let you lock down enemies, subvert control of enemy ICE, or maybe even force a swarm of those little crawlers to merge into a big boss that's paradoxically easier to fight.  Hell, maybe a weapon that targets an enemy, and instead of shooting them, it spawns little target points around it, and does massive damage when you hit all of those.  Challenge vs damage output sorta thing. These are just ideas off the top of my head, mind you, and I'm sure the creator has more than a few of them in mind already.\n\nBut none of these things are in it.  Instead, it's just a shooter where the only real way to fight is circle around and shoot anything that moves.  It's a bit like Doom, if Doom took place on a flat open space, and your guns didn't feel like Thor punching through drywall.  Moving feels clunky when you get stuck on enemies.  Which is bizarre, since there's no other things to get stuck on.  The whole game feels like that.  Empty.  Waiting for something to happen.\n\nAnd I really do want something to happen.  I paid for this game because I love where it could go.  But right now?  Right now, I wouldn't tell my friends to buy this.\n\nI'll revisit this review in a few months, and at least after the full version comes out.  I know a lot will be added and updated.

You jump into a procedurally generated \"city\" of servers (resemble buildings) and must hack them while defending yourself from the various enemies it spawns. Higher level servers will throw more and deadlier enemies at you, but will offer more experience and better rewards. As you level up, you earn point that you can spend on \"Talents\", which offer a variety of permanent passive bonuses (health, damage, rare loot chance, etc). There are also a myriad of procedurally generated weapons and assorted \"pets\" (AI drones) that you can summon to fight for you, each with various bonuses and strengths.\n\nFor weapons, there is everything from basic shotguns and machine guns to railguns, beam cannons, disco balls, and TRON-style throwing discs (which return to you like a boomerang). Each of these procedurally generated wepaons can feature all sorts of properties, including drunk-flight, piercing, freeze, slow, burn, zigzag, richochet, explosion (area of effect), bounce, knockback, and more. Want an explosive rocket machinegun with bouncy shots that \"colorizes\" anything it hits? How about a railgun that pierces through ANYTHING ('buildings' included) that freezes enemies solid? THese and more are just a taste of some of the crazy weapons you will acquire.\n\nVisually, the game has a very Tron-style presentation, with intense neon lighting and a hewalthy amount of bloom. It makes for a visual festival while battling AI minions as they explode into a shower of lights and particles. I also find it easy to spot and track enemies due to the contrast provided by the \"neon wireframe\" graphics style.\n\nAudio seems to be retro styled, although I feel that this fits the game perfectly. Lasers and bolts have that distinctive \"pew pew\" to them, while wepaons with explosive properties leave a satisfying boom on impact. Also, the music is catchy, and I often find myself inadvertantly bobbing my head in rythm to the combat tracks. Also, if you find the 'miniboss'. the music shifts to a track that, in all honesty, gave me shivers the first time I heard it (before he obliterated me).\n\nThis is a fantastic game that shows great promise. The developer has been making frequent updates, and also has a separate \"in development\" branch available (in Betas), with some significant changes to both gameplay and the overall interface (including rebinding all controls).

Like they say, the loot is a lot like borderlands. Seemingly endless build possibilities, quick leveling, and interesting gear make an otherwise monotonous game fun. I say monotonous because at this time there is really no story line or goals (besides taking down corporations). So if you love a grind that stays fairly interesting and challenging (via a very useful difficulty slider) you will probably like this game. Add to all that the fact that since it is a pretty simple game graphically it runs very smoothly. I can't wait to see what features are added in the near future.

It is playable, stable, and already got something to do. You can, even in the current state, adjust your Avatar: More Weapons? Fill your slots with unique, randomized weapons! Or do you prefer using daemons doing the dirty work for you? Load your deck full with minionprograms.\n\nSuggestions:\n-A story mode, some quests, hidden hints. \nMore hazards in Cyberspace - as far as I know, there is one AI (the shark) flying around and trys to fry you if you pull a Wilson, but nothing more. \n\n-Implement flatlines (Neuromancer fans might remember good ol' Dixie!)\n\n-Temporary effects: If you are taking too much damage in a short period of time or if you are hit by a special program/enemy, your vision might blur or your control bugs around until you load a specific program.\n\n-\"dungeons\": Big servers, big cash.

And this is why I like it. If you wanna skip the lengthy part of my review and wanna go straight to the pros and cons, you can find them below.\n\nLet's start, shall we?\nAlthough this is an early access game, I bought it. I rarely ever buy early access games and to be frank, it looked boring as hell on the screenshots. But after reading so many positive reviews and watching a video provided by the dev I wanted to try it for myself. So, what is it about?\n\nWell, you're a hacker and you move in a virtual city (you could probably guess from all the wireframe yourself). That city is full of corporations you gott hack in order to level up your mad skillz. Your ultimate goal is to hack the biggest company in town, Finality Corp. This is not only the biggest building but also the most difficult to hack. So your primary objective is to hack as many buildings as you can to level up, get stronger and ultimately face the big-ass cybershark, the end boss and dangerous protection software of Finality Corp.\n\nSo, how does the hacking work? You stand in front of a building and press either H or 1 on your keyboard (default controls). Then the hack will begin. Upon hacking enemies will spawn. The higher the skill level required to hack something, the longer the hack will take and the stronger the enemies will be. You get XP by successfully hacking a company's building and defeating the enemies. Be careful though, because as soon as the hack starts, you will be forced to move in a limited area of the hack. Leaving that area causes the hack to be cancelled.\nUpon successfully hacking a building, it will get transparent and you will get loot which you can incorporate into your software to get stronger. The loot that drops is based on your own level.  Also, better hacking devices mean better hacking, keep that in mind.\n\nWhat kind of loot is there?\nA lot. There is a whole bunch of weapons, from machine guns to shotguns, sniper rifles, ice blasts, fire balls, rainbowlasers, laser beam weapons, bombs and so on and so forth. It looks all pretty cool tbh. Then there are minions you can conjure to help you out, additional malware, so to speak. And also there are better hacking devices for you to pick up and a lot of other stuff. A lot of the items will give you passive bonuses on your stats and effectively boost your mad skillz.\n\nWhat can you do with all the loot you don't need? Visit a shop! In a shop, you can sell your unwanted loot for bitcreds and buy better items with bitcreds. But I gotta say, after an hour of playing you'll acquire so many bitcreds that you can buy almost anything in a shop which means the stuff could be a bit more balanced imo. Also, enemies do not drop loot, they only give XP.\n\nSpeaking of enemies, what types of enemies are there?\nWell, there are a few. Stationary towers, a lot of moving enemies, little spiders, big boss spiders, enemies with and without cannons, shields and lasers, scorpions and the like. Looks pretty cool but the enemies lack a bit of variety, there aren't all that many in the game as it is right now.\nLuckily there is a ton of different weapons and skills to defeat them with. The only gripe I've got with it though is the fact that the game's got no weapons models which means you won't see your super cool laser cannon but that's okay I guess.\n\nThe game's got other neat details though.\nFor instance: When you walk up to a company's building you can look for its entrance door and click on it. This door will give you some info on the company you are about to hack and to be honest, it's humorous and I like it. You can also find that humour with a lot of items, for example the \"Ghost In The Shellfish\"-minion or the \"Downloadable RAM\"-upgrade. It's pretty nice and it made me smile more than once. Good job.\n\nFrom the technical side of things the game runs well without any performance issues. The only issue being that things can get extremely bright and you will get eye cancer after a few hours of playing. Also some very bright spots can prevent you from seeing the last enemy to defeat to end the hack.\n\nAnd what other game mechanics does this game have?\nWell, you can shoot, walk, run, sprint, jump, use a jetpack to fly, teleport a few meters away and most importantly: hack. \nBut be careful, because everything you do will cost you RAM. You can increase your RAM by leveling up and assigning skill points or by items which give passive bonuses. A jetpack, for instance, needs to heat up which costs a bunch of RAM and the flying itself also costs a big bunch of RAM. And when you're completely out of RAM you cannot jump, fly or shoot or even hack. So keep an eye on your RAM meter.\n\nTo wrap this up, what are the pros and cons of the game?\n\n+ Huge, open world with the option of an ever generating world, making the game endless\n+ Flashy and colourful visuals and nice reflections\n+ Big variety of weapons to choose from\n+ Cool soundtrack\n+ Great character stat customization and fast leveling up\n+ Great challenge with higher tier hacks\n+ A big bunch of cool upgrades for you to use\n+ Achievements to go after\n+ Nice humour and little details in the game as well as a couple of funny references\n+ Bunch of loot\n+ A nice dev\n+ Highly addictive gameplay\n\n- Lacking enemy variety\n- Danger of eye cancer (srsly, dat shizz is BRIGHT)\n- No visible weapon models\n- The amount of bitcreds you get is unproportional to the amount of useful things in the shops or: too much creds\n- Although the colours are nice, the game's look can get pretty monotonous\n- As soon as you approach Finality Corp. the boss will spawn so you can't hack anything near that building\n- The amount of possible songs playing during combat is a bit small\n- The uge world can get demotivating, even on the lowest setting\n- No story (can be a good thing or a bad thing, for me it is a con)\n\nAnd, finally, what I'd like to see in the game:\n\n* Fixing all the cons I just listed\n* To have your very own house or company in the world as a base of operations where you can store your inventory and which you can decorate and such\n* That hacked companies don't get transparent but instead get added to your company, changing colour rather than getting transparent\n* Optional colour filters for the game to change up the look a bit (for instance a filter that paints all the black squares rainbow-ish with flashing colours and the like)\n* A couple new game modes, for instance a survival mode or an arcade mode where you hack only one building but it takes longer with each level and such (or something that has something to do with music and flashing colours)\n* Visible and customizable player model when going to your inventory and/or your base of operations as mentioned above\n* You can equip two weapons at a time, would be cool if the right-click weapon was right and the left-click-weapon was left, I am currently shooting with two lasguns and it's kinda disappointing to only have one beam\n* Make the city more alive with visible data streams and little critters running around or even NPC players doing stuff, combine this with the idea of houses you can go in and the shops and such will get more awesome\n\nI guess I could rant on and on of what kind of stuff I'd like to see in the game if I just thought about it hard enough but I guess I'll stop now. \nSo, that's it.\n\nWould I recommend this game? Absolutely.\nAt 10 bucks? You bet! It can get highly addictive and is a bunch of fun, even in this early state. There is a lot of room for improvement but the way I see it, the dev will sort that out.", "timestamp_created": 1422273872, "timestamp_updated": 1422274146, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.616168", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "14087614": {"recommendationid": "14087614", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073306751", "num_games_owned": 291, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 352, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490540509}, "language": "english", "review": "Another damn good rogue-esque rpg, A cool/colorful First-Person Shooter mixed with a weird 1980s cyberworld rogue.

Multiplayer is a blast! Tag teaming servers that are far above both of you and somehow comming out on top feels like youve just co-op'd the 300.\n First time i ever hacked a swarm server and saw enemies just pouring over the top of the building i was after actually made me challenge my spray and pray strategy for a moment. I ended up having to turn and bolt as they overtook me. Dropping a mine as i fell back, it smeared those foremost to me that were already full of holes, and bruised up the ones i hadnt tagged yet. After disappearing behind a red building in my hack range, i patiently popped heals and jumped back out, only to come face to face with a lot of digital spiders and some creepy flying monoliths. I Sprinted right past them, turning and blasting as I dropped the speed increase, shotgun and machine gun blasting away and chewing up their digital pixels like candy. They didnt even touch me. Backpeddaling and sighting in on the monoliths as the last of the spiders disappeared, i strafed left to right, dodging what they throw at me as theyve been consistently tagging me the whole time. Near death, I pop heals again, barely saving myself from the Game Over screen. Behind another building i see that only one remains. A quick pop out and he blows into pixels. Yay me :)\nAnyway,that was an epic fight. Ive had plenty of those, even considering the games whopping 2 different enemy types.

With every update the game seems to be improving in the right direction, and while it could still be awhile from the finished product it is worth supporting and playing right now.", "timestamp_created": 1405325117, "timestamp_updated": 1499695855, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.577865", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "11224190": {"recommendationid": "11224190", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088903015", "num_games_owned": 117, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 1370, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507793855}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing Game Great Graphics Nice Community", "timestamp_created": 1405296192, "timestamp_updated": 1405296192, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "11200332": {"recommendationid": "11200332", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032614898", "num_games_owned": 143, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 6840, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502944335}, "language": "english", "review": "Omg i became a huge fan of this game the moment i got the demo. bought it for a friend even. this game is nothing but awesomeness. i hope the guy adds actual like... character bodies for multiplayer. as of now we're all giant blue pills haha. i recommend this game highly.", "timestamp_created": 1405175922, "timestamp_updated": 1405175922, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.452373", "comment_count": "16", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "11187305": {"recommendationid": "11187305", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078974127", "num_games_owned": 43, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 400, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1407378312}, "language": "english", "review": "very fun and addictive,  you will constantly be testing yourself to see how high of a level server you can hack and how high you can get your DPS", "timestamp_created": 1405105580, "timestamp_updated": 1405105580, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500208", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "11178000": {"recommendationid": "11178000", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995188854", "num_games_owned": 160, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 550, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509433157}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is sp amazing.

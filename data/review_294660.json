It was forty minutes that just disppeared into the void. I'll never get them back but at least I won't have a TERRIBLE game to thank for losing that time. Just a... meh game.\n\nPutt Putt Saves the Zoo is a meh game. I'd say the first two were pretty lazily constructed, and while Putt Putt continues to be Humongous' lazier titles (with only a single variation of animals you need to find and objects required to rescue them) this particular installmant is... fine. It didn't totally suck. But I wouldn't consider that an achievement.\n\nThe story of Putt Putt Saves the Zoo is... an inefficient zoo owner on the opening day of his zoo realizes he lost the baby animals at the various exhibits and requires a small child to help find and rescue them. Wouldn't that be at the top of your priorities ESPECIALLY on opening day? But, as you'd expect, Putt Putt has to get deep into the \"dangers\" of the zoo and save all the poor, lost, and stupid animals.\n\nThe characters in this game are so stupid. I mean, yeah, Smokey left a massive lever that activated a rocket that could take you to the F***ING MOON in the last game, but these characters are just f***ing incompetent. Outback Al is a joke of a zookeeper, if he seriously is relying on Putt Putt to find his lost animals. An elephant is afraid of a mouse (Ha ha), and a seal simply cannot waddle back to its own habitat because- you know- seals can only transport themselves by swimming. It just makes you wonder how these baby animals got stuck in the first place. The mouse I can get, but how do you wander so far away from your habitat that you end up on an icy lake in the middle of the Polar Exhibit? Maybe the kids were out having some drinks the night before and got lost on their way back home. All 6 of them. That seems likely. \n\nThe game's the same as the last two Putt Putt games. Click on sh** and then sh** happens. The puzzles are easy. The story is bland. But the overall aesthetic of the game is a lot nicer now. The game doesn't have that awkward pixely look from the last two games (along with the crappy animations that came with it) but now it's hand-drawn like Freddi Fish first was and it looks... pretty good. Barring some weird texture glitches and some terrible TERRIBLE water. But beyond that the game looks pretty good.\n\nPutt Putt Saves the Zoo is just like the last two. If you've got a kid with a short attention span because they're like 3, I'm sure they'll enjoy this. But beyond that Putt Putt Saves the Zoo is just safe. There isn't anything spectacularly bad or notable in this game. It's a big forgettable grey blob of meh.

But I was solely disappointed.\nNot only can you not drive in this game, but you can not do burnouts OR skids. You are a deranged car with a mouth and eyes with a dog in the back. \n\nYou click on areas and your flamboyant car drives to that location in the most UNCOOL way ever. The car spins like its made of jello then flies to the direction with a dumb smile on its face. The voice actor for this car is also extremely annoying, I turned off the sound and tried putting on subtitles but I couldnt find how to do it so I guess these developers hate deaf people and dont want them playing their garbage racing game where you cant even race.\n\nSo you might be asking \"Well it has cars in it, what type of racing game is it?\"\nI'll tell you: None. It's not a racing game at all! The racing is replaced with click movement, the power-ups is replaced with an inventory. The inventory, you ask? Well it is basically like the trunk of the car, but since the car doesn't have a driver (which makes no damn sense) he has to have hooks installed so that he grabs stuff. Why not just have a driver? The incompetent writing doesn't stop there though. \n\nNot only is there no action, or subtle sexual undertones; but there is also no words to describe how bad this game is.\n\nThe only people that would like this game are fat losers, because theyve got fat loser trucks in the game too.\nNot one relatable character. I searched high and low for a sick army truck with slicked back hair or even a surfer truck but NOTHING relatable to their core gaming audience was even found.\n\nFinal Score: I give this game 3 out of 10 brooms.

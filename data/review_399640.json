The game is like a mishmash of most of the popular roguelites of the past few years, it has an over world structured like FTLs, a skill system based on cooldowns like Risk of Rain, and a combat system similar to Binding of Issac. Runs of the game typically take twenty minutes to complete (faster if ur gud probably) and the game is very fair, every attack is projected and projectile speeds are slow so if you are good you shouldn't take much damage. There are also many ways to specialise and differentate your characters run to run as each character has a weapon, a race and racial ability, 2 spells, a god they can recieve blessing from, armor sets they can complete that give abilities, an active item, and any number of small stat items that can be acquired to power them up. There are a few builds that are IMO pretty broken (maxing attack speed with a ranged weapon with poison and stun Kreygasm) but if you play the game with random spell and race builds (as it is supposed to be played) it can be pretty challenging and wierd.\n\nStrengths of the game\n-Very easy to get the hang of and very fair\n-Strong item pool and many opportunities to buy items. You can go in with a build in mind and make it relatively easily not like in BOI where getting some specific item you want is rng most of the time.\n-Many ways to diversify and specialise characters thanks to god blessings, armor sets, and large number of items per shop\n-Good game feel, most items and abilities feel useful and viable in certain builds. Rooms can also be cleared relatively quickly\n\n\nWeaknesses of the Game\n-Lack of post game content compared to other games. Took me 20 hours to learn enough, kill all the bosses, and unlock most items and characters. Compared to BOI or Enter the Gungeon it had less content. It has about the same amount of content and replayability of Risk of Rain I'd say.\n-3 of the gods blessings feel underpowered but are still ok.\n-Ranged weapons are strictly worse than melee weapons, there is no real tradeoff since there is no ammo in the game and I don't think melee weapons extra abilities are better than the kiting potential of ranged weapons. I could just be a scrub tho.\n-I don't like the art style :p\n\nAll of these are really minor gripes though. Overall this game feels really well put together.

What's really nice about this is how well balanced and equally important these two parts are. Knowing where to go, what to spend your money on, what abilities to upgrade first and which of the 5 available gods you devote yourself to is equally as important as being able to land your abilities and dodge projectiles.\n\nI've seen people compare this game's combat to MOBAs and I can kinda see why. Your character has stats that are fairly standard for this genre like movement speed, attack speed/damage, ability power and cooldown reduction. You also have 4 abilities that are on a short cooldown and a weapon (that would correspond to your auto-attack although you do have to mash the attack key in order to keep attacking).\n\nYou can either build the character yourself, picking the race, weapon and all the abilities if you wanna go for some fancy synergies or you can let the game give you a randomized character to play with. What kinda bothers me is that when you make a custom character, you only get half of \"Spirit\" which is the currency that unlocks new races, abilities and weapons so the custom runs kinda feel like a waste of your time in this regard.\n\nWhat I also love about the game is how ridiculously overpowered you can get and how this is not really dependent on your luck (well...at least not entirely). You see, there is no single overpowered item that will catapult your run to greatness like Brimstone or Polyphemus in Isaac. In Flamebreak, if you want to get powerful, you need to make good decisions consistently and plan ahead.\n\nLast but not least, the game also has 3 versions of daily runs with separate leaderboards, which I find kinda questionable because very few people play these in the first place but I play them all every day regardless.\n\nOverall I would totally recommend Flamebreak to anyone who's been itching for a new rogue-lite game since even though it does borrow some heavy inspiration from other titles, it is very well polished and executed.", "timestamp_created": 1499464901, "timestamp_updated": 1499464954, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.619373", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33216846": {"recommendationid": "33216846", "author": {"steamid": "76561198334478043", "num_games_owned": 30, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 196, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502205140}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6211\u662f\u8ddf\u7740\u8001\u83ca\u559c+1\u7684", "timestamp_created": 1499147945, "timestamp_updated": 1499147945, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33183102": {"recommendationid": "33183102", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997197349", "num_games_owned": 862, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 698, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499438932}, "language": "english", "review": "I didn't think I was going to like this when I first started but once you start to get used to the itemization it becomes a lot of fun.

It is a very challenging game especially if, like me, you have never played this type of game before.", "timestamp_created": 1476540146, "timestamp_updated": 1476540146, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26002486": {"recommendationid": "26002486", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118388793", "num_games_owned": 78, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 3177, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477071120}, "language": "english", "review": "Great roguelike, very addicting, very underrated too", "timestamp_created": 1476299533, "timestamp_updated": 1476299533, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.467980", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25970683": {"recommendationid": "25970683", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044179720", "num_games_owned": 153, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 47, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1465871319}, "language": "german", "review": "not too bad arpg like action but no autosave even after bosses and rather hard gameplay is too negative sorry !", "timestamp_created": 1476125101, "timestamp_updated": 1476125101, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.466667", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25920108": {"recommendationid": "25920108", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991825293", "num_games_owned": 56, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2580, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499958580}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantastic.", "timestamp_created": 1475914602, "timestamp_updated": 1475914602, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25653352": {"recommendationid": "25653352", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059354295", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3315, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495468005}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantastic game!

You do have the option to purchase additional skills if they appear at a shop in addition to new items, weapons, and armor that boost your stats.\n\nPlease note that this game is not a MOBA so please don\u2019t buy it expecting it to be one.\n\nThe graphics are pleasant and combined with an amazing soundtrack help to immerse you in the world - the switch from the overworlds music to combat music upon entering a new level helps to get your adrenaline flowing.  \n\nThe game is very challenging once you start playing on Hard or Nightmare difficulties (the fairy quest challenge in particular was insanely difficult) although Normal will still present a good challenge for new players.

Sometimes there will be more powerful versions of basic enemies in an encounter. \n\nOne of the games biggest strengths is that every time you are handed a procedurally generated encounter, the terrain and variety of enemies means that the encounter is a new challenge. This, combined with your character having a basic attack and three abilities all chosen randomly, is what makes the game so much fun to play again and again.", "timestamp_created": 1470490404, "timestamp_updated": 1470490404, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500713", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24709982": {"recommendationid": "24709982", "author": {"steamid": "76561197965296062", "num_games_owned": 258, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 1698, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509587340}, "language": "english", "review": "Binding of Isaac meets FLT.\n\n9/10\n\nPro:\n-quick, precise and fair skill based combat\n-solid graphics\n-tactical map matters (FTL style map, but better)\n-very polished\n-Set Items with sweet bonusses\n-Daily highscore mode\n-stuff to unlock\n\nCons:\n-gets repetetive after couple of weeks :)\n-no Demo\n-deaths are allways your fault :(\n-pretty unknown\n\nBuy it on sale - I even bought it for the full price and its money well spent.", "timestamp_created": 1470326306, "timestamp_updated": 1470326306, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500713", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24629819": {"recommendationid": "24629819", "author": {"steamid": "76561198270038678", "num_games_owned": 58, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 97, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470033339}, "language": "finnish", "review": "\ntoo bad that we did not have a save button\nbut overall its good ! : Crate : i recomend", "timestamp_created": 1469953757, "timestamp_updated": 1469953757, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24487897": {"recommendationid": "24487897", "author": {"steamid": "76561198160293446", "num_games_owned": 115, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 22634, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1231, "last_played": 1514342510}, "language": "english", "review": "In a single sentence, this game is amazingly fun and I can't stop playing it.\n\nI didn't have much experience in the rogue-lite genre before this, only playing a bit of Binding of Isaac and not really getting into that.

I tend to complain a lot, even about games I like. This though.. find much to complain about this. I'll try, though: the soundtrack is really dull, the flash when a fight starts hurts my eyes, some skills are probably weaker/stronger than others, and the game *could* have more content.\n\nThat's pretty much it. Otherwise, I love this. I like Binding of Isaac a lot, and this is just as good, though different. Obviously Isaac has more content at this point, after an expansion and Rebirth, but this game is so *solid*. The controls are good, the mechanics are good.. uhh, it's all good.\n\nMy favourite thing though is how the items/skills are designed. They're all different, more than just numbers. There's relatively little overlap, every skill is mechanically different and feels different. There's very little overlap (like, say, fireball/frost ball/lightning ball in some games), and they're all useful (though I admit I hate getting a few of them. Screw Blizzard). \n\nItems come mostly in sets of three, get the full set and get a really strong effect (like +50% ability power multiplier, ignore a hit every 11 seconds, get a powerful summon..). The set effects are all different, and nearly every one is good for some build/skillset (I say nearly only because I'm not sold on Phoenix set's flight, yet).\n\nI just love when a game is actually well designed.

The player travels in a world from area to area and is trying to make progress to the final boss of that world. Taking too long means \"shadows\" will reach you and it's a pretty bad thing. This is very similar to FTL's map.

interesting, and most skill-centric roguelike-like shooter out there. And then Flamebreak comes along and kicks it in the pants.\n\nFlamebreak takes the world map progress from FTL wholesale, but actually gives you smart decisions to make on the map, unlike FTL, with shops generally in specific locations the game will be happy to remind you of in tool tips and consumable items to warp back and forth, enhance shops, etc...\n\nAt each node is top down twin-stick/WASD+mouse combat. Your hero will have a random assortment of a weapon and three powers, each quite different, but all functional, leading to quite a few combinations. What you find on the map are stat upgrades, supplemental abilities, and gear sets to try to take these powers and spin them into overdrive. If you have a stun, a teleport, and a melee weapon, then you can focus on weapon attack, powers that bolster stun, etc etc. In another run, you could be dropping mines, summoning minions, and hurling fireballs buffed to 16x their original power if you play your cards right.\n\nEach screen is a short, bite sized skirmish, never running long, never spamming cheesy HP tanks BoI style at you, but always throwing some different combination of enemies and hazards.\n\nEverything in this game works phenomenally well. To describe it makes it sound mundane and boring, just cobbled together from bits you've seen before. And in a sense it is, but the execution skill in this game is second to none. It's easily one of the best in this subgenre.", "timestamp_created": 1465861667, "timestamp_updated": 1465861667, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.560804", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23539516": {"recommendationid": "23539516", "author": {"steamid": "76561197975490238", "num_games_owned": 341, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 314, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1465847631}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game, I think its one of those where the gameplay trailer may not do it justice.

It really captures that plug-and-play procedural action I've been looking for after hundreds of hours of The Binding of Isaac. It offers an immaculate blend of challenge and strategic options that keeps me engaged at the edge of my seat for the whole ~22-40 minute play session. I'm just starting to have hard-mode win-streaks. And even during a -29 lose streak I was having fun discovering character combinations and honing my exploration and gold-spending techniques. \n\nMy other favorite thing is the controls. I play mostly with a gamepad and the game offers seamless transition between playing with a controller and playing with keyboard and mouse. Simply move the mouse or joystick and the game snaps to the new control layout.

restart with the SAME guy. You also still have the reroll option that will reroll like normal. The blizzard animation was also changed is SOOO Much better!!\n\nTHANK YOU DEVS!!!! I changed my recommendation from a no to a yes. These small changes literally make the game SO much better!!! I can now grind through with a guy and retry as many times as I want which gives ample time to learn the ability combos first run through. And then start learning the patterns the next few times.  I cannot express how critical this was for my enjoyment of this game.\nI still think the game could benefit from a new \"easiest/noob/learning difficulty\" that let you choose your abilities/ skills. This really would make the game very beatable. But that would be the point. You would then have normal, hard, and daily to go through which is a TON and I mean a TON of replay ability. If you do end up making a noob mode I might also recommend that you disable the favor / spirit rewards when playing this new suggested difficulty.\n\nI bought this game because I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE altitude and wanted to support the devs. It combines a lot of elements of other games. The best way I can describe it would be a blend of final fantasy and the old raiden space ship game.  A ton of varied and random enemies that shoot and attack many different ways. It keeps it fresh and a LOT of fun.\n\nPros:\n\nThe game is challenging\nHas a lot of replay ability\nThe graphics and game play are quite smooth and interesting\nIt's well put together and thought out. Everything from the items, enemies, and the quality is very good.\n\nCons.\nI've removed them since the update. My biggest complaints with the game have been totally fixed and I can't tell you how happy this makes me. The game is at least 80% more enjoyable while still maintaining the challenge of the game.  It's no longer as brutal. \nPossible improvements:\nCreate a super noob difficulty where I can even pick the OP combos if I want. Let me learn how enemies move etc. Heavily handicap me so I can get a firm handle on the game before you throw me to the wolves. These mini bosses are quite tough. I mean I've died on the first map over 15 times. Got past that maybe 3 times. Never even to level 3. And there are like 15 or something levels! This is actually a good thing. I like the fact that it's so tough!! It's challenging but not impossible.\n\nThere are a lot of people who like to play games competitively. I only play for casual but I can see these things really helping those who like to compete.\n\n1. time trials? Leader boards\n2. There has to be abilities that are more favorable to others. Assign each ability a value and let the user choose which abilities he wants. The more desirable abilities \"cost\" more and as such reduce the person's arbitrary points on the leaderboard.\nSo if a guy chose all the best skills he would get less bonus points than someone who chose all of the least desirable skills.  \nMaybe have a board that spawns a guy every X second of a certian type. You get X amount of points per second you're alive?\n\nOther ideas:\nMore points for the following:\nHow much life did you lose over the course of the run?\nHow long did it take you?\nWhat bonus health % health did you give the enemies?\nWhat bonus damage % health did you give the enemies?\nhow many flawless?\nI'm sure there are abilities that would make it super hard. Then you could also give bonus points for reduced health, higher hit point enemies. You could make a whole bunch of things that you could make it harder or easier for the top of the top players to gain points. \nYou could reset the leader boards each time you tweak something. Or add different runs that are preset boards. \nSuggestions continued:\nI wish you would explain what fight power is or mastery. There are many stats you can get from items but it's not quite clear what they do or how they work. Same way with the gods favor.  They explain you can earn favor by destroying the other god's temples etc, but not really what they do for you. Of course it's a buff. There just isn't enough training. \n\nThey have a training thing before you start the game where two guys spawn. They don't attack or anything. They are there to get used to how your guys works. I think this could be expanded on. Be able to select how many guys to spawn. What type of guys. Do they move? Do they attack? Do you want blizzards to spawn? So you want laser beams? This could be good training level.

It is rare these days that a game makes good use of rogue-like elements, rather than just adding them for the sake of it.

There is a good amount of weapons, races and abilities to choose from and all of them really affect the gameplay. There are even multiple final bosses!

The only downside to this game is that various abilities, races and god powers are clearly better than others, which results in you re-rolling characters several times if you want a better chance at winning the game.", "timestamp_created": 1450816477, "timestamp_updated": 1450816477, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19846341": {"recommendationid": "19846341", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072709921", "num_games_owned": 353, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 453, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1459894135}, "language": "english", "review": "Only played a little but it's good so far.", "timestamp_created": 1450803987, "timestamp_updated": 1450803987, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19811913": {"recommendationid": "19811913", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016487261", "num_games_owned": 347, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 8719, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 173, "last_played": 1514151859}, "language": "english", "review": "An excellent arena shooter with plenty of variety in characters, skills, weapons, mob behaviors and upgrades.\n\nHowever, the balance for character/weapon is awful. The faerie's ability to move around the arena makes it dramatically superior to every other race, and the crossbow's range means that all other weapons are utterly useless, by comparison. Melee weapons need tremendous damage buffs and, if there are going to be races that can't avoid attacks? Then how about beefing them up so that they can withstand attacks. There needs to be at-least one other weapon on-par with the crossbow's range, because the other ranged weapons are all just \"oh look: I rolled something that is not as-good as the crossbow.\"\n\nThe random-rolling of race, weapon and skills being a core aspect of gameplay is nice. But there is a single, incontestably superior result for each, which makes it really frustrating to roll for a second-best. And the slowest races and least-ranged weapons are pure garbage, because they can neither avoid nor score attacks, and don't have boosts in health and damage to compensate for how often you get hit and rarely you deal hits. You want to try a mage? Too bad: you get killed too fast. A close range fighter? Sorry--everything ran away, you can't catch it, and you get killed too fast. A tricky, technical fighter that pulls enemies in? Sorry--you don't deal enough damage before your interrupts wear off and you die because you can't dodge anything. A summoner? Sorry--your summons all die in a single hit and you still get killed too fast. A quick, ranged character? Good thing you made the only viable choice; now hope that you rolled the quickest character and highest range because otherwise you're just playing a second-rate version of it.\n\nIt desperately needs more weapons at highest-range and huge damage boosts to sword and dagger.

(Most areas, involve an arena battle, but sometime you will see an area on the overworld-map that has a town, or bazaar or other non-dangerous location to spend the coins you have accumulated.) Each area of the overworld has a boss on the Northern edge of the map. There is an inherent trade-off between exploring more to find/buy better items with which to face the boss, versus avoiding needless battles which may require you to consume precious health potions. (Health potions are a limited resource, use them with care.) Finally, there is a shadow that slowly advances Northward across the overworld-map, which puts some mild pressure on you to work your way Northward, and prevents you from fully exploring each area of the overworld.\n\nThe place where this game shines is in the variety of fights you encounter on your journey. The game features a large number of enemies, each with its own unique attack patterns. Each fight consists of a small number of different types of enemies -- Enemy marksman are typically weak, but when they are protected by foes who lay mines, the fights gets a bit more exciting [at least for a melee character <grin>]. Additionally, many fights have environmental hazards -- like damaging hail-storms that move randomly around the map, or bullets being fired randomly from off-screen.\n\nTo tackle these challenges, your character has access to a weapon and three different skills. Your race determines your starting stats and one of your skills. (For instance, Dwarves are slow, but have lots of hit points and deal bonus damage with weapon attacks -- and Dwarves can right-click to stun enemies around then. Alternatively, Faires are very fast and their skills cooldown more quickly, but they have few hit points and do less damage per attack -- and Faires can right-click to teleport instantly in battle.)  The starting weapons are well-designed and each plays very differently -- for instance, swords swing in an arc for strong AOE melee damage, crossbows cripple enemies they hit, slowing their movement. Finally, the game provides a wide variety of active skills, including utility and movement skills -- for those who want to kill foes with weapons -- to high damage spells.\n\nThe variety of weapons, races, and skills provides the game with a ton of replayability. At the start of each run, the game randomly generates three possible heroes for you to choose from. This allows you to pick the style of hero you enjoy, but the exact combination of skills will be different each run. Experimenting to get the most out of your combination of skills is a ton of fun. For example, there is a backstab skill that teleports you behind a foe and deals a percentage of your weapon damage. If you have this skill on a burly dwarf with a sword and an AOE stun, then you can backstab into the middle of a group of enemies and stun them all. Alternatively, if you are playing human with a crossbow, you can get more use out of the backstab skill by targeting an isolated foe on the other side of the battle in order to escape a rush of melee attackers.", "timestamp_created": 1445796108, "timestamp_updated": 1445831536, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.638016", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18662203": {"recommendationid": "18662203", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073051103", "num_games_owned": 229, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 352, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1450593049}, "language": "english", "review": "Deep and rewarding.

It uses a top-down view. You choose a character from three randomized options. You can reroll the options, but if you've managed to beat the game the reroll will end your winning streak. \n\nTo start you have an overworld. You move one space and then fight some mobs or go into a merchant to buy something. The mobs can be easy or have extremely tough. The merchants sell stuff like potions or gear. Healing potions can only be used in the over world view - not while fighting mobs. Making this game really tough.\n\nEach region in the overworld is basically a 'level'. The region ends with a boss. I've never made it past the fourth boss. \n\nThis game is ridiculously difficult. And after dying you have to start over completely - no saving it before a boss and trying again. Nope, to get back to the same spot you're looking at another 15 to 20 minutes - reminiscent of the old Nintendo games like Super Mario Bros, but with only one chance to get to Bowzer. \n\nAnyway, it's okay. It's very arcade style. It's mostly just run around the screen avoiding flying things and clicking on different mobs to eventually kill them. It's pretty mindless. \n\nI've enjoyed it, but it's a \"sit and play for 30 minutes\" game, not a \"waste an afternoon and most of a night\". \n", "timestamp_created": 1445645152, "timestamp_updated": 1445645152, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.970090", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18625831": {"recommendationid": "18625831", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081967345", "num_games_owned": 203, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 370, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486815800}, "language": "english", "review": "Game is great.

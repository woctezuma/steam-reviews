So anyway, there I am, whistling at the girls 'cause they're all hot for the sweet ride, and all of a sudden there's an alarm and four guys just dive into the van and yell at me to drive them to the diner. I'm like, whoa, don't know what your deal is, but okay, don't need to get these guys angry, and off we go.\n\nNext thing I know there's sirens and cop cars everywhere. Now you know the cops hate me 'cause they tried to bust me for possession back in March but my Uncle Rick got me out and got the chief busted down to patrolman, but this time they were ALL over me! I haven't seen that many black-and-whites since the big buy-one-get-one donut sale. Well, I think I still got that bench warrant out for me so I ain't looking to go in the back of one of those cruisers, so pedal to metal. And those cops were all over me! Like, driving off bridges and cliffs trying to ram me. But Rick keeps a minigun in the back of the van, 'cause Second Amendment, and one of the guys just starts unloading and popping those pigs like balloons.\n\nWell, we get to the diner, the guys pile out, and me, I decide it's time to get outta town for a little bit, let the heat die down, y'know? So I kinda just nudge a city bus, it spins out, and like four cop cars slam right into it. Looked like one of those action flicks, for serious!

The game may sound simple, but it's all the extra trappings that push this one well ahead of it's competition. An entire lot of cars to buy with in game cash, tons of weapons to purchase that give this title it's twin stick elements, mods that can be installed, a perk system that can be customized and earned through each successful drop-off, stat boosting for each vehicle, multiple levels! The list goes on and on for ways that you can customize your own experience and style in this game. Even the graphic options shine here, with the ability to make the game look like a 70's VHS cop show, or if you prefer, clean up the visuals with a more \"modern\" look.

Imagine having 4 or 5 friends sitting in the van, all shooting out while one guy drives.\n\nThe art-style reminds me of hotline Miami a bit, with VHS lines and blurring.  It adds to the whole 70's heist feel, and I like it.  The soundtrack is awesome and fits the game perfectly.\n\nGameplay does feel slightly repetitive at times, while your main objective to consistently drive from heist to hideout, then heist to hideout, etc.  Again, full multiplayer would remedy this, especially if there was cops vs. robbers PvP.\n\nAll in all, the game is fun and worth picking up.", "timestamp_created": 1510862196, "timestamp_updated": 1510862196, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.632258", "comment_count": "6", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36449970": {"recommendationid": "36449970", "author": {"steamid": "76561198177315054", "num_games_owned": 226, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 436, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1514245620}, "language": "english", "review": "Got this while it was in early development and it was quite good.

Not only because some passages would be easier then, but also because I want to see the beautiful worlds from that perspective. \nAnother thing that I would really like to be added is multiplayer. I also think that an online multiplayer (not via servers but maybe so that one player is the host) would match the gameplay better than offline multiplayer.\n I know that this is early access and a lot of things will happen to the game until it's final release but nevertheless I decided to sharey suggestions. I hope that's no problem ^^\nAll in All I really love the game and I can't wait to see what future updates will bring to it.

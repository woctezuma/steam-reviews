They cut much of what made me hate replaying the first game a second time, and gave me more content.  The game is rather excellent in gameplay, but it still has a few issues. \n\nThe biggest change with this game is that while they cut out the \"alternative\" games (the different centuries with different gameplay that just wasn't that enjoyable) they did implement a full story and adventure where the player runs around between quests.  It allows a more coherent story and world, and is an interesting change. \n\nThe only real problem I have with the game is the game sticks to the two line dialog screens, which would be fine, if they weren't filled with the dullest story ever, and it tries to stretch it out for 77 levels.   It's not that it's bad but I've put in 16 hours into the game so far, I'll probably have to put in double that to fully get everything and the fact is the story is long and not very good.   Time goddess is greedy, main characters are doofs, enemies are funny.  I wish there was more focus on the enemies or the \"Theme\" of each level, than trying to character build characters that have been built up well for 30-40 levels already.  \n\nIt's not bad, but it's just there's a lot of story and it's not as engaging as I think it wants to be. \n\nOn the other hand, the gameplay itself is better than ever.  Enemies appear on the map so there's no feeling of randomness while running around the overworld or dungeons.  There's maps for some of the larger dungeons.  The ability to use Goddess statues on maps (if they are placed), free heals (if placed), new features, a rather enjoyable plot line (even if the story is weak), and great new mechanics. \n\nEach stage is similar for the most part.  A 30 second count down with a way to reset it, usually paying the goddess statue money to give you a brand new 30 seconds.  Two titles on each stage (you no longer have to beat the stage to save them, thank god), they added in \"medals\" for the player to find while walking around between levels (mostly just investigate anything that's unique or out of place, I've found almost every one without a guide)\n\nBut I really like when the game breaks these rules.  I've seen a 99 second count down with no way to reset, I've seen timers based on something other than the typical \"Spell of destruction being cast\" and each of these stages are a breath of fresh air.   The other levels though are great and unique as well.  There's a good variety of targets and mechanics that you will need to use to beat the stage rather than always running to the end of the stage getting levels and beating the boss. \n\nTo me it feels like the first game was constrained by the engine and rules they made, they rules remain in the sequel but are able to be broken that it's a lot of fun to see what's coming next.\n\nSo I easily recommend this game.  I am having a ton of fun and at 10 bucks that's a great price, plus you get the original game as well.  I recommend playing the original game first, because it is enjoyable, but if you enjoy the Hero 30 storyline in the original game, I can't stress enough that you should play the sequel.  It honestly feels like they did the original game and then did it correctly this time.  It's not a remake, but it feels like it's a improved version of what they wanted to do in the first game.", "timestamp_created": 1511812679, "timestamp_updated": 1511812679, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.548326", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37614388": {"recommendationid": "37614388", "author": {"steamid": "76561198116817530", "num_games_owned": 239, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1637, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511667325}, "language": "english", "review": "Cool strory bruh", "timestamp_created": 1511667424, "timestamp_updated": 1511667424, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.441551", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37306791": {"recommendationid": "37306791", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051003146", "num_games_owned": 102, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4714, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511520195}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u738b\u9053\u306e\u4e2d\u306e\u738b\u9053\n\u500b\u4eba\u7684\u306b\u306f\uff32\uff30\uff27\u306e\u5341\u672c\u306e\u6307\u306b\u5165\u308b\u307b\u3069\u306e\u51fa\u6765\u3002\n\u3069\u306e\u4e3b\u4eba\u516c\u3082\u500b\u6027\u7684\u3067\u3001\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3092\u3057\u7d9a\u3051\u308b\u3046\u3061\u306b\u3068\u3066\u3082\u611b\u7740\u304c\u6e67\u3044\u3066\u304f\u308b\u3002\n\u662f\u975e\u3001\u524d\u4f5c\u3092\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3057\u3066\u304b\u3089\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3057\u3066\u6b32\u3057\u3044\uff08\u51fa\u6765\u308c\u3070\u3084\u308a\u3053\u3093\u3067\u304b\u3089\uff09", "timestamp_created": 1511520471, "timestamp_updated": 1511520471, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36850820": {"recommendationid": "36850820", "author": {"steamid": "76561198137035216", "num_games_owned": 65, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 126, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510681655}, "language": "italian", "review": "All'inizio sentivo che non riuscisse ad essere ai livelli del primo, ma pi\u00f9 giocavo e pi\u00f9 mi ricredevo, davvero un capolavoro", "timestamp_created": 1511392338, "timestamp_updated": 1511392338, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36408119": {"recommendationid": "36408119", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054561699", "num_games_owned": 251, "num_reviews": 46, "playtime_forever": 1873, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1398148245}, "language": "english", "review": "You're not going to find anything quite like this anywhere.

Naturally of course this is a single player, story driven RPG where grinding is THE ENTIRE POINT of the game and makes it of the best paced RPGs I have ever played. I mean, it's genius. Just take a story of a JRPG, have the combat system be the most optimal move auto-spammed endlessly (like a usual turned based RPG for grinding), and have the combat speed multiplied by 60. Then BAM! You take what would have been an half hour grinding in a dungeon in a regular RPG is turned into a half minute race against the clock to beat the boss. I suppose on that point it is less of an RPG and more of a puzzle game, where you attempt to find the most optimal way to grind and beat the boss in 30 seconds.

first game. The story is funny, and when it gets serious out of nowhere it is, most of the time, really done well. \nCompared to the first game, the tone is really different and the game itself stops being a complete parody around the end of the first \"chapter\" (Overture).\nThe gameplay keeps the core mechanic of the first game and greatly expands it, being basically Hero 30 with classes, a new revamped Allies system and skills. It kinda slows down compared to the first one thanks to the skills but there is a way to turn their effects off to get the feeling of rush from the first game.\nWhile I do recommend playing its prequel first, especially because the story has some important ties to the first one, it is not required at all and most of the jokes and characters won't really stop being interesting.\nThe crafting and cassino system are not really well done, but they are not required at all and are clearly there to keep the game going after it ended, though are not executed really well.\nOn the other hand, the Time Attack, Map Creation are really cool and can keep people who really liked the game interested. The game has some really cool quests, but that can be kind of \"grindy\" if people didn't really like the Global System, which is a system that tranforms the game into a more traditional RPG outside of the main quests.\nFinally, the game has loads of content, and if people liked the core gameplay, they really won't be running out of time anytime soon, as long as they have the coins needed to keep going.", "timestamp_created": 1483464867, "timestamp_updated": 1483464907, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521510", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28836061": {"recommendationid": "28836061", "author": {"steamid": "76561198144793051", "num_games_owned": 18, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 5067, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490831832}, "language": "english", "review": "THIS GAME.\n\n\n\nTHIS GAME.\n\n\n\nYou want it.\n\nAnd once you beat it.\n\n\n\nYou will beat it again.\n\n\n\n9001/10 will Run in the Fast Lane again.", "timestamp_created": 1483118868, "timestamp_updated": 1483118868, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.360565", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28640973": {"recommendationid": "28640973", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041022987", "num_games_owned": 149, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 74, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482687897}, "language": "english", "review": "Waaaaaaaaaaaay to repetitive.

Potremo anche personalizzarlo e renderlo pi\u00f9 efficace contro i mostri giganti, oltre che usarlo come nostra base mobile dove ospitare i nostri membri del party, controllare gli obbiettivi mancanti e forgiare, se lo vogliamo, armi nuove che non troveremmo in giro per la mappa.\nPer chi se lo stesse chiedendo: s\u00ec, la Dea del Tempo \u00e8 sempre la solita avaraccia e continuer\u00e0 a richiederci offerte in denaro per completare una missione, ma almeno potremo sbloccare dei costumi alternativi per lei: una dea in divisa scolastica ha sempre un suo perch\u00e9.", "timestamp_created": 1480171587, "timestamp_updated": 1480171939, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27567118": {"recommendationid": "27567118", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052906116", "num_games_owned": 66, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 351, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474149211}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun, inventive, and just as funny as the first one", "timestamp_created": 1480116717, "timestamp_updated": 1480116717, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.471570", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27505918": {"recommendationid": "27505918", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993839146", "num_games_owned": 791, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1270, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480093004}, "language": "english", "review": "[b]Summary[/b]\n\nIf you've played Half-Minute Hero (the first game), The Second Coming is a true sequel that certainly builds upon its origins but on a much larger scale. You control a small, useless \"hero\" in an RPG world, set to save that very world from certain destruction. Not much different from most other classic RPGs, I know. The one caveat is that you only have 30 seconds to do so, and therein lies the series' unique gameplay and quirky humour.\n\nRush through the intro, the world is about to end. Battle monsters to level up, do side quests to unlock alternate routes or equipment, become better than the Evil Lords and destroy them, all in less than half a minute. Just as you've completed the credits, a new threat appears, and you have to do it all over again! While it is possible to beat many of the quests (levels) within this time limit, you actually get to rewind time to make it all more digestible. Though, the Goddess of Time is not a fan of the greater good, as she takes an increasingly larger fee each time you make use of her ability.\n\n[b]New additions[/b]\n\nThe Second Coming contains several new campaigns to a tried and loved concept without changing the formulae too much. While the first game was a nice little distraction from daily chores, you'll have to take a week off to complete all of the content in this game. And you should complete it all, as that is where a lot of this game's quirkyness and gameplay challenge actually lies. In addition to a plethora of new quests, there's also a map editor and a multiplayer segment added, so the fun can continue endlessly if you so wish! And if the map editor is not enough, there is literally an endless mode as well, which is comparable to a boss rush.\n\nIt's definitely a title that hands you a unique experience along with a lot to do compared to what you paid for it.

mistake, this is one of my top 10 games of all time. And it almost didn't come to the West at all. It was a Japan only PSP game for years before getting ported on the fly due to the success of the first game on Steam.\n\nHalf Minute Hero 2 is a direct sequel to the first Half Minute Hero, and it contains similar gameplay to the Hero mode from the original. You play as a series of powerful heroes in different time periods and must embark on a mission to save the world from whatever threat exists at that point in time. The twist? It's only 30 seconds till the world is destroyed and only the Time Goddess can turn back time and let you survive - but only if you pay her.\n\nThis sets the stage for one of the most crazy fast-paced RPGs ever made, and while it felt somewhat repetitive in the original game, The Second Coming turns it up to 11 with a huge cast of characters, eargasmic music from the greatest video game composers to ever grace the planet, and even a giant mecha-slash-castle that serves as a home base AND a robotic monster slaying machne.\n\nVery few games have used many heroes across time before, but when they do, they seem to pull it off very well. Just look at Live A Live. This game is no exception and the story keeps on getting better as the game progresses.\n\nThat's not to say this game isn't flawed, far from it. The missions can still be a little repetitious as the game goes on, and the story, while fun, won't win any awards for best writing (though it may hit you in the feels). But as a sum of its parts, it's a glorious homage to old school RPGs while not getting bogged down with old school gameplay and being original enough to do its own thing.", "timestamp_created": 1479931200, "timestamp_updated": 1479931200, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528430", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26799140": {"recommendationid": "26799140", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061809540", "num_games_owned": 564, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3335, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479927631}, "language": "english", "review": "30 secs of fun.

THE BEST BANG FOR YOUR BUCK\n\nCons:\n- New mechanics certainly made the game more enjoyable, but also easier. On roaming, you can still level up but slower, these level up DO carry on into missions, so you are not gonna start from level one as always, but from level X (X, being your current roaming level). Also you can use late-game weapons so you can repeat missions completely broken on power\n- The level maker was a good startup, but an underdeveloped idea.

Here is your chance\n\nThe first Half Minute Hero was ingenious puzzle game where the goal was to complete different kind of areas under 30 second. If the 30 second goal was failed, then time could be rewinded for ever increasing pay. The first game also featured some jrpg elements like new equipment (which couldn't be brought to earlier levels).\n\nHalf Minute Hero: The Second Coming takes the mechanics of the first game and jrpgfies them and adds some completely new mechanics. Some of the changes are global level ups and removal of equipment restrictions. This results the game being considerably easier than the first game and time of the levels doesn't really matter anymore. There is time attack mode, but unfortunately it suffers also from the same global character syndrome.\n\nHowever, what is achieved with those changes is that the Half Minute Hero: The Second Coming is a genuine rpg and a very good one. Admitted, the script is written without much thought, but half asessed parody of more popular rpg branches goes well with this game. Half Minute Hero SC knows what it is capable and doesn't try to be anything else than light-jrpg...\n\nWell that is besides the music, for some reason the soundtrack of the game is really over the top and features songs/compositions from 24 different artists. This includes multiple Final Fantasy composers and Chrono Trigger composer. And if you think those were the only ones worth mentioning, you are very wrong (the list just would be too long). Soundtrack of the Half Minute Hero SC doesn't pale in comparison to any other game-soundtrack. It isn't long, but it is compact and packs a huge punch and enhances the game massively! What is best about the soundtrack is how it is used. There are moments in the game where the soundtrack is utilized near utmost perfection. For example final mission of Ragnarok story arc and its vocal track was something from which those big and old franchises could learn.

It will create the most beautiful and awesome game made in anime heaven. \nFor most people this would seem like a turn-off from the first game since it would take nearly everything from the story, art and a bit of the soundtrack out of the window. They would expect another same looking JRPG with a bit more fleshed out story and gameplay than the first one, but instead they got a massive RPGmaker looking game coated in anime weaboo sparkles.\n\nAm I the only one who was actually ok with this? Yea? Ok then.\n\n\nWeaboo Review:\n\nFor me, the story was AMAZING. It literally was a massive throwback to all my favorite action animes, Dragon Ball Z, Gundam, Code Geass, etc. It was complete with some 4th wall breaking jokes and the ending battle cliche where the protag remembers his fallen friends and the protag's journey to fight his own fate/destiny. There was a LOT of reading to be done in this game though. It's almost like a VN. \n\n-Story- Game w/ weaboo glasses:       10000/10\n\nReal Review:\n\nStory w/out weaboo glasses:  5/10\n\nNow, taking the weaboo glasses off, the story was almost bland to the extent of pissing people off. The characters didn't seem to have that much depth. The first protag guy who seemed to be the stereotypical Kirito, who at first seemed really normal-ish but then got kicked in the nuts by reality and now turns into a overreactional emo b*tch. The other protag characters were also stereotypical, the girl protag who raises your hopes of being more fleshed out than the other ones but turned out to be another determined stereotypical Asuna (who cries alot). The third one was simply... Naruto. Just.. Naruto. There's literally no other way I can express him.\n\n\nThe gameplay was basically the same as the first one except they threw out all of the cleveressness and the parody-ish style of the first one where they mocked the all the grinding in JRPG games and instead replaced it with just.. Grinding. Like, grinding for ?? f*cking minutes to get to  lvl ????? You can literally brute force your way to any situation. It literally goes like this. \n\n Get Objective ---> Grind ---> ???? ---> Profit\n\nI myself didn't really fell the grind while playing this game because the dialouge usually kept things fresh with a small joke or some 4th wall breaking. They also added a bit of a mech thing gameplay that I don't really get. It didn't actually change anything from the original fast-paced grinding of the first one but.. it was simply a thing. That was there. o.O\n\nGameplay: 6/10\n\nThe art? Ehh, the first one was better. \nThe first one gave it a standard-ish RPG looking game that you would normally find on other online flash games like Kongregate, etc. which you don't usually find in other JRPG games and gave it a really unique and memorable feel to the game. The second one just seems like another one of those... RPG maker types of games. >.>\n\nArt: 6/10 (Why is it not 5? Because of the PLOT.)\n\nSoundtrack? Umm.. It was okay I guess...?\nIt didn't really stand out much apart from the boss scenes when you're rewarded with rock music blaring from your speakers that would make any rock fan proud. The music at times gets cut off by battles with monsters and after you complete them it starts back from the start. So you can't really enjoy the soundtrack unless you literally just put your controller down and listen.\n\nAin't nobody got time for dat.\n\nSo yeah.. 6/10 for the soundtrack.\n\n\nAnd right now, I could just guess what you're thinking, 'With all these horrible scores why would you recommend this game?' Because I can't. I really can't not (double negatives woo) recommend this game. My inner weaboo keeps my hand from clicking the No in the recommendation bar. So to anyone who is still reading don't buy this game if you CAN'T STAND action cliche's or just anime in general.", "timestamp_created": 1451823727, "timestamp_updated": 1451823727, "voted_up": true,

hype. Other times they hardly change the formula and are just an updated version. Others blow the original right out of the water and make you remember them more than anything else (example: Assassins Creed 2)\n\nI feel that Half Minute Hero 2 does just that. Adding more to do than just the story missions, easier ways to replay levels, and giving players a way to get a leg up in the next missions, rewarding them in a way for playing and exploring the world for the hidden goodies. Oh and that you don't have to replay a mission to go BUY stuff you missed is nice.\n\nThough this time the story is clearly the important part, which is more than fine by me. I just wish it was a bit more self aware than it is, more like HMH1, but that said, I DO love the world, characters and story enough so it doesn't bother me too much.\n\nSo if you wanted a bit more meat than what Half Minute Hero One did, Half Minute Hero Two gives you a steak instead of BBQ Ribs.\n\n10/10 would pay goddess gold to reset time again... and again... and again!", "timestamp_created": 1451339717, "timestamp_updated": 1451339729, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20013272": {"recommendationid": "20013272", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999086138", "num_games_owned": 1708, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 233, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451588057}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041d\u0430\u0447\u0430\u043b\u043e \u043c\u0438\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438 \u2116[x]: \n-\u0410\u0425\u0410\u0425\u0410\u0425\u0410\u0425\u0410 \u042f \u041e\u0427\u0415\u0420\u0415\u0414\u041d\u041e\u0419 \u0417\u041b\u041e\u0414\u0415\u0419, \u041f\u041e\u042f\u0412\u0418\u0412\u0428\u0418\u0419\u0421\u042f \u0418\u0417 \u041d\u0418\u041e\u0422\u041a\u0423\u0414\u0410 \u0418 \u042f \u0423\u041d\u0418\u0427\u0422\u041e\u0416\u0423 \u042d\u0422\u0418 \u0417\u0415\u041c\u041b\u0418 \u0411\u0415\u0417 \u041a\u0410\u041a\u041e\u0419-\u041b\u0418\u0411\u041e \u041f\u0420\u0418\u0427\u0418\u041d\u042b! \u0410\u0425\u0410\u0425\u0410\u0425! \u0414\u041b\u042f \u042d\u0422\u041e\u0413\u041e \u042f \u041d\u0410\u041a\u0410\u0421\u0422\u0423\u042e \u0417\u0410\u041a\u041b\u0418\u041d\u0410\u041d\u0418\u0415 \u0423\u041d\u0418\u0427\u0422\u041e\u0416\u0415\u041d\u0418\u042f, \u0427\u0422\u041e \u0417\u0410\u0419\u041c\u0415\u0422 \u0420\u041e\u0412\u041d\u041e 30 \u0421\u0415\u041a\u0423\u041d\u0414!\n-\u041e \u043d\u0435\u0442! \u0413\u043b\u0430\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0433\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0439, \u043c\u044b \u0434\u043e\u043b\u0436\u043d\u044b \u0447\u0442\u043e-\u0442\u043e \u0441\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0442\u044c!\n(\u0414\u0430\u043b\u0435\u0435 \u0438\u0434\u0443\u0442 \u043a\u0438\u043b\u043e\u043c\u0435\u0442\u0440\u044b \u0442\u0443\u043f\u043e\u0439 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u0442\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0438. \u0421\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0430 \u0431\u043e\u0433\u0443, \u0435\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u043f\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0442\u044c.)\n-\u041e \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0438\u043a)) \u0410 \u044f \u0442\u0438\u043f\u0430 \u0431\u043e\u0433\u0438\u043d\u044f) \u0438 \u043c\u043e\u0433\u0443 \u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f \u0438 \u0434\u0430\u0436\u0435 \u043e\u0442\u043a\u0430\u0442\u044b\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0435\u0433\u043e \u043d\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0434))) \u041d\u043e \u0437\u0430 \u0441\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0435\u0434\u043b\u0438\u0432\u0443\u044e \u0441\u0442\u043e\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c))\n\u0421\u043a\u0430\u0436\u0435\u043c, \u043f\u043e \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0441\u0435 \u0438\u0437 \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0447\u0435\u0442\u0430 100\u0445n, \u0433\u0434\u0435 n - \u043a\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u043e\u0442\u043a\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0432 \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438)) \u0445\u0438\u0445\u0438\u0445 [\u0441\u0435\u0440\u0434\u0435\u0447\u043a\u043e] \n\u0427\u0442\u043e, \u043d\u0435\u0442 \u0434\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0433?

This sequel of \"Half Minute Hero\" expands on the simple game-play by adding more items, skills, and developing the already amazing storyline. \"Second Coming\" has a more traditional RPG feel but still has a distinguishable style that fans have come to love from the first game. One new feature allows the player to level up the base level of the hero. This allows a player to start at a higher level when they begin a new quest. Another new feature is the ability to create and share custom maps with other players. A core mechanic from \u201cHalf Minute Hero\u201d is the ability to find new armor and weapons as you play the game. You are able to go back and play the same map again so that you can earn weapons that you may have missed. You may also find a different path that may lead to a secret. These new features, combined with the story, make this game worth buying.\n\nThe \u201cHero 30\u201d series is known to have a great story that spans across the different game modes. The story is filled with great characters to fight by your side, tongue and cheek comedy, and the every so greedy Time Goddess. It takes place hundreds of years after the first game where the Hero has saved the world from destruction. I won't spoil the story for you as it is very well done and is worth experiencing for yourself.

But this game brings something that the previous entries don't, world map traversal, this is the calm before the storm, a gentle stroll in between your 30 second quests, along with a new mechanic. G-level, this is your base level before you enter quests, so you can grind, before you grind! Genius!\n\n Other new features to the game include time attack, and workshop content.

Like all sequels it does everything its predecessor did with bells and whistles added. Unlike the previous title, you get an art gallery, unlockable costumes for the Time Goddess, and  a more cohesive plotline with cutscenes and character development.\n\nBut that's what's off-putting for some. The first title had miniature 30 second quests selected from a world map where the boss, area, and quest were all self-contained. The bosses were made to be humorous and you'd get a small 4 sentence 'epilogue' to the quest that had a joke or two in it. The plot-line was backdrop: it merely explained why you were traveling the world.\n\nThe Second Coming places the plot in center-row and heavily emphasizes it. You get cut-scenes pre and post quest, flashbacks while you travel the world map, and character exposition and development. Bosses are no longer humorous with ridiculous motivations for their actions: they are taken much more seriously. Granted, we aren't dealing with Final Fantasy levels of writing and exposition, but the humor is considerably toned down. You'll either appreciate the expansion or hate it vehemently.\n\nThere were some casualties in transitioning to a story-driven game. Whereas you were timed in the previous title and graded on it after a quest, this game merely continues on with the storyline after a quest is finished. They've done away with the quest completion screen, which details your time and objectives completed, so the game places less emphasis on speed-running. Ironically, time is less emphasized in the series than ever before. \n\nThe sequel DOES fu*k up in two indisputable ways: the ability to go back to completed quests in a time trial mode and the ability to level up in the over-world map. When you level up outside of a quest, your level carries over to the next quest. Which means the element of grinding is introduced in a series where a 30 second quest's challenges include getting strong enough to defeat a boss. You can realistically grind outside of a quest so that when you enter it you're already set to beat the boss, which is beyond retarded in this series. Secondly, while you can go back to completed quests to beat the clock, you keep all of your current equipment and levels, which is doubly insane and defeats the point of the 30 second timer and a time trial challenge.\n\nGranted, you don't NEED to grind, ever. But the fact that it's even an option is just as bad as auto-aim in a PC FPS. \n\nTwo fuck-ups aside I'm really split on this game. The previous title had a more arcade-like feel and you could pick up and play it whenever and put it down a minute later. This title has a more continuous feel to it, and in transitioning to a serious RPG some of the humor of the last title is lost. I miss bosses that wanted to blow up the world because others confused their species for a similar looking species. But it's still an enjoyable title that tries something new with the base 'Half-Minute Hero' experience still lying underneath. \n", "timestamp_created": 1434581470, "timestamp_updated": 1434581470, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 57, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.793619", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16460950": {"recommendationid": "16460950", "author": {"steamid": "76561198182747590", "num_games_owned": 26, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1247, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501970588}, "language": "english", "review": "If you like defeating op monsters in a super-fast battle,this game is for you.", "timestamp_created": 1434509843, "timestamp_updated": 1434509843, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502678", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16459261": {"recommendationid": "16459261", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993326000", "num_games_owned": 314, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 22, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1434502846}, "language": "english", "review": "worth it just for the music", "timestamp_created": 1434502935, "timestamp_updated": 1434502935, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496806", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16420148": {"recommendationid": "16420148", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010973178", "num_games_owned": 447, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 2372, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1440521232}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u5236\u9650\u6642\u959330\u79d2\u5185\u306b\u6575\u3092\u5012\u3057\u3066\u304a\u91d1\u3092\u7a3c\u3044\u3067\u88c5\u5099\u54c1\u3092\u8cb7\u3063\u3066\n\u30dc\u30b9\u3092\u5012\u3057\u3066\u3092\u7e70\u308a\u8fd4\u3057\u3066\u6642\u306e\u5973\u795e\u306b\u304a\u91d1\u3092\u8ca2\u3050\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\n\u30b7\u30ca\u30ea\u30aa\u306f\u524d\u4f5c\u306e\u767b\u5834\u4eba\u7269\u304c\u51fa\u3066\u304d\u305f\u308a\u3059\u308b\u306e\u3067\u3001\n\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3092\u3057\u3066\u3044\u306a\u3044\u65b9\u306f\u3053\u308c\u3092\u6a5f\u4f1a\u306b\u662f\u975e\n\nMAP\u306b\u3088\u3063\u3066\u306f\u5973\u795e\u30ed\u30fc\u30f3(1\u79d2\u30673%\u306e\u4f4e\u91d1\u5229\uff09\u3067\u8cc7\u91d1\u8abf\u9054\u3082\u53ef\u80fd\n\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8\u30af\u30ea\u30a2\u5f8c\u306b\u8fd4\u6e08\u3092\u8feb\u3089\u308c\u8fd4\u3055\u306a\u3044\u3068\u501f\u91d1\u9ce5(\u3059\u3052\u30fc\u5f37\u3044)\u3068\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb\n\n\u500b\u4eba\u7684\u306b\u306f1\u3088\u308a\u3053\u3063\u3061\u306e\u65b9\u304c\u597d\u304d\nBGM\u304c\u3059\u3054\u304f\u30ab\u30c3\u30b3\u3044\u3044\u306e\u3067\u662f\u975e\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3057\u3066\u6b32\u3057\u3044\u3067\u3059\n\u30bb\u30fc\u30eb\u3067245\u5186\u306a\u3089\u8cb7\u3063\u3066\u640d\u306f\u306a\u3044\u3067\u3057\u3087!", "timestamp_created": 1434383183, "timestamp_updated": 1434383183, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510450", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16399901": {"recommendationid": "16399901", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073088368", "num_games_owned": 368, "num_reviews": 90, "playtime_forever": 1812, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484961187}, "language": "english", "review": "This is another game that I just finished and once you start this game off it's really hard to stop playing it.

They took everything about the first game's retro RPG style and turned it completely weeaboo...

Sh*t, i'm speechless. How can i put this down? Let's see... Take the character development, the RPG style and the feels of the Final Fantasy golden era, and a ground-breaking game concept such as the 1st Half Minute Hero game. Give them some wine, some private space, you know what i'm talking about. Wait for 30 seconds and you get this game. This game just feels like it knows what it is, and does what it should do amazingly. The first game did it nicely, but... there was something missing. The RPG feel was kinda lacking, the character development was not done to maximum potential, and the gameplay just felt a bit too linear. It was basically a concept with an insane amount of potential. Now, don't take me wrong. i played the game, i liked it. But this game managed to squeeze every ounce of potential off of the concept, and did it in the best way possible. The sheer amounts of content in this game are impressive. Multiplayer, Level Editor, Steam Workshop support, infinite mode, time attack And almost 30 hours of main storyline. The soundtrack is possibly one of the most well composed ones out there, boosting the game feel by a lot. None of the characters in this game are stand-off or flat in any way, but the game doesn't slap your face with their attitudes, and are just dang fun to play with. The storyline's fairly simple to understand, but complex enough to keep you interested into what's going to happen. As i already said, this game knows what it wants to be, and does it in the best way possible. The feeling of the game is silly in an enjoyable way, but this can change to best fit certain parts of the game (such as when Coo dies in the 4th chapter, so sad ;_;). In my opinion, though, the best improvement from the previous game is how they handled the Overworld outside of quests. In the first one, the overworld was almost not there. It was a level select, pretty much. But in this one, you could walk around, raid Dungeons outside of quests, visit villages without the 30 seconds limit, buy gear that you couldn't afford during quests, and just generally have a good time. Then again, this game's 10\u20ac (11, including the DLC containing perhaps the best DLC section ever made, check some of my screenshots out for more information).  AND by paying 10\u20ac, you even get the first game! That's even more content for such a low price! In total, the first and the second are gonna be roughly 50-55 hours of Gameplay.

While the first game felt a bit more of a parody of the whole JRPG genre, this one feels more like they're playing it straight, while at the same time keeping their very unique and quirky style. While this game doesn't seem to feature extra modes like Evil Lord 30, Princess 30, or Knight 30, it does expand greatly upon the Hero 30; play an entire JRPG adventure in 30 seconds style, adding things like weapon crafting, global dungeons, a traversable map, collectibles and a pretty sweet castle. This game isn't quite as out there as the first, but it also feels better from a gameplay perspective, now when you go back to get certain titles or equipment, you may do so with your full party and equipment from where you are in the currently, not being restricted to items that you had on your first pass of the level. \n\nThese games have always felt more like puzzle games to me rather than JRPGs, you have to figure out how to level up, manage your money, and do it all within a certain time limit. The game gets very intense in later levels, and has an absolutely fantastic soundtrack that makes the best parts of this game shine even brighter. I would absolutely recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of JRPGs or anime, or anyone who like speed-running games. There are other modes to speak of, but I haven't played the Multiplayer yet, though the Infinite Hero mode was really fun, you basically just keep leveling up and fighting one Evil Lord after another, trying to set a high score, changing levels every 10 bosses you defeat. \n\nHonestly this game is a really fun game to just pick up and play, its levels take probably 1-5 minutes, with the longer ones being probably at least 10-15 minutes, but there are a lot of levels, and it feels good to binge play or to just do 3-4 levels at a time. The levels consist of you sprinting around a map, fighting enemies, helping people, leveling up, and trying to defeat some sort of enemy in 30 seconds, on the normal setting, time is paused in towns, and you can reset time by paying a certain amount of money to a goddess statue in town, the fee gets greater and greater each time. The story can be a bit bland/jrpg-ish when it's not being funny or having completely badass moments. The characters are likable, even if Yusha is kind of that emo jrpg protag, he's still cool, and he's only really bad if you choose to make him be bad. I highly recommend playing the first game before you play this one, there are lots and lots of references to the first game, and you would probably be missing something if you just jumped right into the second one, which should kind of be obvious, but don't worry, as I said, you get the first game free with the purchase of this one.

I saw this ages ago and did not get it. I did play the first one but the first game had plenty of problems in it (Such as quests being nearly identical to each other and not much variety in them). That was a stupid decision. This game fixes all the problems in the first game and makes it a almost perfect game. Here's how.\n\nStory:\nThere are 4 (5? I'm on Ragnarok at the minute and I don't really know if there is more.) eras to play in this game. They all have different stories. The eras are Overture, Judgement, Revolution and Ragnarock. Judgement is a kind of part 2 to Overture so it does not have a different protagonist unlike the others. I will only explain the Overture story because 1. I don't want to spoil much. 2. I don't want to waste time on a review. So overture follows the story of Yusha. A royal commando sent on a mission to destroy the Evil Lords alongside a group that contains Yashu and Guy. The Evil Lords get their hands on the Spell of Destruction. This spell makes the world end in 30 seconds. Thus the 30 second gimmick. Wow. I thought Overture had a bit more to the story that I could say without spoiling anything. Anyway over to the gameplay.\n\nGameplay:\nThis really is the highlight of the game. So basically you are hunting Evil Lords and shit. They use their Spell of Destruction to make the world end in 30 seconds. This means you only have 30 seconds to teach the Evil Lord a lesson. Each quest (level) starts off with the Godess telling you things that may help you  defeat the Evil Lord. Each Evil Lord has their own quirk. For example. The Light boss blinds the player with light every few seconds and can be defeated using some kind of dark energy. Anyway the actual gameplay. After the godess tells you shit, you need to scurry around the map and take out monsters to level up and talk to villagers. You're basically trying to level up as fast as you can and take down the evil lord before 30 seconds is up. However you can pray to the Time Godess to reset your time however it costs money to do so. There is more to the gameplay but I gotta type this quick so whoop.\n\nMusic:\nOh my god. Oh my actual god. This music. This is SO good. I have been listening to this all week. It really is a pleasure to listen to. It's basically chiptune mixed with normal stuff. It is such a good blend. There is not much I can say about the music apart from its amazing.\n\nGraphics:\nIt's pixel art. Nuff said. OH WAIT! I almost forgot about the animation parts. Okay so there are small parts of this game that are animated. These are pretty cool i guess. I mean they dont really show it off that much and the animation does not have a lot going on in it so yeah.\n\nOverall Half Minute Hero: The Second Coming is a great game and I highly reccommend the game. It is fun, addicting and...fun. So what are you waiting for? Buy it now!

I gave it a lot of time to try and enjoy it, but at a certain point I realized I was putting more effort into trying to enjoy it than I was actually enjoying it.\n\nIt isn't that it's bad necessarily, it's that it lacks all the charm that made HMH1 such an amazing experience. I don't think the designers even know what made HMH1 so good, because even as someone who played the original for over a hundred hours while aiming for top scores on the leaderboards, I can't even tell you what made it so good. It came out of nowhere, it was an amazing game, and I couldn't get enough of it. It's like a lightning strike. It was so randomly amazing that it can't even be properly dissected. It had that \"X-Factor\" that so many products claim to have, but is only ever obtained by complete accident.\n\nHMH2 plays like Marvelous AQL was trying to hit all the notes HMH1 delivered, but that's the problem. HMH1 didn't feel forced or practiced. It's like they had the right people at the right time working on the same thing, and something amazing happened. HMH2 feels forced. Everything about it just feels tedious in comparison to HMH1.\n\nIt happens in every industry. Led Zeppelin had plenty of songs, but only one \"Stairway to Heaven\", and how do you top something like that? How did they even make that? I bet they don't even know. And that's what I think HMH1 is. It's the video-game equivalent of \"Stairway to Heaven\". It's amazing and epic in every regard, the reasons that make it such a legendary experience will never be able to be fully explained, and as a result nothing that follows it will ever live up to the same experience.\n\nIt isn't that HMH2 is bad, it only suffered the misfortune of following HMH1. On its own, this game might've been a 7 or 8/10 derivative JRPG, but as a follow-up, it made me feel physically depressed to play. I know that sounds extreme, but I was so in love with HMH1, to see this happen... it's like Hangover 1 to Hangover 2, or Mass Effect 1 to Mass Effect 2. Sequels to something mind blowing rarely ever work. The game developers accidentally created something amazing with the first release, and they're going to continue to rehash it as many times as they can because life is long and they want to keep themselves employed, but this franchise will never be as good as it was when it first started.\n\nIf you didn't like HMH1, you might like HMH2 because it plays more like every other JRPG on the market than the odd whatever-the-hell-that-was that HMH1 was, but if you loved HMH1 as much as I did, this game is probably going to be a brutal reminder of why good things can't last. They rarely occur, and they're always so amazing that they can't be recreated or relived. Just have to hold out for that next moment when it feels like lightning strikes, and enjoy the hell out of it for knowing how fleeting that feeling is.\n\nI have yet to beat this game, but go back every now and then just because I do eventually want to finish it.  I never get more than a mission or two done at a time though - it definitely feels like a slog.", "timestamp_created": 1424240732, "timestamp_updated": 1511027732, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0,

It's worth sitting through those for those brilliant silly Half-Minute Hero moments though, and there are more than enough of them to justify sitting through the boring overall story.\n\nThis has a lot more features than the original game, which I've got mixed feelings about.\nClasses don't do much, but they're a nice idea. Battle formations are awesome. Searching for medals on the overworld? Eh, why not. I'm indifferent about skills and Hero Castle stuff, though I think a lot of people would probably like those. I don't know.\n\nSince you can now grind on the overworld for permanent level ups, and are allowed to keep the gear you've obtained in later quests even when redoing quests, there's never any point in strategizing as to which gear and path will let you earn the best time, as you can just come back later in the game with max levels and the best equipment, and redo the quest with no challenge. Maybe I'm being too harsh as there's a separate Time Attack mode that plays more like the original, but I just don't see the appeal of redoing story quests in a different mode.\n\nThis game is much more friendly to newcomers and casual players than the original was, and so it is the best place to pick up the series, though veterans of the original may be disappointed that it's nowhere near as challenging.\n\nStill a great game though, and I had a ton of fun with it despite all the things I've nitpicked about it. I definitely recommend both Half-Minute Hero titles to anyone who's a fan of retro console JRPGs, and since you get the first game for free with this one, my complaints are pretty much null!\n\nTLDR; Very funny and good, rant about it being easier than the first game, and new features being meh, still worth your time, buy it!", "timestamp_created": 1422153706, "timestamp_updated": 1422153706, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.561071", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14092950": {"recommendationid": "14092950", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076176913", "num_games_owned": 248, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 1975, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1423573946}, "language": "english", "review": "I miss those kind of Badassery JRPG storyline.

You spend most of the game doing quests that usually give you a 30 second time limit to complete them. It's hard to impossible to actually complete any quest in that amount of time however, so there are almost always Goddess Statues to reset the timer for a small amount of gold. Each of the 80 or so quests pretty much boils down to going to a town to find out how to solve the gimmick blocking access to the boss, solving the gimmick, then going to beat the boss... resetting the timer whenever necessary. Thankfully, a surprisingly engaging hilarious story and the occasional quest that mixes things up keeps the formula from becoming too grating.\n\nThe biggest difference between this game and the first is the world map. Instead of simply picking a quest, you actually explore with your team in true RPG fashion. You can even level up, collect gold to spend on items you may have missed during quests, and go into some dungeons free of a time limit. Best of all, your level will carry over to the quests you play, lessening the amount of grinding necessary to complete each one. Another great thing is that you can use any gear in any quest after you obtain it. The first game locked gear away making it all feel kind of pointless, but in this one, if you want to take your ultimate gear to the first quest and wreck the boss in one hit, feel free!\n\nThere's really not much more to say.

At first glance, it seemed to be just a parody : it mocked grindy RPG with cliche story. But once you delved into it you found a very original gameplay system, with lots of cool ideas. The maps were full of secrets and branching paths, and the combat system had some clever mechanics for people that wanted a challenge or wanted to find all secrets.\n\nThe Second Coming, by trying to add more stuff is now...a grindy RPG with cliche story. The super cliche plots are force fed to you through endless and pointless dialogs. The \"metagame\" added is a grindy RPG (not sped up) with linear plot, repetitive gameplay, forced backtracking to unlock all items, etc. Exactly the kind of games the first game was mocking. \n\nThe new combat features (Skills, formations, party, classes, etc...) are also completely broken. All attempts to use theses features will be constantly thwarted by the game, which reset your formations, party, equipment everytime a story event requires a single change (which is...almost always). \"Luckily\" you actually you do not have to use theses features most of the time, as brute forcing is often the way to go.\n\nUnfortunately, brute forcing can be applied to everything in the Second Coming. Most of the cleverness of the combat is gone : there are tons of items, but they don't have special attributes anymore like you could find in the first game. So you just get whatever give you the biggest stats bonus and rush. No need to be clever anymore, just go through the motions, endure the repetitive combats and you will win all missions. Even the secret titles, which used to be a challenge in the first game, are now rather straightforward and super easy to get.\n\nOn the bright side, for people who are looking for a challenge, there is a very challenging \"endless\" mode, but i doubt you will come back to it once you've finished it, since the maps are always the same.\n\nMultiplayer has also been upgraded, but since there are very few players, I've been unable to try it, which will be the case for you too if you don't have friends who own the game.\n\nOn the whole, I don't see enough good stuff in this game to alievate the bad, and I can only advise you to stick to the first game. I completed the game, but it wasnt because i enjoyed it, it was only for completion sake and to be sure i wasn't missing something....", "timestamp_created": 1413300333, "timestamp_updated":

You have several stories to go through which span an impressive plot which is told in a series of (technically) 30 second levels. The characters are colorful and the gameplay is amazingly fun. Keeping in touch with true frantic action, you must make all your choices quickly, lest those 30 seconds you have be wasted, or you could always pay the stingy Time Goddess.\n\nThe game is extremely fun, with the game keeping the pedal to the metal at all times. The story and dialogue gloriously pokes and prods fun at many tropes present in video games, from forcing you to pick a specific choice to giant robots (who doesn't love giant robots?)! This game, like its predecessor, has an overarching story that encompasses several campaigns following different heroes of different eras, all helped by the Time Goddess. \n\nThe gameplay is simple, but fun. You'll find yourself smiling as you plow through fields or Global Dungeons looking for EXP, gold, and items. During missions, you have to balance time and money, adding a strategic / tactical aspect to each and every mission. Do you plow through to the boss and risk being too weak or grind your levels until you're strong enough? Not only there, there's plenty of secrets in the game that'll keep you engaged for awhile as well.\n\nThere's also a map creation system where you can create your own maps to play and download creations of other players, to further add to the content of this game!\n\nIt also has a multiplayer function, though I've yet to try that out.\n\nOverall, it's an amazing game that is definitely worth the price tag that it has.\n\nUnfortunately for me, the Time Goddess noticed I called her stingy and has taken all my money, my shoes, and my shirt.\n\nThankfully, I still have my pants.

The half minute hero format is interesting, though! You have 30 seconds to defeat whatever evil force is threatening to destroy the world/continent/whatever. Point is, you have 30 seconds! Oh no! That's not NEARLY enough time! Well luckily you have \"The power of the goddess\" on your side! Essentially you grind for 29 seconds, run to town, and pay N*100 gold to reset the clock, where N=1. This means the first reset is 100g, the 2nd 200 and so on. The challenge shifts from simply grinding until you're sufficiently leveled (the game literally tells you \"You>Evil!\" to say you're leveled enough) to managing your resets efficiently. \nI remember a mission, mission 3 or 4, where all of the good grinding mobs were a good deal further in the level. You will not always succeed the first time through, you need to know all the parameters to the challenge before you can farm and grind effectively. \n\nAfter you defeat a boss, you usually get put back in the open world, where your level and gold revert to a sort of macro profile. You had 10000 gold and 30 levels in the challenge? Tough, you're back to your global level and gold. The good news is the next time you start a new mission, you start at your global level, so a little in-between mission grinding goes a long way. Also in between missions is my preferred time to buy gear, because there are serious penalties if you can't afford a reset during a mission. \n\nI just got explained some sort of skill system. It sounds like it boils down to grinding a certain weapon to unlock sweet super moves. None of which you can pick, combat is entirely automated all the time. Hell, if you're too overpowered, you dont even get a battle screen, you just run over the enemy and it flies off the map, team rocket style. \n\nThe writing is bleh, thank goodness you can skip it with a simple press of the start button. The goddess is this annoying money-whore who loves getting gold, so while she's essential to saving the world, she's also a stupidly annoying character. Your hero is some generic angsty dude, I dont really know what his deal is. It's not very engaging.\n\nOverall, I suggest this game to anyone who likes JRPGs and something new.

The are various additions to the game though, like a walking castle that serves not only as a base but also as a giant robot you\u2019ll use to fight overly big bosses, an overworld that you can explore for secrets without having to worry about the time and a class and skill system.\n\nThe plot is still charmingly silly, parodying classic rpgs clich\u00e9s and story patterns, packed with charismatic characters and some more serious heartfelt moments now and then. This time around there\u2019s more space for character development and a bigger emphasis on story, all while maintaining  the game\u2019s humorous mood most of the times. For those who don\u2019t want to be bothered with lengthy story though, a simple click on the action button will skip all the text.\n\nHalf-minute Hero: The second coming is a worthy successor and an upgrade in almost every way from the original, fans of the first one and newcomers to the series alike should definitively give it a try.

This game is more serious than the last one, where half the stages where filled with parodies, jokes, easter eggs and references. There are still some quite hillarious stages, but nowhere near before. Instead, you can find parodies and references in the story, maps, and even the items (really? The bike and Buster Sword from Cloud? I rather wear Vivi's outfit...).\n\nThe soundtrack is f#cking boss. I'm not even kidding. Not only it sounds way better while having the same style, but each episode of the game has multiple themes for each battle and map. And I can tell you, the music just gets better the further you go into the game.\n\nOne main problem is the difficulty...It might be that I'm a Badass, or something, but I found it a bit easy. Specially with the \"Global Level system\", and the \"Global Dungeons\". The idea is that you can level up out of the stages, so when you start your next battle, you will start at level 5 or so, instead of level 1. The Global dungeons are a good adition, but it's way TOO easy to level up in them, while searching for the loot on them.\n\nAnother trouble I find on this game, is that the story doesn't have multiple routes like the original. Further more, while in the original there where multiple ways to finish a stage, here there are not much of those. There are, though, some secret companions that are not easy to find, and usually need some backtracking to get (like Cozain, who you will need a guide to find, like me).\n\nSomething that has also been done well, are the cameos. A good amount of characters from the original can be found in here: Allied characters, the other heroes of the game, some Evil Lords...Even the main character itself! Most of them will join you in some way, and only a few of them will serve of any way on the story (like Geezer, who I'm not gonna spoil who he is, since it's quite obvious, but appears in all the chapters, helping the heroes). The new Formation system also makes the allies feel a bit more usefull than before, and now both you, allies and enemies have skills...Even though they appear out of chance, making them pretty luck-based.\n\nSomething great, and that I wanted really bad on the game, is the Map Editor. I mean, IT'S PERFECT! Now you can make your own maps, or download the maps from others, play them alone, or with friends! It makes the game last much more, and it's something that A LOT of games should have by default.\n\nWhile it took me about 14 hours to unlock most of the original Half Minute Hero, I have played this one for 20 hours, and I'm nowhere near getting everything (Dude, the Demon Maze is a nightmare...). I would totally recommend this game, SPECIALLY if you played the first one. 20\u20ac is a bit too much, though, so wait for a sale like I did. 10\u20ac or less is a good price, and you should buy it from that point. There are probably DLC's for this game, I haven't checked them yet, but you could also buy them to extend the game, if you want.", "timestamp_created": 1404043487, "timestamp_updated": 1404043487, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 26, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.730764", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10844753": {"recommendationid": "10844753", "author": {"steamid": "76561198106282123", "num_games_owned": 16, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 177, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1404506592}, "language": "english", "review": "Lots of fun and good for that video game quickie if your in a rush.", "timestamp_created": 1403811692, "timestamp_updated": 1403811692, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.485437", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10690042": {"recommendationid": "10690042", "author": {"steamid": "76561197978343854", "num_games_owned": 510, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 4077, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1446786642}, "language": "english", "review": "Play this game.

Pretty much what you would expect from playing the first game but what is different here is how the quests are bigger, theres overworld exploration, and even little dungeons you can go through without worrying about the time in between quests. The game also has roughly twice as much content in the story compared to the first. As for more gameplay you got time attack, infinite battle, multiplayer, and the custom levels you can make and play.\n\nSo about the story I can say its pretty good. Starts off from where the last game left off but this time around it parodies the RPGs around like the SNES and PS1 era with more drama and character development (similar to that one quest in the first game).

Het was een nieuw en leuk concept om de speler 30 seconden te geven om de wereld te redden. Niet alleen gaf dit het spel een snelle speelstijl en de druk om snel te presteren, maar het maakte ook voor een interessante lineup van quests die iedere keer hetzelfde doel hadden, met wat uitzonderingen, maar toch iets toevoegden waardoor het voelt als een nieuw avontuur.\n\nIk keek altijd uit naar een vervolg, en toen ik The Second Coming (A.k.a. 2) in de Steam Store zag, hoefde ik niet lang na te denken. Zonder ook maar enige kennis van veranderingen in The Second Coming startte ik het spel, en werd ik meteen begroet door een merkwaardig intro. Als beginnende speler had ik geen idee waar dit over ging, maar na wat spelen door de storyline kwam ik er snel achter. Daarover gesproken, de eerste mode die ik opstartte was NATUURLIJK de story. Je begint het spel als de aanvoerder van een commando unit genaamd Yusha, die werkt onder de koningin van het rijk, Maria. Yusha wordt in het begin vergezeld door zijn vrienden Guy en Yashu, die ook bij de unit zitten. De eerste quest is iets simpels als een dorpje redden, maar later wordt Yusha opgezadeld met het redden van de wereld. Dit moet hij doen door de zeven Elementals te verslaan die verspreid zijn over het hele land. Yusha krijgt hierbij hulp van een mysterieuze nieuwe bondgenoot, die hem helpt om de Elementals te verslaan en te vinden. Maar zonder al te veel te verklappen, krijg je na het einde van de eerste story (Ja, er zijn meerdere stories.) te zien dat er nog meer stories zijn. 6 in totaal. Met elk vele missies om te voltooien.\n\nGoed, dat was het even voor de storyline, dan over naar de gameplay. Die is eigenlijk vrijwel hetzelfde gebleven. De nieuwe toevoeging is alleen een hub world waarin het mogelijk is om te levelen voordat je een missie ingaat. Het enige minpunt hieraan is dat het verschrikkelijk langzaam gaat, en het erg herhalend wordt na een lange tijd. Gelukkig hoef je het ook weinig te doen en is de hub world alleen toegevoegd om het meer als een heel avontuur over te laten komen. Zelf vind ik dit een geweldige functie, want nu is het mogelijk om wapens die je in stadjes bij een bepaalde missie gemist hebt alsnog te kopen met het geld dat je verdient van missies en het hub world levelen. Over geld gesproken, de Golddigger Time Goddess is ook weer terug, en ze wil weer flink wat centjes verdienen aan haar nieuwe onderdaan, maar net zoals in de eerste game zal ze in ruil voor geld de tijd weer terugzetten naar 30 seconden. \n\nDe muziek in deze game is geweldig. Het geeft je iedere keer weer het gevoel dat je een geweldige battle aangaat, of in een grappige situatie terechtkomt. Het voegt echt iets toe aan de sfeer en ik hoop dat dit in een eventueel vervolg zo blijft.\n\nDus om samen te vatten, de storyline is lang, maar ook erg meeslepend, vooral vanwege sommige personages (Als je het spel speelt weet je wie ik bedoel). De gameplay is vrijwel onveranderd, maar de charm is zeker niet weg, en de muziek is geweldig! Overall geef ik deze game een 8/10 vanwege het soms wat repetitief zijn, maar verder vind ik dit een aanrader voor zowel die-hard RPG fans, en mensen die nieuw zijn in het genre.", "timestamp_created": 1403355722, "timestamp_updated": 1403355947, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10568981": {"recommendationid": "10568981", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070424953", "num_games_owned": 90, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 696, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1404485753}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game , Love the adventures and the ducks :3", "timestamp_created": 1403277586, "timestamp_updated": 1403277586, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10557474": {"recommendationid": "10557474", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028378197", "num_games_owned": 166, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2163, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482859657}, "language": "english", "review": "GOTTAGOFAST\n30 sec isn't enough to play this game", "timestamp_created": 1403256710, "timestamp_updated": 1403256710, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498640", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10544243": {"recommendationid": "10544243", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051816593", "num_games_owned": 130, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2617, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1401871841}, "language": "english", "review": "GG", "timestamp_created": 1403225465, "timestamp_updated": 1403225465, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.472171", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10396153": {"recommendationid": "10396153", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025201418", "num_games_owned": 666, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 5753, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484816442}, "language": "english", "review": "Even more brilliant than the first game to play through.

Actually anywhere from 2 to 5 minutes in practice but it still has the \"Wario Ware roleplaying game\" feel about it.\n\nWhat's kind of interesting and ambitious is that the nature of the parody is naturally running a little dry, so the game doesn't sell itself strictly on its core gimmick anymore. That was a very smart move on the developer's part, in my opinion. It doesn't strictly feel like a series of action levels emulating an RPG this time around. This game is actually a true RPG as well. You explore, grind on enemies, search for collectables, all that good stuff. Just that the original game's arcadey gameplay is the meat of the story segments and are replayable in much the same way (with the ability to turn off the advantage the RPG-side of the game offers). The story is a bit more substantial and the characters have a more coherent and central role, with the ability to set your own party and no restrictions on equipment. It's not quite as *overtly* silly as the original game, it takes itself a bit more seriously -- but not by a whole lot. A defining silly moment for me is when one of the protagonists goes inside a virtual boy game and inside the game you have to use a controller to clear a path. Trippy.\n\nThere aren't other gameplay modes besides the standard this time, but those were kinda weak additions to the original game in the first place. Instead you play through different protagonists across time and each story has a distinctly different tone or feel, ranging from deadly serious to a lighthearted Chrono Trigger-style affair. The best part to me has to be the expanded multiplayer functions  -- you can play any of the protagonists! -- and the ability to make your story maps. Being able to share through the steam workshop is a plus too. The interface is a lot better and it's a much more natural PC port than the original and doesn't suffer the same shortcomings i.e. the lag, bugs and cut features.\n\nIt's a great sequel and consider it strongly recommended if you enjoy the original. The story has a lot of continuity and connection to the original, a really surprising degree.

The first game is shorter, lighter, and a good indicator of how you'll feel about the sequel. If you liked the first game, you'll also like the sequel. If you didn't like the first one because it didn't feel enough like a JRPG, you should try this one. If you simply didn't like the first game, you won't like this one either.\n\nI'm going to write this review as though you're familiar with the first game.\n\nQuick summary:\n- Much longer than the first game. Supports multiplayer with lobbies and Community Maps. Community Maps are awesome and could add a lot of replayability.\n- Very much a sequel to Half Minute Hero. It's a JRPG/Puzzle/Action hybrid that focuses on fun, but allows for challenge.\n- Only has RPG-mode, so Evil Lord/Princess/Knight fans are out of luck. RPG-mode fans are in for a huge treat.\n- Story is more of a take on epic SNES RPGs (e.g. Final Fantasy VI) than of classic NES RPGs (e.g. Dragon Quest).\n- Story mode less arcade-y. All the half-minute quests are in the framework of a traditional overworld RPG, although quests are individually replayable with leaderboards.\n- Lots of secret equipment/party members, as well as significant post story content. Maybe a 20-40 hour game, unless you really get into score attack or user levels.\n- Lots of extra modes, notably user generated levels and infinite play modes.\n- Music, graphics (retro 16 bit), and gameplay elements are all a big upgrade over the original.\n\nFrom all this, you can probably tell if you'd like the game or not. It's definitely not for everyone. I personally loved it. I'm arbitrarily giving it a score of 9, mostly because it's a niche game and I'd understand people who find it repetitive. I'll go into much more detail now.\n\n- GAMEPLAY -\n\nLike in the original, you take control of different main characters in different eras. Unlike the original, this game plays much more like a traditional JRPG. It is huge world with a lot of text and a lot of cutscenes. You explore an overworld map, fight battles, and progress the story. You equip yourself, you choose your party members, you choose your battle formations, you can switch classes, and you can look for secrets.\n\nHow does the overworld map work? You wander around and any leveling you do contributes to your \"global level.\" Grinding this way is slow, but you do get unlimited dash. Grinding isn't necessary to beat the main game at all. As you explore, you run into areas that lock you into a subarea and start a Half Minute Quest. Your starting level is your global level and the quest plays out a lot like a quest from the original game, in which you have thirty seconds to defeat an Evil Lord before they destroy the world. Sometimes you have to trigger certain events, like finding a key or building a bridge, in order to find and defeat the boss. You can pay a money hungry goddess to reset your thirty second timer. When you finish the quest, the barriers and time limit go away and you reset to your global level. And you continue on like you were playing a traditional JRPG.\n\nThe basic game mechanics are almost exactly like the first game, except that you can see your enemies. If you're at a much a higher level than the enemy, you won't be forced into a battle screen when you touch them... you'll just automatically win. The quests are still very creative in this game and there are lots of new gimmicks (hope you don't mind solving ice puzzles or dealing with flipped controls in 30 seconds...) Some of the quests feel really epic. It's a lot of fun.\n\nIn addition to the five part story mode, there are four other modes to play.\n\nTime Attack: You can replay the quests you've unlocked from story mode. You can freely set your equipment, party, and formation to go for a high score.\nInfinite Mode: You fight an infinite number of evil lords. You go through different maps and have to kill ten evil lords that randomly spawn in the stage. After you beat ten, you move to a different stage and repeat until you can't restart the timer.\nMap Editor: Make/Share your own quests. This is pretty well done and not too hard to use. You can search for, download, and play other people's quests. Most of the highly ranked quests are really fun.\nBattle: Multiplayer mode, you compete with other people to defeat the evil lord first. There are eight different maps in this mode.\n\n- STORY -\n\nThe story is a lot richer and more serious this time around, but it still keeps its tongue-in-cheek tone. It is a continuation to the original Half Minute Hero story. There are actually a lot of callbacks to the first game. A surprising amount of familiar faces show up again as villians, heroes, or both. It's a good take on the huge RPGs of the SNES era. I enjoyed the story (especially from the second chapter onwards), but I could understand people thinking it's too slow or too cliche (even though it's cliche on purpose.)\n\nThe story mode follows three generations of heroes: Yuusha, Yushia, and Yuja. Yuusha is a play on the amnesiac, emo hero. He's even got one wing. He's captain of the royal forces on a special mission. Although he has a cold demeanor, he's a very caring guy. Yushia is a student of the Goddess school in a world ruled by the Empire. She's a bit naive and has to deal with a crazy escalating situation. Yuja is a brawn over brains kind of guy who's living in a post-apocalyptic type world that's been ruined by the gods. Each story mostly deals with saving the world within 30 seconds, but the overarching threat is different each time and each story has its own themes. Each of the heroes makes a contract with a Time Goddess who will reset time for them... for an increasingly high fee. Both main characters and supporting cast are pretty endearing.\n\nAs you can guess, this game addresses a lot of RPG tropes. You get lots of adventure, romance, betrayal, artifact collecting, and plot twists. There are evil empires, dark lords, time streams, and rivals to fight. You take on evil groups like the \"Eight Elementals\", \"The Three Generals\", the \"Dark Time Goddess\", and the \"Venus Seven.\" The creators use a lot of cliches, but they use them knowingly. The story is clearly a take on character driven SNES-rpgs, especially Final Fantasy.\n\n- PRESENTATION -\n\nThe graphics follow the original Half Minute Hero's retro look, although this time around, the style is much closer to 16-bit RPGs of the SNES era. If you like that look, you'll love the art. There are a ton of sprites and a ton of maps. Most of the main characters and villians have concept art you can collect in game. The concepts were drawn by different artists and it's fun to compare the concept to the actual sprite.\n\nThe music is really great and done by a large group of great composers. There are vocal songs this time too, which add a really epic feel.\n\n- CLOSING -\n\nI'm a huge Half Minute Hero fan and grew up playing SNES RPGs, so I really loved this game. It's not just more of the same, I'd say the developers took even bigger risks this time by trying to make a full length game. It feels like a loving, fast paced take on a great traditional RPG.", "timestamp_created": 1396935992, "timestamp_updated": 1396935992, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9759546": {"recommendationid": "9759546", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016647052", "num_games_owned": 127, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 343, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1398841157}, "language": "english", "review": "Best game in a while.", "timestamp_created": 1396926396, "timestamp_updated": 1396926396, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9756413": {"recommendationid": "9756413", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030239580", "num_games_owned": 410, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2269, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1401267831}, "language": "french", "review": "Critique en Fran\u00e7ais : Bon ben ...

Jujur gw belom nyobain yang pertama dan cuma nonton di Youtube. Game ini masih soal nyelamatin dunia dari semua Evil Demons yang muncul dan menghancurkan dunia dalam waktu 30 Detik saja. Gameplaynya yang menarik juga disuguhi dengan background music yang luar biasa bikin deg-deg-ser. Main Storynya kita bakal mainin sampai 500 tahun cerita dan bakal banyak dialog juga di game ini dan hati-hati dengan tombol enter, bakal skip dialognya dan bener-bener cepet banget. \n\nSalah satu hal menariknya adanya dukungan Oculust Rift dan Map Editor, bukan cuma Multiplayer Battle yang selalu bikin rame game ini tapi juga bisa share Map bikinan kita sendiri di steam workshop. Terus selain Multiplayer Battle, ada juga Infinite Battle dan Time Attack Battle yang bisa nyombongin hasilnya ke Leaderboards secara global.\nNgomongin soal Multiplayer, jangan tanya soal serunya, pasti seru! kalian bisa cepet-cepetan ngalahin Evil Demons ataupun Co-op. Yang nyesek sekaligus bikin seru ya siapa yang terakhir nge-kill dia dinobatin sebagai HERO! tapi, titlenya bisa aja jadi Fake Hero. \n\nHarganya $19,99? Bisa dibilang mahal tapi worth to buy.

This makes the mode extremely boring (having OP equipment makes most stages complete jokes), which is a shame; trying to get better and better times on each stage is what made the first game awesome. \n\nFurthermore, the translation is... questionable at best. Much of the original characters' charm is gone (for instance, there's a character whose entire shtick is that she tries to act dignified, winds up getting angered by something, and then tries to switch back to formal speech as if nothing had happened; in the translation, she never acts dignified, barely sounds like she's getting mad, and then says \"Yes, I would.\" Yes, I would have liked her to be localized better); literally translated names make puns unintelligible (\"Yuusha\" literally means \"hero\"... Why leave this untranslated? And there's one character whose name is a shortened version of his name in the previous game, but the names in the translation are completely different!); and \"Ojisama\" was translated as \"Geezer,\" which makes me cry.\n\nI realize I've been mostly negative, so let me say again: the core gameplay is still solid. If you treat it as a JPRG with a time-limit twist, you'll be in love.

If you are a completionist, check out the gallery and unlock artworks, videos and soundtracks by finishing the game! The only complain I have is only the music transition while fighting against the enemies while not on any mission, since it gets rather repetitive. Steam Workshop support allows map creation for increased gameplay value.\n\nFor the options, each gamepad and keyboard bindings can be customized to your liking and for the first time, occulus VR mode on a 2d game(?).\n\nExperience great soundtrack (especially the main menu!), improved battle (now you have skills, class, party and formation) and having the money-minded goddess along with your journey, HMH fans and newcomers will love it!", "timestamp_created": 1396640943, "timestamp_updated": 1396779256, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 90, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.851765", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9725224": {"recommendationid": "9725224", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995820083", "num_games_owned": 1164, "num_reviews": 640, "playtime_forever": 2728, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 938, "last_played": 1514266444}, "language": "english", "review": "Half Minute Hero 2 tries to add a lot of things to the gameplay, but not a lot of them work. You get a pilotable walking castle that only ends up slowing down the gameplay instead of being fun, and an explorable overworld that just turns the usual parody of grinding into actual grinding. The original HMH had a single Hero 30 mode that served as the main event and a few side games like the scrolling shooter Princess 30 or the actiony Knight 30, but 2 just has 5 different Hero 30 modes, and while that might appeal to some people, I thought it got old pretty fast and didn't have enough variety to justify spreading itself so thin. I would mention that if you liked HMH1's steam port's alternate art style from the 360 port then you'd be disappointed to not have it here, but that's purely hypothetical, because nobody actually liked that style. \n\nDespite all of these complaints, it's still not a bad game, just not as good as the first.

While the first one had several frantic levels to complete, this one has periods of calm to make yourself stronger at a slower rate, before you gain temporary levels at a rapid rate in quests.

You can actually position everyone and give them little orders, and you can also select a skill to randomly fire upon landing a hit.\n\nThe story this time around is highly engaging. There is less humour in the first chapter of this adventue, but it makes up for this lacking with a web of character relations and situations.

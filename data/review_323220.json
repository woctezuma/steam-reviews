Everything from its crushing difficulty, to the lack of any type of story! Its amazing how such a small team could make such a great game! SO let me quick list pros and cons for people who are reading this review.\n\n\n               ::PROS::\n-VERY diffcult\n-Interesting Areas\n-Pixel art, though overdone, is very nice in this game\n-Multiplayer to play with your friends, whether its local or online\n-Great soundtrack  (shoutouts to the forest and rift fight themes)\n-Great, although small, playerbase\n-Updates are large and full of bug fixes\n-Wide variety of enemies! (AKA no reskins)\n-New Game+ is always nice\n-Satisfying gameplay\n-Multiple Classes each with their own unique abilities...except rogue....I'll get to her in a minute...\n\n               ::CONS::\n-The only reward **really** after dying is the increase in your skill\n-Overhead swing weapons aren't class specific. Meaning that you have no character bonuses making them hard to use\n-Now onto the Rogue... This character is basically a Jack Of All Trades. This specific character is overpowered as hell! Everything from the Dodgeroll to the ability to move with the bow. The Rogue has the greatest variety of skills and can successfully shoot and dagger his way to victory. This may have been the intentional, but once you start dodgerolling then shooting arrows you have this slight taste of this greater moveset this character could have had. Or more importantly how every other character is lacking in tactical moves... Not even to mention how powerful an endgame rogue's bow is! To really understand what I mean you'll need to play as the Rogue.\n-Saving feature is not really something I've seen anyone use\n-An utter lack of healing items. This game is meant to be difficult but being thrown a bone would be nice.\n-A small playerbase, though good in some areas, means that the online lobbies are generally empty.\n-No type of ingame guide to monsters(You can't see monsters' stats for example)\n-Small development team means updates are few and far betwee, meaning that the game(after it's been beaten) fails to hold my attention\n-Cooking is underutilized\n-Act 3 is a difficulty spike, and Act 4, though freakin awesome, is a cakewalk afterwards..sometimes\n-Unspoken prerequisites, what I mean is that you \"need\" certain abilities for certain Acts or else its extremely difficult lemme quick list (im not covering the secret acts, although they are the worst offenders. I wish that the levels reflected their main elements better) :\n          ACT 1: You fumble around getting pwned until you get to Act 2\n          ACT 2: Although possible without. It is extremely difficult without poison resistance\n          ACT 3: You fumble around getting pwned until you get to Act 4\n          ACT 4: What? No boulder protection? You're screwed without it\n-The game is dark, and not in a good way...\n-Artifacts are cryptic, This may have been the point. But I hate looking on the wiki for how to get some of these\n                ::NITPICKS::\n-The full soundtrack isn't available without going through your game files\n-Shops are useless in the endgame\n-Mentioned this already, but Swing weapons don't have place with any character's abilities\n\n      I know that there are more cons than pros, but I criticize because I fucking love this game, I highly HIGHLY recommend it", "timestamp_created": 1514076722, "timestamp_updated": 1514083265, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38597871": {"recommendationid": "38597871", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083348315", "num_games_owned": 169, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 7694, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 632, "last_played": 1514232835}, "language": "english", "review": "Roguelike platformer w/ RPG elements.\nThis game is by far one of my favourites, for its type, of all time.

The rarity of these items match well with expectations of the item, [spoiler] like the Celtic Ring which can reveal ALL hidden enemies in each level. [/spoiler] Some of the items however, like the Mace, Warhammer, Battleaxe and those other misc. weapons are decent but it doesn't really fit any class and acts more as a \"substitute\" weapon for anything (like having Lifesteal on a Mace so you can switch to the Mace to regain bits of health before going to the next level).\n\nThe monsters are especially amazing and they all have their subtly unique counterparts, like the Ghouls and the Archers in the forest, while some of them are completely new like the crawling hands in the Catacombs. None of the normal monsters seem to be overpowered and they all have their own strengths and weaknesses which you can easily exploit or literally pulverize your way through.\n\nThe bosses are pretty good, but for me it just seems like the Catacombs bosses are [b]E X T R E M E[/b] OP. I was having a hard time fighting the abomination with tendrils and flesh orbs, especially the zombie dragon with maxed Berserker and Fist Weapons using this other fist weapon that looked like knuckles (forgot what they were called), and I was rapidly punching and spamming X but my Death Protection got used and I died before it died and I got a bunch of 8-12 and occasional 23 dmg crits on the boss. Although, I can't really say this is the game's issue but personal since they are SUPPOSED to be harder as the levels progress, I just felt like the only boss I could kill was the Sorcerer.\n\nThe level designs are randomly generated, which is always nice, and even some of the levels will literally try to kill you immediately by spawning in spikes with an arrow trap above you or having a boss blocking the only way to progress through the level, or something crazy, and for me personally, even the Catacombs with those PRESSURE SPIKES (although this could be avoided with Light Feet) and bosses. But overall, level design is amazing, it never gets boring.\n\nAlso is a GREAT experience with multiplayer, but every player does start out with 20 less max HP than in solo because, multiplayer at 100 or 80 HP start is just not okay. The only issue I have with MP is teamkilling by THROWING BOXES, BARRELS, AND CRATES at your teammates and literally just getting them killed. I don't know if it's intentional or not but it's kind of annoying.\n\nAs far as the game goes with level progression (character-wise), every ability when unlocking them holds some real significance like Wildling's animal stance level 1 can give you some breathing room, Rogue acrobatics can let you easily steal from the merchant and dodge if paired with Stealth. Killing bosses is always rewarded with a garunteed level progression, but it does not stack on top of the experience you gain the next level, or in other words, you can only gain 1 character level in each level, so you're not constantly getting 2-3 levels and becoming an overpowered beast that's obliterating everyone's innards into outards. \n\n[b]TOO LONG DIDN'T READ[/b]\n[b]tl;dr This game is an amazing, simple, but tough platformer with unique monsters and bosses. You can play it alone, or you can play it with friends which makes it all the more better. Level design is good, but can improve by not trying to trap and destroy the player's chances (but rarely does it happen).

It's deceptively simple but almost impossible to master, and with enough complexity that it has extraordinary replayability. The different character classes are all unique with their own starting equipment, stats, and abilities, which allows for a wide variety of play styles. Want to run around all the enemies and attack from a distance? Be an acrobatic rogue and roll, jump, and climb around to your hearts content. Want to just brute force melee everything? Be a berserker wildling and solve all of your problems with fists. Finding a method that works for you is important because the game can be mind numbingly difficult. \n\nThe games mechanics are very classic rpg and rogue-like: simple melee, ranged, and magic attacks with stats that control each; a variety of potions, scrolls, and magic spells; and a plethora of different weapons, armor, and gear, most of which has some sort of magic property. However, the most notable feature that makes it a classic rogue-like is that preserving health is critical. If you're not careful you can lose a lot of health fast, and healing is infrequent. In addition, the enemies get much harder with each subsequent stage, even relative to any stat boosts from leveling up and better gear. This is why after over 500 hours of play time logged and a death count in the thousands, I've beaten the game exactly three times. \n\nHowever, skill is only about three quarters of having a successful run, and the rest is luck. The randomness of the loot can be one of the most challenging aspects of the game. Skill is critically important: just through muscle memory, good reflexes, and learning the attack patterns of the enemies, it should theoretically be possibly to beat the game with no gear and unarmed. That being said, better gear make the game infinitely easier. Besides boosting your stats, one of the most interesting aspects of the gear system are the magic properties of the items. Most weapons and armor have some sort of magic property, the effects of which range from detrimental (such as cursed items, although the curse can be lifted, or super speed boots, which make it nearly impossible to have any sort of precision to your movement), to useless or niche (such as underwater breathing, or heavy boots), to helpful (such as double or triple jump, dealing additional poison or fire damage, or having a familiar that fights with you). There are also some that are ridiculously over powered or way more useful. Things like life steal and homing arrows make the game a breeze, but are proportionally rarer. \n\nCo-op is fantastic with this game, and while I haven't played much online, my roommate and I play couch co-op all the time. It is a little easier with more people, although starting stats and health are slightly nerfed when playing with more than one person to make it more balanced, and the quantity of loot stays the same and must be split amongst the party.  \n\nIt's hard not to keep raving about this game. It's strange to me to think that I've put so much time into such a simple game, but the simplicity is part of the appeal. Everything about it is so minimal and uncluttered, while retaining and refining to a point the things that make a great rogue-like. The developers have done an amazing job with this game and keeping it updated. The next update should be the end game content and the game will move out of early access. I can't wait to see what they do, and hopefully the official release will expose more people to this game.", "timestamp_created": 1511825055, "timestamp_updated": 1511825055, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "37674003": {"recommendationid": "37674003", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062858786", "num_games_owned": 56, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1549, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474403283}, "language": "french", "review": "Vagante est un bon jeu RPG plateforme pixels.

The game features roguelike elements, mixing that in with 2D platforming mechanics. The combat is fast paced, movement is precise, and the RNG is offset by a demand for skill rather than luck. Your gear still determines how easy you really have it, but if you want to make it far and beat the game you'll need to hone your skills with the mechanics. I like that personally, it's a different take on the roguelike genre and this game in particular executes that very well.\n\nIt's a game that knows what it wants to be, and is almost complete.

It is very roguelike at its core. Death is the end, and it comes easy. However, I find the difficulty to not be very frustrating. After I die, which is practically inevitable, I am eager to begin again and see how far I can go.\n\nBosses are difficult, until you start to figure out their patterns. Some bosses will remain difficult, even if you do know the patterns. Difficulty also very much depends on the luck of the draw when it comes to loot, but that is half the fun! Especially when you are rushing to get it before your friends.\n\nThe developer intends on working some balance issues out in the future, which I believe is needed. The wildling is horribly underpowered right now, while the rogue is perhaps the easiest way to progress through the levels.\n\nOverall, this game is wonderful.

And also classes really differ alot from eachother, like with the mage you have to remember to keep your distance and with the knight you keep your enemy at bay, wich makes each class an overall different expirience and makes the game diverse and creative.

randomization, a nice pool of unique items and basic Role-Playing leveling mechanics.\n\nOverpriced considering the low amount of randomization as a whole, the very poor developer support and straight up broken controller support. The game also likes killing players instantly with traps that are barely visible, perhaps the developers are underaged. The only unique strength of the game is it actually has online co-op.\n\nIt still suffers from the primary issues of these kinds of low-end Rogue-like games; it does not have enough randomization or polish to compete with the price range it is sold in. There are multiple other Rogue-likes you could buy which are better designed and hold far more replayability then this one while costing exactly the same. It doesn't help how awkward the combat can be as well, while the controls are tight in a very satisfying way; the actual method in which players need to land hits using melee is straight up clumsy and unrefined.\n\n\nIt's also to be noted how blatantly the game rips off the mechanics of Spelunky. If the developers were so desperate to save brain power by just stealing another games system instead of making up their own; where did they put all that saved energy into.

Highly recommend.\n\nThe Rogue-Like elements are done well. You will recognise areas after a while, but the structure and placement methods keep the same areas feeling different for each run. Though the levels can feel a bit short at times, they are always interesting to navigate and explore.\nCombat is satisfying. Button mashing will get you killed, but properly executed tactics are rewarding. In 78 hours of gameplay (at time of writing) I have rarely felt like a death was cheap. Every hit taken, or missed attack is down to my own error, not glitchy hitboxes/mechanics.\nCharacter diversity doesn't feel limited by the chosen class. The, current four, classes each have their own perks, but there is no pressure to play a specific way or use a certain weapon.\nItem diversity.

There are some functions (D-Casting for the mage, shrines, effects on armor and weapons) that you have to either wiki, look in discussions, or figure out.\n\nHOWEVER, since I had this game gifted to me by a friend, I have fallen in love with it.

The item generation is in the ballpark of mixed Diablo and (if you played it) the mobile roguelike Pixel Dungeon.\nThe multiplayer is still populated (not extremely populated, but every time I've gone there is at least one game running. It helps to have friends who play too.)\n\n\n[Edited lines ahead]\nHaving completed the availiable content somewhere between 70 and 80 hours, I've still played another 15ish hours and still like the game.

The two elements combine to make one of the most enjoyable gaming experiences I know of.\n\nA lot of people seem to dislike how punishing the game can be. For instance, you might spend 7 hours on a single run only to stumble into a spike trap and instantly die at full health. With perma-death, this is definitely frustrating. But in the age of the Quick Save, where any mistake in a game can be undone by reloading a save point from two minutes earlier, I think it's pretty exhilerating to play a game where actions have consequences.\n\nOther people complain about the how you can have bad luck on a run and end up with bad items, low stats, and at a severe disadvantage.This is also something that happens, but again, I see this as a strength to the game rather than a shortcoming. If I got the ideal items every time and had the eprfect skill-tree, it wouldn't be much of an rpg... I might as well be playing any other 2D platformer.\n\nOther reviews will discuss the excellent artwork and gameplay, but I just wanted to offer a counter to some of the negative comments.

There are elements to this game that are unbelievably satisfying: Mastering the controls, building up your character from scratch, defeating the bosses, exploring the levels- this game takes much of what makes the rogue-like genre likable and turns it up. HOWEVER, this game suffers from another aspect of rogue-likes in too much of an extreme- that randomness has the ability to cripple and kill your character at any time with very little foresight or control from the player. Here's a few examples:\n\nTraps\nReading through other reviews, traps get a lot of attention, and for good reason- there is no reason for a small misstep or bad RNG to kill a player immediately. While traps do encourage care from the player, the fact that elements outside of your control (Such as being knocked by enemies, or not being able to see an area below you) can immediately end the game is frustrating in the extreme. Traps can be fun, but not when so much of a player's success is dependent on something that can instantly kill you. If the penalty for traps was less brutal, I'm sure they would be fine, but as it stands, that's not the case.\n\nPotions and Scrolls\nOh man. There's an issue with giving a player a huge toolbox but not letting them know what the tools are. In Vagante you find scrolls and potions, but (with some exception) unless you use them, you don't know what a certain color scroll or potion will do (and they change colors every game). While scrolls are generally positive, and using them can simply mean wasting an effect, potions are a serious gamble: poison potions can slowly kill you, and some potions will permanently reduce your stats. Knowing what your scrolls did in advance (because some scrolls can be used to identify other items and potions) would hugely reduce the random aspect of potions, but, again, that isn't how it stands. In most cases, you are left with a huge arsenal of potions and scrolls with little to do but let them take up your limited inventory space. \n\nCursed and Negative Items\nSimilar issue to the potions and scrolls, but a little less extreme. Equipping a cursed item means you can't unequip it. Some items severely ruin your stats, making you extremely weak, or slow, or etc. etc. Why they wouldn't remove cursed items so that players could actively decide what tradeoffs they wanted to make with their items? I'm not sure, but it sucks. Cursed items is a lot less of a concern than other items on this list (being that they don't appear that often), but it's another un-fun element of gambling added to the mix. \n\nDifficulty Curve\nIn Vagante, you progress through a dungeon, a forest, a catacomb, and some sky islands. I truly believe that the first area of the game is the most fair- the enemies are predictable and simple, and they are never in overwhelming quantities or deal overwhelming amounts of damage. If you get hurt by these guys, you know it's you own fault. That's not at all the case with later enemies, who are in higher concentrations, deal more damage, take more damage, and worst- they can stun you or grab you with little warning. If the designers were looking for fairness, they might consider changing one of those variables at a time, but not all of them. While I imagine a more fair game would have a linear rising slope of challenge, the way it is now looks is like an exponential degree of difficulty.\n\nLeveling Your Character\nVagante tries to make interesting tradeoffs in its designs: Do I pass up this enemy, and not get experience or gold? or do I fight this enemy, and risk taking damage? The thing is, most of the time it doesn't make sense to take on enemies, especially as the game goes on. If the only goal is to reach the end of the level, and the only thing preventing you from doing that is taking damage, why risk the additional dangers? An easy fix for this would be to force players to confront enemies before making it to the end of each level, but the game has no incentive to do so, especially with it's current imbalance in favor towards it's enemies.

But much like many games on steam, this game has been in Early Access for two and a half years. So this is just criticism for the designers of the game and those curious of this game's value. \n\nWith that said, I do not recommend this game to gamers who are used to the quality of movement/mechanics of a game like Rogue Legacy or recently Dead Cells. \n\nVagante has a lot of potential to be something special, but it lacks gestalt. In other words, the mechanics of the game don't all work together in a way that is overall satsifying. It's strength is possibly the art, and sound. But the gameplay mechanics are all over the place. \n\nFor instance, when you die, you get absolutely nothing. Cool, perma death. But this is an RPG that \"appears\" to place high value on progression with a minimalistic skill \"tree.\" Those don't really go together unless somehow the player is able to progress their character even though they're dying (again going to reference Dead Cells). Or like Rogue Legacy, the player gets something different on their next run that mixes it up a bit. \n\nMultiplayer technically works, but it was humorous at how ridiculously easy it was for us to die. The most exciting things were getting new loot/gear, etc. and then my fiend and I would die and lose it all. Not exactly fun when you do that several times in a row, and feeling jipped because you died as a result of not being able to make a jump that should be extremely easy to pull off. The jumping in this game isn't consistent nor fluid. \n\nI would like to see this game focus less on the procedurally generated levels and more on the core game, getting maybe 8-10 solid levels/themes built that are fun to play, before going into generating content that doesn't really feel much different than the other generated levels. Once those levels' themes and \"hooks\" are established, then I'd say you could generate variations of those levels. \n\nAnyway, best of luck to the developers as they finish up this game.

[/h1]\n\nWhere do I start with this game? It's remarkable. There are so many good things about it, that it would be easier to just tell you what's wrong with it and end the review here by saying \"Nothing\". Unfortunately that wouldn't be a very useful review so I'll tell you what to expect from this game, since sadly, reviews have turned into people telling their personal story instead of what the game is like, what makes it good/bad, and why you should or should not get it. \n\n[h1] Graphics [/h1]\n\nThe game utilizes the classic retro sprite graphic look, and as someone who grew up on NES, this is something I can never get sick of. To be honest, given the games engine, the way the words are designed in addition to the enemies, etc, I think the game would actually look kind of bad if it tried to go for realistic graphics.\n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1]\n\nThis game plays like Castlevania had a baby with Dark Souls, and Castlevania had the recessive gene. You're going to walk side to side, and jump up and down platforms in order to get to the next level, where you're treated to a measly 4 hp out of around 80. There are 3 classes (People say 4? Maybe I haven't unlocked the 4th, so I can't speak to it) The Knight, The Rogue, and the Mage. The knight seems to have higher HP and higher defense, but has a slower swing of the sword. The rogue has a fast dagger stab, and can use a bow. The mage has the least amount of HP, and has a very weak melee attack, or as far as I can tell, an infinite amount of uses on their casting. \n\nFor me, the rogue class seems the best, although the mage can be fun too. I find the knight to be very boring. \n\n[h1] What do you do? [/h1]\n\nA horse and carriage walks up, and you select your class, and he jumps out of the carriage. You go inside the dungeon and you explore it searching either for the next door out, treasure chests, bosses (there seems to be 2 bosses on each level, and are optional, but do carry the keys to treasure chests), and then you move on to the next level. The combat is very good and responsive (I read a review saying the opposite and I wonder if perhaps it was an old review, because I found the game to be perfect in terms of responsiveness. \n\nThe game is also extremely challenging, and it doesn't hand you anything. As far as I can tell, the only thing that gives you any health, is the 4 HP you get by sitting at the fire in between levels, so be very careful and plan every attack to the T. It's because of this, that this game reminds me of Dark Souls. \n\nOverall, this game is wonderful, and I think you would be foolish not to buy it if you're a fan of roguelikes. The only thing that does bug me about the game is the fact that I have no idea how the title is pronounced.

roguelike concept is super hurt by how difficult it is to control your character. Most of the movements you make are clunky, and a great deal of combat is managing the awkwardness of your character, rather than maneuvering around the enemies.\n\nAdditionally, it seems (from my limited experience of the first two levels and about 50 deaths) that most of the game play elements are designed for long term play; identifiable items w/curses possible, random loot with interesting magic properties, etc. Except that this really works against the roguelike theme when at any time you might have a boulder auto kill you. Yes, I understand that there's a \"git gud\" factor, but the point I'm trying to make isn't that it *can't* be done, but that it's not *fun* to get good. \n\nTake Caveblazers as a counter point and very similar game (which is much uglier). When I die in Caveblazers, there's no mistaking in my mind that I died because I didn't play well. Even with spikes I often blame myself rather than the game. In Vigante when I die I feel like chucking my keyboard, because my character didn't do what I was trying to get him to do, often not turning to attack or jumping the wrong direction or not enough.\n\nIf I were to improve the game, I would make the character control muuuuch more responsive.

A lot fo thought went into this early-access game. There are a few issues that make it unplayable for me. \n\n1) The visuals are very difficult for a 40+ gamer like myself. There's not enough on-screen contrast to see what is happening, especially with the type of pixel art that was chosen. Adjusting the brightness and scaling does little to help. The  (game ending!) traps on the floor feel unfair, because they are impossible to see.  Most of the time I feel like I am guessing what is happening on screen. It's not a fun or rewarding feeling.\n\n2) A lack of tutorial is a major issue, especially considering how there is zero explanation given in-game on how to play.\n\n3) The controls often feel unresponsive. I understand that it's trying to limit the speed of my attack, but it feels excessive and sluggish. A 25% increase in game speed would make a huge difference. \n\nThese issues make Vagante less playable and enjoyable than the far inferior Bard's Gold. Not because it's not well thought out, but because Vagante is repeatedly vague and confusing.\n\nI have no qualms with a game being difficult.

The controls are super, super tight, and each class feels unique and enjoyable.  There is a wide variety of randomly-generated weapons, items, and armor, which lends to the \"Rogue\" feel, and the procedurally-generated dungeons offer a nice mix-up each time you play.\n\nSome nitpicks: \n- The endgame content was, at the time of writing, a bit sparse.   The caves and forest, and to a lesser extent, their \"locked path\" alternatives, were both excellent and filled with lots of variety and nooks to explore.  The flooding forest tower is a really neat level as it adds some extra difficulty.  The cave ruins could use more enemy types and some balancing.  The forest ruins are unbelievably challenging, filled with all kinds of traps.\n- However, the Rift (and the Factory) are both large, mostly empty spaces.  There's not much to them, at the moment.\n\nThese are just nitpicks, though, as I understand the game is still in Early Access, and there's lots more balancing and content to come, I'm sure.

Despite having only four character classes, the build variety is good; learning to use the items that the RNG gives you at each chest, and figuring out the tricks to beat each boss are both very satisfying processes.  Play careful and learn the game, but experiment: try bringing various objects to the exit; try out all of the shrines; try to get away with robbing the shop (hint: certain builds and equipment make this easy).  Learn not to take stupid risks and unnecessary damage, because it adds up.  Every class can be good.  Please note that even though the game is still in 'early access', it currently feels like a complete roguelike.\n\nThe game is detailed.  There are interesting environmental interactions of involving pushable blocks, elemental attacks, spikes and other factors.  To end the review, here are just two examples (minor spoilers):\n\n1. As a Mage, I was running from an aggrivated shopkeeper.  I jumped over a pit of spikes, and worried he would clear it and keep chasing me, so I used the basic ice spell just before he could land on safe ground with me - he froze solid and fell straight onto the spikes.\n\n2. In multiplayer, I was playing as a Knight while my friend played a Rogue.  She was new to the game, and ran under the dragon boss as it used its downward slam attack.  They both fell into water, inside a semi-enclosed U-shape open at the top.  My friend was panicked, but quickly realised that the dragon couldn't breathe fire underwater.  The water drained a little with every attempted fireball.

I binded my controls as much as I could to fix it, but I couldn't 'descend'. The buttons are very, very confusing. Not what I would normally expect. I just can't play without a controller. But they make it impossible with one.\n\nBUUUUT...\nIF I could assign the controls, I would actually say it would be really fun! If it wasn't so confusing, odd button choices weren't made, then... I would for sure enjoy it.\n\nThe introduction(?) to it, with a beautiful forest... Yeah, it's lovely. It really is. It hyped me for the game ahead. So... the graphics made it pretty good!\n... uhh... yeahhh. I feel like people are gonna hate on me for these weird controls but they felt weird to me. So! I'd recommend to anybody who can get used to the controls...", "timestamp_created": 1491251954, "timestamp_updated": 1491251954, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30874769": {"recommendationid": "30874769", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002380519", "num_games_owned": 268, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 82, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488993677}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0441\u044b\u0440\u0430\u044f.", "timestamp_created": 1491047832, "timestamp_updated": 1491047832, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.362552", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30845685": {"recommendationid": "30845685", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041816605", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2324, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 34, "last_played": 1513315265}, "language": "brazilian", "review": ":D caras... nao sei vcs mas para min isso e um dark souls 2d muito show 20/10 top foda mesmo... mais que recomendado, e estreitamente nessario, e muito viciante tambem.... nao muito vai, mas vc passa boas horas jogando, se tiver amigos ai que o jogo rende hora.( ;-; mas se for um isolado da vida que nem eu e legal jogar tambem). s2 s2 s2", "timestamp_created": 1490930811, "timestamp_updated": 1490930811, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30805882": {"recommendationid": "30805882", "author": {"steamid": "76561198282497702", "num_games_owned": 84, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 363, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506147326}, "language": "english", "review": "first impression is, it is as fun as spelunky while feeling more like a a jrpg like dragon quest or final fantasy. the world it creates so vital to the core of the game all the while being virtually non existent by not really having a story. so far i think it is the greatest rogue lite i have played no it is not dwarf fortress or unreal world but it has surprising depth for a game that is some where between a Zelda or a monster world. but that being said i wish the classes differed more then equipment that is inter changeable and i will just put out a recommendation since it is in early access and i payed full price why not have the rogue class attack downwards likethe little kid in the nes classic whomp em you know just press down and anything beneath you get wounded. it just feels a little silly to have such deadly enemies then have them get stuck under your feet and the slime's deal damage and you don't and it's just silly. other then that i think it is one of the best games i have played in a long time and highly recommend it.", "timestamp_created": 1490756342, "timestamp_updated": 1490785173, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30778276": {"recommendationid": "30778276", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995186478", "num_games_owned": 197, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 782, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495999290}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is really hard but is lots of fun the more people and controllers you have.\n\nTeam work is key, watch out for traps. \n", "timestamp_created": 1490642113, "timestamp_updated": 1490642113, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30730983": {"recommendationid": "30730983", "author": {"steamid": "76561198200513629", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3896, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 657, "last_played": 1514359638}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is a game that I bought and enjoyed.

There's a lot to enjoy, and for the most part it captures that feeling of adventure and permanent consequence well. It makes a really great first impression. But I think there are too many faults that hold it back from being enjoyable in the long term:\n\n[h1]Hitboxes are all wrong[/h1]\nFor example, rods don't have anywhere near the range they appear to in their attack animation. Frequently you will miss hitting enemies even though the animation suggests that you should have hit them. This happens for upward swings of a sword as a knight as well, for instance. In a game where each mistake is brutal, these details matter. You miss an enemy due to shoddy hitboxes, and are then punished for it with hitpoint damage that is nigh impossible to recover. A difficult game is fine, but not when many mistakes are not your own.\n\n[h1]Risk is discouraged[/h1]\nEach level has a boss that is significantly tougher than the other enemies in the level-- in most cases, tougher than the entire level itself. The payoff for beating a boss and using their key to open a bonus chest is minor; two potions and a weapon seems to be the norm. Most of the time these potions are not beneficial, and the weapon is almost certainly not suited to your character class. The potential benefit to beating these bosses is so low in comparison to the damage you will likely take, that it's usually best to skip them. I've found there to be glitches sometimes where the boss will despawn! But usually, once you encounter them, you'll want to rush though the level to the end so you can escape.\n\nThis is a running theme through the game, where the best strategy is also the most boring: run through the level to the end. (This is much more of a problem in the later levels though.) This is not helped by the fact that the Level Up choices you get are all pretty useless. A stat bonus of +1 in this game does very little, and most of the special ability options are only somewhat beneficial. You require EXP to level up, which in turn requires killing enemies. In theory you'd think this would make a nice choice to take on more risk killing enemies for additional EXP. But in reality, after the first couple of Level Ups, you'll have the most important abilities and taking on further risk is just not worth it.\n\nWhenever I play this game, I try to play it the fun way: killing lots of enemies. Not all of them, mind you. In the end, after the first couple of levels, I really have no choice except to run through them because [b]there's no reward the game will give me that is worth the risk of staying and fighting[/b]. Even if you find good loot, nothing will recover your health unless you get lucky with a healing potion or healing wand.\n\n[h1]Recommendation[/h1]\nI feel lukewarm about recommending this game. I can't honestly say it's good, despite the great first impression it has. Long term enjoyability matters to me in a game, and this game doesn't do it for me. It feels too unfair (i.e. bad hitboxes), and not rewarding enough (i.e. risk not rewarded).\n\nIt's quite possible to fix my complaints in the development of the game, but I doubt it will happen. The devs have found the shoddy hitboxes acceptable since I first bought the game, and apparently don't see fit to correct that. Seems like a pretty fundamental thing to me, and since they haven't bothered to fix it, I don't have faith that this game will ever improve enough to overcome its flaws.", "timestamp_created": 1488372348, "timestamp_updated": 1488372375, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 46, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.734263", "comment_count": "6", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30252306": {"recommendationid": "30252306", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002728160", "num_games_owned": 268, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 882, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512344181}, "language": "english", "review": "Spelunky meets classic roguelikes, with a bit of Dark Souls and Zelda thrown into the mix.", "timestamp_created": 1488334330, "timestamp_updated": 1488334330, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30232367": {"recommendationid": "30232367", "author": {"steamid": "76561198318503893", "num_games_owned": 18, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 285, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484600409}, "language": "english", "review": "I honostly do not like Vagante, its a simple and repetetive boring slog through procedreal generated worlds that feel too similar to have any sort of true replayability, but before I get into the negetives lets look at some of the positives. \n\nVagante has some very neat ideas for what it is, all the classes and spells are creative in some regards my favorites being the rougue and wilding which really push your abilities and challenge you. The gameplay feels smooth, the menues are easy to navigate and its pretty easy to get used to the controls. \n\n...That might be the end of it. \n\nUnfortanatly Vagante also has a wide variaty of problems with how it makes its characters despite them being so well built...as bases at least. What I mean is that these characters feel like bare bones representations of what could be a better start to the game. When you start, you have almost nothing, or at least for the wilding and rougue. Yes, I do know of how you are able to use one free point to unlock a new ability, abilities that can be further upgraded afterwards using the same points which are gained after leveling up, my problem is that the game makes you work for abilities that seem necessary. For example, the rougue has the rolling ability and the ability to move while shooting their bow which can be unlocked. However, I argue that the rolling should not only be immediatly available to you, but that it should also be given to all the characters. Rolling is increadibly useful in this game and I argue more importent the the primary weapon of the bow. Avoiding enemy projectiles and melee attacks by constantly jumping over them in a repetative pattern is not enjoyable, but rolling past them and avoiding their shots do. It adds a little complexitiy to the fighting, now by no means is the fighting in anyway complex in fact its pretty dull, but it was something and that something was something I thought should have been given across all the playable characters. \n\nNext, shooting while moving...why cant I have this at the very beggining? What kind of game is this where enemies are constantly moving, approaching me at a fast pace, and all I can do is sit there doing nothing? It doesn't compliment the level design, often a wall will block your shot so you will need to move, enemies will be above you but OH you can't jump or look up until, what, 2 levels in? Maybe the enemies are approaching me fast but oh no I can't move my lazy butt says I can't shoot arrows while moving backwards in a straight line. It makes the bow seem useless since often there isn't even enough space to shoot. A major problem for the Rougue. \n\nNow, the levels are boring. Im sorry but after 4 hours of playing through the first 3 levels and dying after the 3rd I just can't stand it. Sure you mey say, \"Ugh, just get better nerd and you'll see all the rest of the levels\"...but for a game that promotes proceedreal generating and replayability, should those first few levels not have some variaty and better design? Maybe make it a lush green field that goes into the cave, maybe replace the 2nd area (the forest) with the 1st (the caves) because its so drab and boring to just stare at that for 4 hours. \n\nYou know what else is boring? The combat!\n\nIts so simple, dodge, hit, dodge, hit, dodge. I mean the game has no variaty, again adding rolling to all characters and making it immediatly available could really spice it up, most enemies are too simple, they stab, and they're open. Sure this is in the first area but...the first area is 3 levels long, I expect something more like how bout less simple bandits and maybe a horde of tiny dragons that spew fire! How bout add lasers to the flying eyeball...things. I don't know but after maybe level 1 or 2 I expect more then a bandit and a flying eye that does nothing. \n\nAnd sure you may argue, well upgrading your abilities is importent to this kind of game, and I agree. But, im saying you should start me at the right point to start upgrading, between so overpowered it can kill the final boss and so weak I die in one hit kay?\n\nFinally, this game is unfair in some respects. Or at least, with the campfires, which only heal 10 HEALTH. I mean granted, its a hard game, its your mistakes, deal with it. But when I complete a stage, I want to feel motivated not discouraged. A measaly 10 health is not going to be enough to make me charge back in. \n\nI can see why so many people love this game, but its just not for me.", "timestamp_created": 1488249576, "timestamp_updated": 1488692508, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.435067", "comment_count": "8", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30223205": {"recommendationid": "30223205", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015460287", "num_games_owned": 285, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 6794, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496211699}, "language": "french", "review": "Best game roguelike ever !", "timestamp_created": 1488213434, "timestamp_updated": 1488213434, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30212003": {"recommendationid": "30212003", "author": {"steamid": "76561198195060118", "num_games_owned": 32, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 5021, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 48, "last_played": 1513231721}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uac8c\uc784 \ud3c9\uac00 - 4/5\n + \ubca8\ub7f0\uc2a4\ud654\ub41c 4\uac1c\uc758 \uc9c1\uc5c5, \uba40\ud2f0\uc2dc \uc2dc\ub108\uc9c0 \ud6a8\uacfc.\n + \ub530\ub85c \uc54c\ub824\uc9c0\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740(\ud29c\ud1a0\ub9ac\uc5bc\uc5d0 \uc5c6\ub294) \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud50c\ub808\uc774 \ubc29\uc2dd\uacfc \uc5ec\ub7ec \ud14c\ud06c\ud2b8\ub9ac.\n + \uc544\uc774\ud15c(\ud3ec\uc158, \uc2a4\ud06c\ub864, \uc7a5\ube44 \ub4f1)\uc744 \ubbf8\ud655\uc778\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\uc5ec \uc2e0\uc911\ud55c \ud50c\ub808\uc774 \uc694\uad6c.\n + \ub9f5 \uc5c5\uc801\uc5d0 \ub530\ub978 \uce90\ub9ad\ud130\uc640 \uc5ec\ub7ec\uac00\uc9c0 \ud2b9\uc131\ub4e4 \uac1c\ubc29.\n + \uc624\ub798 \uc804\uc5d0 \ub098\uc628 \uac8c\uc784, \uc2ec\uc9c0\uc5b4 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc911\uc784\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0 \uafb8\uc900\ud55c \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub97c \ud574\uc90c.\n + \ub9f5 \uacf3\uacf3\uc5d0 \uc788\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc720\uc801\uc9c0(?)\ub4e4\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud574 \uac8c\uc784 \ud50c\ub808\uc774\ub97c \uc880 \ub354 \uc27d\uac8c \ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c.\n ++ \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c\ud654\ub41c \uba40\ud2f0 \ud50c\ub808\uc774 \ubc0f \ud611\ub3d9\uc5d0\uc11c\ub9cc \ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec\uac00\uc9c0 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4.\n\n + or - \uc5ec\ub7ec\uac00\uc9c0\uc758 \uc704\ud5d8\ud55c \ud568\uc815\ub4e4 \ubc0f \ubcf4\uc2a4\ub4e4. \n         \ub09c\uc774\ub3c4\ub97c \ub192\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70 \uc2e0\uc911\ud55c \ud50c\ub808\uc774\ub97c \uc694\uad6c\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \ucee8\ud150\uce20.\n + or - \ub09c\uc774\ub3c4\uac00 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0.(\uc0ac\ub78c\ub9c8\ub2e4 \ub2e4\ub97c \uc218 \uc788\uc74c)\n\n - \ub9f5\uc774 \ub2e4\uc591\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc 1~2\uc2dc\uac04\ub9cc \ud574\ub3c4 \ub611\uac19\uc740 \ub9f5\uc744 \ub9cc\ub0a0\uc218 \uc788\uc74c.(\ub9f5 \uad6c\uc870\uac00 \uc77c\uc815\ud568)\n - \uc544\uc9c1 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc774 \uc644\ub8cc\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \uac8c\uc784\uc774\ub77c \ubd88\uc548\ud568.\n - - - \uba40\ud2f0\uc2dc \uc2ec\uac01\ud558\uac8c \uc0ac\ub78c\uc774 \uc5c6\uc74c. \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c\ud654\ub41c \uba40\ud2f0\uc784\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \uba40\ud2f0\uc720\uc800\uac00 \uc5c6\uc74c.\n\n\uacb0\ub860 = \ub9ce\uc740 \uc0ac\ub78c\ub4e4\uc774 \ud560\uc218\ub85d \uba40\ud2f0\ub294 \ud65c\uc131\ud654\ub418\uba70, \ubbf8\uc644\uc131\uc784\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \ub192\uc740 \ud004\ub9ac\ud2f0\uc640 \uc644\uc131\ub3c4\ub97c \ubcf4\uc774\ubbc0\ub85c \uc9c0\uae08 \ubc14\ub85c \uad6c\uc785\ud574\ub3c4 \ub420\ub9cc\ud55c \uc218\uc791. \ub2e4\ub9cc \ucd08\ubc18\uc5d0 \ud0c0\uac8c\uc784\uc5d0\uc11c \ub290\uaef4\ubcf4\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud55c \uacfc\ub3c4\ud55c \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc73c\ub85c \ud658\ubd88\uc694\uccad \uc0dd\uac01\uc774 \ub4e4 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\ub2c8 \uc8fc\uc758 \ubc14\ub78c.", "timestamp_created": 1488165397, "timestamp_updated": 1488641719, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30183885": {"recommendationid": "30183885", "author": {"steamid": "76561198148500528", "num_games_owned": 215, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 4377, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502054560}, "language": "english", "review": "Great Game.

Secondly There are many frustrating things that i hope change.\n\nTL/DR version, needs real progession instead of being based off skill and luck. Please make the wizard better to start off so that he can make it to beast mode, some spells need more damage or make it so that they level up through use/ level up when you do.  not so many insta-death mechanics\n\nThe game is pure rogue like, feels 100% random, gone entire games as a knight without finding a damn sword. \n\nThings i have the major issues with are the insta deaths in the game. they are around every corner and force you to plan every action around every mob. which can get tedious, i like insta deaths just wish there wasn't 50 thousand things that caused them. One thing that could save grace from this in my next point.\n\nZero progression, The only \"progression\" you get is that you unlock backgrounds that may or may not be beneficial. they are very minor stat bumps, and you can only pick one. Beyond the first or second level of the dungeon you may even forget what background you started with.  I wish there was something, ANY thing that made the next run just a little bit easier, so that you could eventually consistantly dive to the deepest parts. even if that took 100 runs to get there it would be nice.  After getting through the later areas of the game and getting to the \"you currently beat all available content\" screen twice in one playthrough (i was very sad and irritated how i died that run)  I would like to be able to consitanly get that far again, but the insta deaths are too stronk and with no progression its sometimes based purely on luck and layout that you get that far.\n\nClasses, the strongest two classes i've noticed are the knight and the rogue, the mage is next to useless considering how weak his starting spells/kit are and its purely random you'll get any spell book worth using. Now the magic that you can find in the game some of them are badass and would make the mage awesome, problem is getting them or getting lucky enough to get them. the other class just seems kinda meh... its a spoiler so i won't get into it here.\n\nAfter almost 50 hours of play my runs can run anywhere from an hour and half to 1 minute, theres nothing that makes the game easier the longer you play except learning the enemies, and mastery of the bullshit. Its a hard game and i enjoyed the challenge but without any progression i'm ready to move on. \n\nThings i think could make it better.\n\nReal progression. If i could choose to keep a piece of gear each run to use on my next run, that would be cool,\n if i could level up or upgrade my backgrounds, that would cool also. \nIf i could save my character inbetween each level and slowly delve deeper and deeper with the level being random every time i had to go back to my save in solo play that would be amazing.\n\nAttachment, you can't get attached to anything, like that sword? don't die then... like how this character is turning out? dont die... the perma death and loss of everything means that you start over fresh with that same shitty sword every run.

We kept dying and starting over until after about an hour and a half we quit. I wondered why the game got old so fast so I started running some solo games. \n\n10 deaths later I realized the full extent of the issue. Insta-deaths are difficult to balance properly due to the frustrating nature of them. Add perma-death and it becomes extremely difficult to properly manage, bordering on impossible. The way the Vagante developers have dealt with this is by putting instant death traps all over the place. This increases the difficulty by forcing you to pay constant attention, but also means that with one mistake or one unlucky knockback from an enemy you're dead. This is called artificial difficulty and it's a major flaw in any game, but Vagante suffers heavily from it by slapping you in the face with it over and over. \n\nOften games would start wonderfully and feel great due to the art and beating enemies and bosses, then the game would give you interesting loot and reward you for overcoming challenge after challenge, the you miss one pressure plate while fighting off multiple enemies and you die. There is no challenge failed, there is no rewarding glory of death in battle, there is only frustration that you made one mistake or took one bad risk and you ended your game that you otherwise loved.\n\nUltimately the mechanic is there to frustrate and increase difficulty and time of play, but it falls completely flat as insta-death mechanics so often do. It's unfortunate because the game is otherwise so interesting and fun to play. Until this changes the game is extremely noob unfriendly and frustrating.\n\n9/10 with a reworked trap system, but as it is now I would suggest to all my friends to stay away until this changes.", "timestamp_created": 1483864905, "timestamp_updated": 1483865202, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 51, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.537625", "comment_count": "22", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29090693": {"recommendationid": "29090693", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995169557", "num_games_owned": 360, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 6139, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498682352}, "language": "english", "review": "this game is another example of great player authorship and satisfying gameplay with a nuanced combat and skill system, 4 player local co op that doesn't get cluttered, gamma correction for projectors, easily change your keybindings, not too hard to explain to your friends that are garbage at video games.

For games with no real end (Minecraft, Project Zomboid, Overwatch) this may be up until the point that I run out of things to do or have experienced everything it has to offer, everything being relative to what the makers put in, not mods. With 28 hours logged into this game from periodic play over roughly three years (I know, a tiny ammount in reality but the game has only just become fairly stable in terms of updates and much of my other time, much to my regret, is with a pirated version from a friend) I have finally \"Beaten\" Vagante. For those whom would like a short version in order to inform their decision to buy it or are just curious here it is: Don't waste your time on Vagante (at least for now).\n\nNow Before Fan Boys (or Girls) get up my ass about how I'm wrong here's a slightly longer version: Vagante is a great game that I love but I could never and would never recommend to anyone to play, not even the coarse, experienced, and highly skilled Rogue-Like player. Here's why I feel that way.\n\nMe and my good friend love, I mean really LOVE Rogue-Likes. So much so that we created a kind of \"Expectations\" or \"Guide\" to what makes a game a great Rogue-Like.\n\n[olist]\n    [*] The game should start you off weak and easily killable, but with the tools you need either to fight back or avoid conflict.\n    [*] The game should offer players some way to get stronger without minimizing the level of danger\n    [*] The game should constantly offer increasingly dangerous odds without ever elevating to the point of immposibility or pixel perfection mind sets\n    [*] Players should, to some level, want to seek out danger. If players never want to leave their realitive saftey then it is showing of a lack of enough of a reward incentive when approching risk.\n    [*] Players must be forced into learning how to both think thoroughly and on their toes, that way every encounter is a test of skill and reason, and thus their ability to face these test should never be based on luck such as whether or not they pick up a certain item early or late.\n    [*] And most  importantly every death, and I mean every death, should be the players fault, whether that means they did not understand the danger they were in, were too reckless, or they did not have the skill to go through the encounter they approched willingly. This should be done without limiting styles of play or creating a \"meta\" where only some characters are viable.\n[/olist]\n\nNow, while this is only our opinions when it comes to these games we think each of these offer a valid point in mind, and thus have only given one game full checks on this ever: Risk of Rain, a game which we have a combined total from online play to local of over 200 hours, a disgustingly large number compared to every other Rogue-Like we've played. So, why do I bring all of this up? Well, because Vagante easily fails four of these, specifically, the four ladder most checks. To clarify lets start with three. The game [b] starts\t[/b] with Pixel Perfect Mind Sets i.e. the jumping puzzle before you ever enter the dungeon which nets you the nimble quirk. It's one of many instaces of honestly ridiculous odds. For four from experience with personal play time and online playing no one ever wants to seek out anything truely dangerous for the sole fact that even a little loss of life can spell doom when going into the next level and those that due are often the bane of the part and the precieved reason for failure i.e. the wildling is reckless and draws too many enemies out, then dies causing us to have to rez them or causing us to die and they being unwilling to rez. Bosses (especially in the later half of the game) are typically too much of a bother and the game shifts from a dungeon crawl to a full on hell sprint where the focus moves from slowely taking ones time to trying to rush through without getting hit or fighting to the exit. For five there have been countless games where the only reason I got as far as I did was because I picked up a really strong item early game. Even for my winning game my party and I only made it through because we were blessed with Vit items early on and traded them back and forth while running through. Sure, it forced us to work together and I enjoyed being the hero of the day dishing out stolen vit item we found but the fact that we would have died without it was generally sucky. And finaly number six, easily the most important rule of thumb and too the biggest failure. While many deaths in Vagante are player driven, an equal amount are total and utter Bullshite. To elaborate there are often many games that have ended not due to a player mistake or recklessness but instead and unfair  gimmick (as I refuse to call such things mechanics). Case and point my winning game. My party and I all sit at the bonfire wary but sure of ourselves. I've been pumping shadow to full, and giving myself one point in daggers and archery for better overall dmg. Since looping I've also pushed my Vit up four times and my elusive play style has rewarded me with 120 health points and a full bar along with snazzy armour and some really good weapons, plus some health items to boot. I feel like the hero of the game, my party only barely surviving our inital run thanks to some unfun but well meaning tactics of \"Dont't fight, just run, and if you die twice use your skull to find the exit and then lead everyone there\". The enemies are stronger but so are we and our team work is nearly flawless. We make our way into the Spirit Forest once more killing the shopkeeper with ease and exploring while loot gathering. The boss is the Plant Monster, my party dives into the fray, with me bringing up the rear. We avoid the plant head though every now and then we're hit but the damage is low thanks to defense and poison resist. everything is going well until BAM, I'm caught and the plant head dives underground with me in it and I get insta-killed. The same happens to our mage and me again when I reform as a skeleton. 118 health (I took a little dmg) to zero, just like that. How is that fair? Where is the test of skill or trial of battle? There was none. I and my teammate were simply killed to an unfair gimmick. The party survived the encounter but my paitence did not and I gave up all of my items, told my new mates fairwell, and now we're here.\n\nNow, I realize that Vagante is still early acess but as is I just can't recomend this game to anyone. I love the art style of the game, looking like a 2d version of my dream game. The score is beautiful composed really setting the mood for the game. The RPG elements are spot on being easily understandable but still complex enough to show off your custom version of classes. Combat, while simple, is for the most part engaging. Crafting is simple and fun to do as minecraft, even though there is little of it. However, with all that said I just can't forgive these other issues. When an entire group of veteran players tell you to run past hard to reach content instead of enjoy it as you would other areas it's extreamly telling of what kind of problems the game has. Again, as is, I can't say I would recomend Vagante nor would I really even play it anymore if I had more options (You win this time developers. I've had and played this game far too long to refund it.) but alas I'm a poor college kid and don't, yet even still I can't say I'll be playing much for a while. Developers, if your reading this please, don't take any of what I'm saying spietfully. I love this game and would like, no, I need you to take this as constructive feedback. I wan't to explore the catacombs and rift as thoroughly as I do the Dark Caves, not run through them barely able to distguish things as I make a mad dash for the exit.

One of the only games I can safely say, that I will keep playing even after beating it. It has great replayability value, and is fun with friends as well!\n\n[b] Some things I've learned the hard way (tips): [/b]\n\nAlways keep track of your resistances depending on the floor and bosses you need to fight. If you have +3 resistance in any type (lightning, poison, fire, etc), you are practically invulnerable to that damage. [spoiler] The forest floor is especially good with +3 or more poioson resistance. [/spoiler]\n\nIt might be better for you to try single player before you go into multiplayer, as the stats you are given at the beginning aren't split up over multiple people (you'll start with more health or strength or whatever is relevant to your class if you're alone).\n\nDon't rush floors (this one should go without saying), unless you're some diehard speedrunner.\n\nShops are worth stealing from. An easy way to kill shop keepers is to lure them onto spikes. It gets easier to kill them in floor 2 and beyond as they don't scale with your stats.\n\nIt's always worth killing the bosses on each floor, however the difficulty gap in bosses really increases the deeper you go. Zone 2's bosses are easier than zone 3's, zone 4's are pretty similar to zone 3's, etc etc.\n\n[b]The game has a great dev team that releases updates pretty consistantly. The community for this game, since it is somewhat niche, is also really nice. I highly recommend getting it for yourself - and if you do get it, good luck!

As with many rogue-like games, the difficulty curve at the beginning can be a bit excruciating. You'll be dying a LOT in the first few levels at the beginning. (And in a rogue-like, a death means game over, go back and start from the beginning). With that said, after playing with friends for a bit under 5 hours, I feel that you really start to get a hang for the game.\n\nAt the beginning, the worlds seem endless and mystical, with sooo many items to collect. The basic premise is that levels are grouped in 3 or 4, where those 3 or 4 consecutive levels will be one \"area\" with a certain theme/enemies, etc. And as you progress you find more areas.\n\nWell, after a decent amount of areas, the whole thing loops again, and you basically replay through every area again, but with much harder enemies the second time around. This is fun and can still provide some challenge, however, once you go through these areas a second time, you just get put into an infinite loop of only staying in one \"area\" at the end.\n\nAt this point, I have played a bit over 10 hours, and I feel that with 2 friends, we can get to the final \"area\" about half of the time, and once you get there, you just keep looping through the same levels with more and more enemies until it's downright impossible.\n\nThere is definitely some balancing that needs to occur, as now that I've played with some friends for a bit over 10 hours, we just continue playing the game until so many enemies start spawning that the server lags and the game becomes quite literally unplayable. However, at the same time, note that we've gotten all of the best gear at this point, and there really isn't much left to do. The only way to beat the levels at that point was basically to use some cheap abilities to just run to the exit unharmed and/or undetected and leave, and repeat. We did this for about 25 levels in the last \"area\" before we basically quit because the game was so laggy it was unplayable.\n\n\nWith all this said, it is an extremely fun game to learn, and it's still a work in progress so more will be added over time. As of right now, playing with a few friends, I don't know if you'd ever get much more than 30 or 40 hours out of the game at absolute max, but still WELL worth the purchase, and an absolute blast to play with friends.", "timestamp_created": 1479806832, "timestamp_updated": 1479806832, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "26742027": {"recommendationid": "26742027", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995197417", "num_games_owned": 632, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 5716, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491455234}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutely love this game.

From a stealthy rogue surgically killing enemies with throwing daggers, to a God-cursed sword wielding Knight cutting swathes through monsters, and the ingenious mage using every spell at your disposal to outmaneuver and obliterate your foes. But not every run turns out with a champion. Spikes, Boulders, Angry Shopkeepers and increasingly fierce monsters will ensure that many adventurers meet their dooms. Although it never felt impossible. Each death felt like it was my own mistake due to lack of skill, and I never felt like there was something unbalanced or unfair.\n\nVagante features alternate progression routes, a huge variety of item types with randomized stats, procedurally generated levels, multiple classes, and a reasonable learning curve, making it rewarding to progress.\n\nThis game is well-worth the price, especially for early access, though at the time of writing this I believe it's very near release state. And as of writing this I haven't even completed everything or played much multiplayer. \n\nTL;DR if you have played platformer and dungeon crawler rogue-like games such as Spelunky, Risk of Rain, or Rogue Legacy you'll feel right at home here.

We went straight into multiplayer, which skips the tutorial aspect of the game... and even with the tutorial, there is a LOT that isn't explained to you when you start out, that you learn through trial... and a lot of error.\n\nThis game is hard. If you're looking at this review wondering whether or not you want to buy it, the answer is... do you feel ready to face a Dark Souls level of learning curve? This game isn't forgiving, and very hard to fully comprehend when you start BECAUSE of how much detail the developers put into it. There are strategies, tricks and secret aspects to this game that run so deep that it actually makes getting started quite confusing.\n\nIf you want to make this easier, you need to look at the wiki. This isn't all too comprehensive, but try some strategy guides for your class, read up on what your abilities actually do/how to use them... and from there, you can start to make stuff up a little more on your own, but this'll stop you from investing in something that has an application you can't properly utilize.\n\nIs the game itself good? It's rich, deep, and full of promise from some devoted developers who are planning to add more. I would heartily recommend it.\n\nIs it worth $15 in its current state? Yes. 20 hours in and even in co-op we're struggling to beat the last level, and that's on my first class choice- I have three others to test out for entirely different gameplay experiences!\n\nHow's the co-op? Thus far, for all the devs warn about it being 'unstable', we've encountered one bug in 20 hours of gameplay and over 50 individual games. The devs know their stuff, and 'unstable' by their standards is far from that of most other indie greenlight stuff. \n\nIs this my kind of game, and will I enjoy the experience? Well, I like to compare it to experiences like FTL over Don't Starve. If you die, you're not going to cry for hours. It's pretty easy to get back to where you are, and much less brutal for ten hours of progress lost or something. For the gameplay itself as opposed to the roguelike side of it, it's very much like the Spelunky era of games, very similar to going caving in Terraria but much more structured and complex. \n\nIn its current state, I'd give the game an 8/10. To address the downsides that aren't solely the difficulty curve... It does at this stage lack a little bit of content, the soundtrack leaves something to be desired, and I have no idea how to unlock that %#*$ing chained chest- plus a little more starting character customization would go a longer way. The unlock system is nice as it stands, but I feel like it needs work/more complexity to add a bit more starting flavour than one trait and YOLO it up on the RNG. The new resurrection system (you need a certain amount of health to resurrect your teammates by walking over their graves) is great, though a bit more mechanic specification for co-op would be helpful (took us ages to figure this out.)", "timestamp_created": 1476948461, "timestamp_updated": 1476948461, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "26116325": {"recommendationid": "26116325", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996587733", "num_games_owned": 78, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2274, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503974742}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing gameplay, great with friends.\nIf you don't understand that the traps are supposed to be well... hard to see, this definitely isn't the game for you.

If you're willing to be patient and correct your mistakes it will reward you. In my first 50 or so runs I very rarely made it past the Dark Caves, but somewhere along the way I started to get a good feel for the game and now if I don't at least make it to the Catacombs I consider it to be a particularly bad run.

But I ran into a nasty bug where you could unbind keys but not set them again. I went back to try and play with the default controls but my hands are just to big i would much rather play with the Tab, Q, W, E, R line than Shift, Z, X, C, V.

There should be some sort of final thing rather than game just ending, this current design just tends to go against the usual gaming design.\n5) Chance based talents are pretty awful\n6) I would love there to be better reward on gaining boss than gaining the remaining experience bar, instead you should get full experience bar per boss, allowing you to get more than just 2 levels per 2 levels if you kill all minions.

E se isso acontecer, vai se tornar mainstreram e talvez maior que Spelunky, Darkest Dungeon, Risk of Rain, Rogue Legacy, Enter the Gungeon e qualquer outro roguelike de qualidade. \n", "timestamp_created": 1471911886, "timestamp_updated": 1471911886, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25075087": {"recommendationid": "25075087", "author": {"steamid": "76561197982559535", "num_games_owned": 148, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1191, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511741567}, "language": "french", "review": "Le meilleur du genre a mon go\u00fbt, bourr\u00e9 de surprises et un gameplay aux petits oignons ! c'est rare !", "timestamp_created": 1471879846, "timestamp_updated": 1471879846, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25047771": {"recommendationid": "25047771", "author": {"steamid": "76561198176974838", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 252, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502711600}, "language": "english", "review": "Harder than risk of rain", "timestamp_created": 1471762638, "timestamp_updated": 1471762638, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509535", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25039497": {"recommendationid": "25039497", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020833136", "num_games_owned": 84, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 38386, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 23, "last_played": 1514082464}, "language": "english", "review": "After countless deaths I finally reached the catacombs.

Every floor is randomly generated, every weapon is different from every other weapon either in big or small ways. Even the consumables randomize every character, so the red scroll for your rogue game could be different for the one in your knight game. Some people do [b]not[/b] like it when their basic items switch around, but for me it's somewhat refreshing (reminding me of Pixel Dungeon on mobile, actually).\nSecondly, it's got progression. You don't have to play the same character every time you play, and I'm not just talking about the classes. Each class has a few different skills that you can level, and they can change the way you play drastically. Can't hit that thing flying above you? Put a couple points in the Sword skill and you'll be able to overhand-chop at it. Really need to boost one of your stats? Sink a point into it and enjoy the strength. And because of these skills, each class can play very differently.\nThirdly, [i]items![/i] This game knows how to scratch the looting itch. Every single item you get has different enchantments [spoiler]and sometimes curses[/spoiler] that affect the game in different ways. Anywhere from wall-grabbing to stronger arrow shots to even phasing through walls can be on your single piece of armor. There's a variety of different weapons that each have their own kind of \"weight\" to them, so to say. A sword does not swing like a club does not stab like a dagger does not chop like an axe, if you can process my line of thought. Add in the many kinds of wands and magic spells, and you will not hurt for loot-gathering (that is, until you hit the inventory cap).\nThis game also has some great music for traversing each area, but I won't go into too much detail on that.\nAnd, as much as I like this game, I have to admit a few faults I've found. The controls are somewhat overcomplicated, but there's a tutorial to get you used to them, and in a few playthroughs you'll learn them pretty well. I've also found that, in each area, there's not the biggest variety of monsters. In the first area, you've got slimes, bats, and goblins. Those are what you're gonna see for the most part, besides the bosses that are placed in each room.\n[strike](I'd also argue about a few bullshit deaths that I've had, but I totally concede that I'm not good at vidja games and that it's a roguelike game which entails some amount of bullshittery.)[/strike]\nBut, all in all this has been one of my favorite games since I grabbed it.

To top it all off, the unlockables, you unlock skills and talents as you go making it more or less challenging!\n\nThere are 4 classes, Knight, Rogue, Mage, Wildling, all with unique abilities that offer a different experience to each game. The graphics are absolutely wonderful! They are simple, but updated pixel graphics, beautiful to watch and play! While there isn't much in the way of story, or explanation, it's to be expected by most rogue-likes anyway, so in that department, it's par for the course.\n\nLastly, there is multiplayer. While this feature is still in beta, it works relatively well (unless someone dies, then reviving is a little confusing, and doesn't always work). The multiplayer is fun, and entertaining.

It's fun, it's beautiful and the sound design is absolutely phenomenal.  However, I'm holding off on it until it gets further into development before I play it for real.\n\nThe controls are very overengineered.  You will spend a lot of time setting and resetting the controls when starting out before you finally realize this game has about 2 or 3 more buttons than it even needs.  For example, there's an Interact button, but when you're in menus, the Melee Attack button is used as Confirm.  It takes a couple runthroughs of setting the buttons before you start noticing little weird things like this that make it really hard to find a comfortable control scheme.  There's so many buttons that you're going to have to compromise and put certain things on shoulder buttons that you really don't want up there. \n\nGame designers usually strive for less buttons because making a huge list of buttons with exactly one function makes the player have to constantly stop and try to remember what does what.  The popular solution most games have used is give buttons multiple functions based on context.\n\nSo often you come across an object in this game and you have to go \"wait, do I push up or down? Do I push interact? Or do I bonk it with my sword?\"  And you have to make these decisions in dangerous environments with traps and enemies.  Even navigating menus is way more complicated than it should be.\n\nThis game is playable if you really put in the work to find a good control scheme, and then do some rote memorization.  But, this is just a 2d RPG platformer, there's no reason why the controls need to be so complex.  \n\nI think if the devs sit down and honestly try to simplify the controls and make it more intuitive for a wide audience of players, they'd have a real classic on their hands.

It's not quite as challenging or clever as Rogue Legacy, but Vagante supports multiple players, so it has that as a major advantage.  It's fast-paced, scary at times, and has a lot of explorable environments (it's a roguelike, duh, it has infinite environments).  It provides you with 4 seemingly unisex character classes, a level-up system, equipment, standard potions and other healing items, and magic spells learned mostly from spellbooks.  Combat is difficult but simple enough for new players to jump right in.  Players cannot hot-join or join in the middle of dungeon levels, but there are break zones or lobby areas to chill, let players join, and prepare for the next level.\n\nOverall, Vagante is well worth its initial price of $14.99, even if you only play alone, because it provides a fairly well polished experience that's simply not common in the roguelike genre.  It's great for multiple players, as well, and I bought the game for that purpose.

I found myself playing over and over for hours. Each time I died, I wanted to play again to see if I could get further. The randomly generated levels can get a bit repetitive, but you feel that much more accomplished as you make it deeper into the cave and new content is revealed.\n\nThe combat is also simple but fun. I only tried the Knight, but I found it entertaining to time my attacks and kill the little creatures that came after me. The one downfall is that the AI is relatively dumb. You can easily trick the smaller mobs to jump onto a trap, and even the boss/elite mob per level lacks a challange once you learn their several repeatative moves.\n\nLeveling and character building is limited. You have several categories you can invest your points into, but you don't get many skill points to spend, so there's not much room for building your character. Of course-that's likely the point. The further into the Cave you get, the more powerful you'll become. The game simply requires patience to get there.\n\nHowever, the best part of the game is definitely the randomly generated equipment you find scattered about. You have to identify everything. You can simply equip it right off in hopes you don't receive a cursed item, or find identifying scrolls for a much safer route. The only downfall to equipment (and this isn't important to many, but it is to me) is that your character's look doesn't change when you put on new armor. Again-probably not a big deal to some, but I tend to enjoy games more when my character's look changes like a virtual Barbi/Ken doll :-)\n\nOverall-the game is fun and quite addictive.

Enemies are resilient enough to where you need to understand how they attack to properly dodge and retaliate, but a few enemies don't give much chance for a reaction unless you have plain view and know it's coming, or get lucky with a fall or strange dodge or item effect.\n\nBoth good and bad, though you might want to give the plant monster dude its own interactions, like while a head is munching you, making the others keep their distance.

For what it is so far, it's pretty damn good and shows plenty of potential at the stage it's at right now. I've already gotten over 20 hours into it. So I'll go ahead and just list the pros and cons and discuss certain points in further detail...\n\n\nPros:\n------\n+ Concise/Tight controls\n+ Streamlined GUI\n+ Good Art Design\n+ Ambient Music and Good Atmosphere\n+ Great variety of Items & Status Effects\n+ Difficult and Rewarding Gameplay\n+ Great Developer Involvment & Tech Support\n\nCons\n------\n- Lots of Multiplayer Bugs\n- Level Generation can be Repetitive\n- Occasionally frustrating and unfair deaths\n- Leveling System is too stringent and one sided\n- Lack of Story\n=========================================\n\n+ Good Art Design/ Great Atmosphere\n\nOne of the biggest reasons why I got this game was the atmosphere and art design. It's very well made and draws you into the game which is accompanied by a great ambient soundtrack. The sound design itself is very tactile and satisfying as well. Feels good everytime you pick up coins, items, and unlock treasure chests which can help keep the player motivated and engrossed. \n\n+ Difficult and Rewarding Gameplay\n\nThis game is ridiculously difficult, I've yet to even get to the final area (There's only 4 main areas of the game) let alone complete it. However, it's very rewarding. You have to be very precatious and slow when trecking through the dungeons, learning to manage your resources along the way. For the most part, deaths are pretty fair and can be blamed on just being careless. Even when I get far into the game and end up dying, it's very satisfying just to see what items and weapons I managed to get along the way, and generally doesn't bother me when I have to go all the way back.\n\n+ Great Developer Involvment & Tech Support\n\nWhat I found the most suprising was how helpful and receptive the developers are for this game, especially it being an early access game where most people tend to just abandon their projects. They seems to really care about their game and are regularly updating and patching the game to make it better. I experienced a graphical error early on in one of the updates. However, they were very quick to respond and fixed the problem the same night. More early access games need this kind of dedication to take off.\n\n- Online Multiplayer\n\nAlthough I'm sure they're very busy working on making the multiplayer work, it still is a very glaring issue with the game. There are quite a lot of bugs that are very distracting and in some cases make it unplayable. Which is a shame because if it did work properly, this game would be abosuletly amazing to play with a group of friends. At least for the moment, the multiplayer is pretty much unplayable.\n\n- Level Generation can be Repetitive\n\nFor a roguelite, the level generation is a bit scarce and repetitive. When you start playing it for a while, and go back to the first area (Trust me... you're going to be there a lot, get comfy) you start to notice the algorythyms of the levels and can generally know what's around the corner without too much trouble. This can make things a little less painless going through the first level, but at the same time can get a little bit boring and predictable.\n\n- Leveling System is too Stringent and One-Sided\n\nProbably one of the most annoying for me personally is the way the leveling system works. Basically you can level up one of two ways. You can either kill the boss thats on every floor in the game which automatically levels you up, or you can get XP by killing a bunch of normal enemies. However, the problem with this is that you can only level up ONCE per floor which is quite frustrating in my opinion and can limit your experimentation with different stats and perks. The stats you can lvl up are either class related, or straight up stats like str, mag, luck, etc. However there isn't much use in lvl'ing up anything besides a couple class related stats. I would personally get rid of lvl'ing up raw stats since you tend to get a lot of gear and weapons that boost your stats anyways.\n\n\nOVERALL:  8.0/10.0\n-----------\n\nAll in all, I think it's a pretty fun game that has a lot of potential in the future. The developers regularly work on it and update it. I would definately recommend getting this game. However if you're apprehensive about getting it, nothing wrong with waiting until this goes on sale. So if you like roguelites, or just hard games in general, definately look out for it!\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1466108684, "timestamp_updated": 1466108684, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23563706": {"recommendationid": "23563706", "author": {"steamid": "76561198175686175", "num_games_owned": 67, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 5676, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512374515}, "language": "english", "review": "Stage 1 Caves: This is your tutorial of the game, it's mechanics, and with some fairly easy bosses to make you feel good about yourself. If you value your life and valuables I suggest not going into the ruins, you're going to have a bad time.\n\nStage 2 Forest: Ok, you're doing good you got past the easy part. The forest isn't bad except for the bowman shooting you, the golems with large hp and heavy hits, the birds that throw knifes, and the maneating plants (those f**king maneating plants). The bosses seem overwelming at first but after some deaths you learn their patterns and the best approach assuming you have reasonable equipment.\n\nStage 3 Catacombs: Awesome you made it to the catcombs, if you thought the caves very claustrophobic then you'll love this place. First off, prepare to die many times. The catcombs are not your friend nor will it ever be. It's not a fun place, if you don't have the right items to make things easier or have the ability to dodge everything and run. Chances are that place will be your catacombs. If you get molested by giant hands don't say we didn't warn you. Now then, the bosses. IF you are not totally insane or you're confident in your skill and equipment you can try the bosses. One of them you can most likely beat. Another will take some time and good dodge skills. The last one you will most likely die, he hits hard and is scary head to toe, not to mention moves fast. But don't bite off more then you can chew because once you reach the catacombs you really get the sense that you'll do anything to survive because you don't want to do everything over again.\n\nStage 4 The Rift: For completing your periless journey through the catacombs you are rewarded to a beautiful scenery and music. That's pretty much all the reward you'll receive. The enemies are designed to kill you shortly but the biggest obstacle is the fact you're on mini f**king islands that have teleportation doors that need time to charge the first time you use them. But those things are the little concerns you have to deal with. just pray you don't land on an island with the boss. If you are one of those people who needs to fight every boss God Speed you suicidal maniac. 9/10 times you will die in this place, at least you die in the floating sky. But, this is either the hardest stage or the easiest, if you have one item you can complete The Rift will hardly any trouble.

This game is pretty fun, but it has some serious problems.

Traps that instantly kill you, the shop selling useless overpriced shit, the basic enemies have way too much health and do a lot of damage, healing effects are extremely rare, the game is very harsh with falling damage, enchantment scrolls can add NEGATIVE enchantments to items, etc etc etc. If you are one of those guys that really enjoyed getting fucked in the Souls games and stuff like that, you'll probably like this game.\n-Some bosses are straight up stupid. The goblin king has no business being a Zone 1 boss with his unpredictable movement and very high damage. The plant boss in the forest might very well be the most frustrating boss I have faced in any game EVER. He sits there like a smug asshole while his little drone-line plant buddies attack you from below. If you're a melee class good luck fighting him, there is literally no counterplay. Oh, also he poisons you and kills you in about 4 seconds flat if he grabs you. The basic enemies in the third zone can easily kill you by themselves if you aren't paying attention because they do absolutely ridiculous amount of damage. \n\nMan... when I put it like that, I wonder why I recommended this game.

Gameplay mechanics are very simple, especially in the beginning, yet as you level up and get new abilities, it actually becomes rather deep and complex for being a 2d platformer. It's hard, so don't get this if you're not looking for a challenge. You will die. Many times.  It's less forgiving than Dark Souls. Some of the enemies and obstacles may seem a bit unfair at first but after a while you start to be more aware of what you should be looking for; whether it be pressure-plate trap triggers or analyzing enemies' patterns to dodge and counter. You'll find your average play progression steadily rising once it starts to click.\n\n\nThe real gem is online play with a full party of 4.  Once you've crawled through 6 dungeons together with your team and rest around the campfire together, you start to feel this real sense of bond with these people you're struggling to survive with.  Everyone I've played with has been a chill and/or friendly team player.\n\n\nI've only owned this game for 3 weeks and already they have patched one of my two issues with the game- their crashes on the online mode have seemingly stopped since they last patched, which even still to the time of me writing this you have to click a button saying you understand that the online mode is still very much in beta; to basically expect error , which now the only error i'm really seeing is that it's telling us we have more skill points to spend than we really do a lot of the time\n\n The only other issue I have is that the map is too small... you are literally 1 pixel on your high definition laptop screen on the little map you see in the corner, and I can't make out the map at all if I'm playing it on 1080i 40\" tv.\n\nGet this game.

Everything is random, from boss locations to weapon drops.\n2. There is a skill system that allows you to become stronger as you progress.\n3. The gameplay itself is very smooth and built for replay value. From stabbing to jumping there is a lot of satisfaction in timing your hits just right, or running through everything recklessly.\n4. All of the bosses are fairly challenging. There's no way you'll breeze past any of them on your first try.\n5. There is an in-game chat box for communication, and most of the time people are generally nice and share potions/items with you.\n\nCONS:\n\n( These are based on Multiplayer Only, and I expect these issues to be addressed in due time as the Developing team is always working on updating this game and fixing bugs. )\n\n1. This game crashes in multiplayer sometimes. ( You can usually just rejoin the game if crashed though. )\n2. Because this game is in early access, there are some bugs now and again.\n3. Some class abilities are more useful than others for overall survival.\n4. The button config is weird at first. ( Best played with a controller imo. )\n5.

There have been, for over a year now, consistent updates every 3 or so weeks, without fail. Developers like Nuke Nine are what gives me hope for the constantly abused Early Access system. Now that my gushery is over, let's look at the actual game.\n\n         For the presentation, we get a lovely score and sound design by Sam English that really eminates a feeling of solitude, but still encourages you to press on until you find that one magical sword or that one rare wizard hat. The sprites are to die for, the character sprites in particular. (These have since changed since the trailer released, so if you didn't like those, they aren't what I'm talking about.) Additionally, each of the four playable classes has four different sprites to choose from, with a grand total of 16 (20, if you count skeletons) different character sprites! Every animation is smooth and crisp, so everything looks exactly like it's intended to.\n\n        Regarding the gameplay, the platforming is smooth, the combat is fun, and each class really feels different. Each trap or enemy placement makes total sense, so every piece of precious health lost really feels like it's the player's fault. The game is great fun on your own, sure, but playing with 3 friends is a complete blast, and truly feels like it works hand-in-hand with the singleplayer game. It doesn't feel tacked-on afterthought, but it doesn't feel like the entire focus of the game either, which is something a lot of these co-operative indie games in the market nowadays need more of, a proper singleplayer experience. I won't go into the intimate details of the gameplay mechanics too much, but I will grace over them. In terms of the game's meta, Vagante could described as a game of choices. Oh look, I found a spellbook! Do I offer it to a shrine, give it to the party Mage, or burn it at the campfire (between-levels resting place, where your inventory can be managed and you can get a bit of healing) and get extra health? Golly gee whiz, I killed a boss monster, now I have a key! Should I just open the big chest right away, save it for a later level, or use it on this mysterious door? I leveled up! Should I spend a point in a specific statistic, if so, strength or vitality? Should I use it on one of my classes 3 to 4 traits, such as the Wildling's Berserk or the Mage's Alchemy? The act of simply discussing the pros and cons of a decision with your party is a lot of fun, but don't think of Vagante as some intellectual debate room. If you have friends like mine, expect a lot of fun combat encounters, inside jokes to be shared, and arguments over who to revive from skeleton form. Lastly, heed this advice. Don't use a wiki. Heck, don't google anything. One of the coolest parts of Vagante is going out and finding out if x spell is a good counter against y boss, what happens if you kill the shopkeeper, etc.\n\n         TL;DR: This game is the best to happen to Early Access. It's consistently updated, the gameplay is tremendous fun, and the presentation is spot on.\n\n          Final Rating: 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1463501349, "timestamp_updated": 1463501349, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.544863", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23039361": {"recommendationid": "23039361", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077725913", "num_games_owned": 281, "num_reviews": 457, "playtime_forever": 63, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506688401}, "language": "english", "review": "game is great but need lot work i know its early acess game but i have played better ones then this one \ndie way to easy loco copo sucks and i rebot game like a dumb ass trying to give them a chanes but nope  still shitty game. plus watching paint dry is way more fun", "timestamp_created": 1463499921, "timestamp_updated": 1506688605, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.229670", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23035481": {"recommendationid": "23035481", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002389233", "num_games_owned": 49, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2430, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498746698}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u042d\u0442\u043e \u043b\u0443\u0448\u0438\u0439 \u043f\u043b\u0430\u0442\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0440\u043e\u0433\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043a, \u0432 \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0439 \u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043b \u0437\u0430 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u044e \u0436\u0438\u0437\u043d\u044c!\n10 \u0440\u043e\u0433\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u0438\u0437 10\n\u0418\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043b \u0437\u0430 4 \u043a\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0441\u0430: \u0440\u044b\u0446\u0430\u0440\u044c, \u0440\u043e\u0433\u0430, \u043c\u0430\u0433 \u0438 \u0431\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0435\u0440\u043a. \u0412\u043e\u0437\u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u0432 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0435 \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0435\u0449\u0451 \u043a\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0441\u044b, \u043d\u043e \u044f \u043e\u0442\u043a\u0440\u044b\u043b \u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u0431\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0435\u0440\u043a\u0430(\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0443\u043f\u043d\u044b \u043f\u043e \u0443\u043c\u043e\u043b\u0447\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044e).\n\u041a\u0430\u0436\u0434\u044b\u0439 \u043a\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0441 \u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0447\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c, \u0434\u043e\u0431\u0430\u0432\u043b\u044f\u044f \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u044b \u0438\u043b\u0438 \u0441\u043a\u0438\u043b\u044b. \u0423\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0434\u0430\u0451\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0437\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u0436\u0434\u0443\u044e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0439\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0443\u044e \u043b\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044e. \u041b\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u0433\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0440\u0443\u044e\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0441\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0430\u0439\u043d\u043e. \u041d\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u0436\u0434\u043e\u0439 \u043b\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u0432\u0430\u0441 \u0436\u0434\u0451\u0442 \u0431\u043e\u0441\u0441 \u0438 \u0435\u0433\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u043e\u0431\u044f\u0437\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u0443\u0431\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c, \u0447\u0442\u043e\u0431\u044b \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0439\u0442\u0438 \u043b\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044e. \n\u0422\u0430\u043a \u0436\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u043b\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f\u0445 \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0442\u043e\u0440\u0433\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0446 \u0441 3 \u0432\u0435\u0449\u0430\u043c\u0438. \u0415\u0433\u043e \u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0431\u0438\u0442\u044c.

some concerning things. So here I go, a bit prematurely, but if this game goes on sale I want to provide you a proper review.\n\nI want to give this game a mixed review. I don't find that it is worth $15 in its current state. It simply lacks content. But it is a very good game and has a potentially fantastic future if the devs keep on their current track.\n\nHowever: this game is NOT the ultimate rogue-like/lite. It still faces all of the problems of your average rogue-lite, including:\n\n1.) Sometimes just have a bad start from which you can't fully recover.\n2.) A great deal of stuff is just NOT EXPLAINED. That's actually one of my major gripes with the game; it doesn't explain anything. This is a dreadfully common problem with rogue-like games (a genre which I love). Vagante is a prime example of this tendency.\n3.) Procedural generation of levels sometimes makes the game very unfair.\n4.) Bugs. Few have been game-breaking, and the game is in early-access as of writing this review, hence why this item is #4 on my little list here.\n\nSo let's talk about what the game is like. Some here have compared it to a 2D Dark Souls. I can understand where the comparison comes from, but its not really accurate. Yes, the game is something of a dark fantasy (and I do admire the art style). Yes, the game is quite hard at first. That's where the comparison ends, though. Dark Souls is an entirely different game. This is a rogue-lite dungeon crawler, through and through.\n\nThe first thing I noticed is the control scheme. It's entirely keyboard driven with no mouse at all. It takes a little getting used to, but it becomes very intuitive fairly quickly. I believe the game also supports gamepad and controller (I could be wrong).\n\nNext, this game will kill you A LOT. There are a lot of insta-death scenarios and your character can't take very many hits. However, all deaths are within your control, which is something I've found very refreshing. This is one of the few games where when one of my characters dies, I laugh it off more than get upset about it. The devs really reached a sweet spot in animation, audio, and visuals that make instadeath a unique blend of comical and ... something I can't quite describe. The point is, I'm the guy who would cuss at the screen after getting killed in Enter the Gungeon, and in this I find myself far more often giggling about it.\n\nBefore I get into my main problems with the game aside from what I listed above, I'll talk about what I liked:\n\n++ The procedural generation is quite good. I've been surprised by how certain segments can link together in interesting ways. The mechanic of being able to push blocks has been key to this.\n\n++ The platforming is very fluid and responsive.\n\n++ Art is beautiful.\n\n++ The music is very good. This game provides a surprisingly ambient, calming experience, provided by the blending of the dark visuals and the music.\n\n++ The game's core mechanics (e.g., stats, resistances, items, abilities) are easy to understand.\n\n++ Sound effects are satisfying and have a nice retro feel.\n\n++ I enjoyed the way the game decided to set up its control scheme. Abilities are cast as combinations of keys rather than standard QWER setups, and since the game is fully keyboard driven, combat feels pleasantly skillful and visceral (especially with a mechanical keyboard).\n\nNegatives:\n\n-- The big one: lack of content. I know, its early access. I should be expecting a lack of content. But its still a glaring issue. A rogue-lite game NEEDS variety of enemies, loot, classes, and bosses. As this game stands, there is very little variety (however I see that there is HUGE potential for more).\n\n-- Combat. I've been a little divided on this one. I've found the combat satisfying, but also found it somewhat annoying. Because of how weapons and sprites fundamentally function in this game, combat is dictated by how well you can exploit the features of the procedurally generated terrain. This is especially obvious against bosses. But like I said, the combat still remains satisfying, I just find that it becomes less of a challenge of reflex/skill and more about knowing what kind of terrain the boss's pathing is worst at.\n\n-- Combat, part 2. Continuing on the previous note about how the terrain dictates the fight: I've found that while exploring the dungeon, it is far less dangerous WHICH enemy you find, but rather WHERE you find the enemy. Even the weakest creature in the game can kick your ass if you find it in the wrong spot (which feels really cheap, usually).\n\n-- Skills. Each class has 3 \"skill trees\". In my experience, some of the skill trees are objectively better options than the others. This makes gameplay dull. I wish the weaker skill trees were a bit more developed to become more viable.\n\n-- The game's quality seems to diminish the further you go along. I don't know if this is just something I've observed, but I've found the first stage is far more developed than the next two. Perhaps this is just once again indicative of early access. I hope the later stages are developed as well as the first.\n\nThat's about everything I can think of about this game. Do I recommend it? Yeah, absolutely. If its on sale and you like rogue-lites/dungeon crawlers? GET THIS GAME! I really hope the developers stick with it and continue to add content. So far this is one of my favorite dungeon crawlers yet.

It's the game you've wanted to be playing all of your life.  If you're into tough platformers, this is your dream game.\n\nVagante plays a bit differently than most platformers.  It rewards meticulous behavior and clear headed judgement calls.  It's not a twitch reaction speed run type game, though your reaction time will be brutally tested.  You will die often, but just as you're about to give up hope (about the 12 hour playtime mark) you'll start to improve.  Spikes will no longer kill you on 90% of your runs.  After the 20 hour playtime mark, the game will just click and Vagante becomes your go to game.\n\nThe game is entirely fair.  All the bosses I've seen so far (At this point I've got 48 hrs playtime) have been fair.  They are tough, but they have patterns and weaknesses.  Sometimes they take deaths upon deaths to learn, but the weaknesses are there.\n\nThe physics are dead on.  On a platformer the physics make or break a game.  This game has damn good physics.  You'll appreciate them more and more as you put hours into the game.\n\nThis leads me to the value of the game.  This game is a steal.  Look at the playtime of most reviewers.  There is a damn lot of bang for your buck.  At 48 hours I feel like I've just scratched the surface.  I think I'm a pretty good player, but I've yet to see the final boss.  The \"roguelike\" aspects give the game so much replayability as each playthrough feels like a different game.  The random generation algorithm on the levels is great.  Each level feels like it was handcrafted just for you.  The game isn't a traditional roguelike (example: ADOM, Caves of Qud, Brogue), but as I put it, it's as close to a roguelike as you could get and be a real time platformer.\n\nDo yourself a favor and try to not use any guides or wikis.  I feel that part of the fun in Vagante is learning these systems and the surprising ways they interact.  It's pretty fun to share \"secrets\" and strategies with a similar minded friend or two who don't use guides and wikis.\n\nCharacter building is a great aspect of the game too.  Leveling up skills lets you guide your character into your playstyle, and lets you try fun new combinations.  Want an archer mage, or a bulwark knight?  Sure, go for it.\n\nLastly, the graphics are great.  Vagante uses a pixel art style which is extremely well done.  \"Low res\" pixel art has been played out in the last few years, but this isn't \"low res\".  This is excellently crafted artwork that's done by a true pixel artist.  This would have felt right at home as a first party Genesis/SNES or later game system.  While it has pixel aesthetic, it's entirely modern and has a great scaling option for all size monitors.  I've played it on everything from a 7\" transforming tablet to a 60\" plasma television, and you can make it look great on all of these setups with minimal effort.  You just move some zoom sliders and the \"pixel perfect scaling\" checkbox.\n\nConclusion: If you like platformers, this is a no brainer.  This will become the bar to which you judge all future platformers.  Don't be scared of it being Early Access.  It's very well optimized, not buggy at all, and has more content than any similarly priced games.  As far as I'm concerned, it's a finished game, just the dev gives us new content every few weeks.  It's like getting free DLC.  The dev is great and really responsive with the community.  I don't know him or anything, but he seems like a stand up guy.  What are you waiting for adventurer?

Every type have 3 maps and unique bosses.\n\nIt's roguelike game that means if you die you need to start all over. Exept if you play whit someone (up to 4 playrs). Then after map you can be raised back from half of survivor hitpoints. Multiplayer game will reduce basic stats to balance game.\n\nLike other roguelike games this have too random map (and random loot), so every game will be different. \"C'mon life steal claw or dagger\". \n\nGame is fairly challenging and tons of fun.

Cela nous fait un total de 12 niveaux. Est-ce peu? NON! La mort n'est jamais loin...\n\nAu d\u00e9but, arriver au deuxi\u00e8me th\u00e8me est d\u00e9j\u00e0 un challenge \u00e0 cause d'une part des pi\u00e8ges tels que les pics ou les rochers qui vous tuerons en un seul coup et d'autre part \u00e0 cause des ennemis (un ensemble d'adversaires par th\u00e8me) qui fonceront sur vous d\u00e8s qu'ils vous verront.\n\nChaque niveau comporte un boss. Le vaincre vous garantira un lvl-up (maximum un par niveau). Chacun a sa m\u00e9canique propre, comprenez que le roi des bandits ne vous crachera pas de boules de feu \u00e0 la tronche mais que le dragon ne s'en privera pas et il ne se limitera pas \u00e0 \u00e7a. Un fois vaincu, r\u00e9cup\u00e9rez une cl\u00e9 et trouvez le gros coffre du niveau si ce n'est d\u00e9j\u00e0 fait; Un objet et deux potions en r\u00e9compense. \nLes niveaux sont parsem\u00e9s de boite, de petits coffres et de statues. \n\n-L'\u00e9quipement a des effets al\u00e9atoires (par exemple des gants peuvent am\u00e9liorer votre aptitude \u00e0 tirer \u00e0 l'arc ou vous faire traverser des murs (mon pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9) (clairement pas exhaustif comme ce qui suit)...\n\n-Les parchemins peuvent vous servir \u00e0 identifier un objet, en recharger un, d\u00e9voiler la carte, etc.\n\n- Les potions peuvent rendre de la vie (tient donc...) ou encore vous empoisonner vous ou votre arme. \n\nVous ne pouvez connaitre leurs effets qu'en les utilisant, les identifiant ou en les achetant chez un marchand et ils changent si vous recommencez \u00e0 cause d'une mort d\u00e9finitive. Ainsi un parchemin rouge peut \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re partie vous d\u00e9voiler la carte, \u00e0 la deuxi\u00e8me vous t\u00e9l\u00e9porter \u00e0 un endroit al\u00e9atoire et \u00e0 la troisi\u00e8me vous faire sauter jusqu'au plafond.\n\nLes statues ont chacune leur forme, nom et effet(s). Par contre ceux-ci ne varie pas entre eux, Le Bloody aura toujours la m\u00eame forme, moyen d'offrande et type de r\u00e9compense quelle que soit la partie contrairement aux potions et parchemins. Que faire avec elles? Une offrande en argent, objet ou encore en sang(=> votre vie) pour obtenir... Vous verrez!\n\nIl peut se jouer \u00e0 plusieurs en local ou online. Je n'ai test\u00e9 que le local et qu'\u00e0 deux. Je ne sais pas quel est le nombre max. de joueurs. Je suppose au moins 4.\nEn local, la cam\u00e9ra d\u00e9zoom afin que tout le monde soit toujours visble (pas comme dans Speelunky notemment ou un joueur principal est suivi par la cam\u00e9ra et les autres n'ont qu'\u00e0 suivre pour ne pas crever). Chacun est alors libre de partir de son c\u00f4t\u00e9.\n\nUn syst\u00e8me de succ\u00e8s est l\u00e0 pour pimenter vos parties d\u00e9bloquant un attribut \u00e0 choisir en m\u00eame temps que le personnage. Par exemple, je vais jouer un archer illettr\u00e9 qui commence avec 5 bombes ou un mage ayant grandi dans les livres, son intelligence augmentera les d\u00e9gats de sorts mais sa force de croquette l'handicapera au corps \u00e0 corps. Il y a une vol\u00e9e d'autres attributs comme commencer la partie \u00e0 poil ou avoir des ristournes chez le marchand. Chaque personnage peut avoir n'importe quel (mais un seul) attribut parmi ceux que vous avez d\u00e9bloqu\u00e9s.\n\nLe jeu est en anglais (un tout petit peu de fran\u00e7ais) mais il est assez intuitif pour jouer sans aucuns soucis !\n\n\nJe pense en avoir assez dit pour pr\u00e9senter bri\u00e8vement le jeu voici maintenant ce que j'en retire;\n\n\nJe viens de terminer le jeu. Apr\u00e8s avoir pass\u00e9 27 heures dessus dont une partie finale d'une demi-heure (enchainement de A \u00e0 Z), je peux vous garantir que je n'ai pas fini d'y jouer pour autant. \nJ'ai utilis\u00e9 l'archer. J'ai jou\u00e9 l'essentiel de mes parties avec lui. Chaque personnage ayant un point de skill \u00e0 donner \u00e0 l'entr\u00e9e du tout premier niveau et puis une fois par niveau acquis (exp d'ennemi ou boss) vous pourrez par exemple le jouer en vous sp\u00e9cialisant avec l'arc ou avec des attaques furtives gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 votre dague (ou gourdin, ou marteau, ou petit \u00e9p\u00e9e, ou grande \u00e9p\u00e9e, ou encore d'autres armes dont je ne connais pas le nom le jeu est tr\u00e8s riche en stuff...). \nJe trouve \u00e7a super chouette qu'en plus de faire le choix du personnage, il faut ensuite faire le choix de l'orientation de celui-ci. Encore un exemple: Mage sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9 en b\u00e2tons? Lanceurs de sorts? Alchimiste?\nVous pouvez le d\u00e9cider en fonction des objets que vous ramassez ou \u00e0 partir d'une strat\u00e9gie pr\u00e9\u00e9tablie. \n\nLa caract\u00e8re al\u00e9atoire du jeu, tant au niveau des niveaux g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9s que des objets obtenus, fait que deux parties ne seront jamais identiques ce qui lui donne une bonne dur\u00e9e de vie. En contre partie si la chance n'est pas de votre c\u00f4t\u00e9 vous pouvez \u00eatre maudits (au sens propre comme au figur\u00e9, petit exemple; \u00e9quip\u00e9 d'un item qui ne peut plus \u00eatre enlev\u00e9 et qui donne que des malus=> trouvez un moyen de l'enlever, faites avec ou mourez mouhahaha).\n\nLes m\u00e9caniques (bloquage, esquive, changement d'arme/sort, utilisation de statues, tir \u00e0 l'arc,qu\u00eates secondaires (Passez la porte d'un niveau avec une f\u00e9e d\u00e9livr\u00e9e (vivante)), combination d'objets... ET J'EN PASSE) arrivent rapidement et intuitivement. Faites cuire un poulet (vivant \u00e9galement que vous aurez r\u00e9cup\u00e9r\u00e9 de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re que la f\u00e9e) ou encore une chauve-souris gr\u00e2ce au feu de camp entre les niveaux et d\u00e9couvrez le r\u00e9sultat.\n\nJ'ai jou\u00e9 avec manette et j'ai fait deux fois le tuto pour m'habituer aux contr\u00f4les, au changement de sort/arme et surtout \u00e0 la navigation dans le menu du personnage (start pour la manette) qui n'interrompt pas le temps du jeu; Mettez-vous \u00e0 l'abri pour chipoter dans votre inventaire / utiliser votre point de niveau ou soyez rapide pour ne pas rester sans d\u00e9fense. Une fois acquis j'ai fonc\u00e9 dans le premier niveau. Je n'ai pas essay\u00e9 avec clavier. Les touches tant pour l'un que pour l'autre sont enti\u00e8rement configurables.\n\nL'ambiance sonore est remarquable. J'ai l'habitude de mettre ma propre musique par dessus la pluspart de mes jeux mais hors de question pour Vagante. \n\nLes parties sont courtes (5 - 15 min).

It\u2019s like the pixelated version of the Dark Souls\u2019 franchise you wish you could play on a potato powered by combustible lemons but couldn\u2019t because A) you had no potatoes that had a 1920x1080 LCD screen, and B) you had no combustible lemons because those were outlawed after Aperture Science used them to burn your house down.  \u2026With the lemons.  Now that I\u2019ve got your attention, my review will follow.\n\n[GRAPHICS/ART STYLE]\n\n\tThe graphics portion of Vagante is more like a lifestyle choice when someone says they\u2019re Demisexual.  They\u2019re not bad by any means but the game has its own flair and spark to it through the quirky pixelated art.  Every dungeon, though dark, bleak, grey, sad, and full of everything that wants to have you murdered so their children can live another day to avoid being grave robbed or psycho mass-murdered, it has a dilapidated feel to it, like other dungeon crawlers before you were killed there and you want to just loot their dead bodies for the stuff they were carrying.  The sprites are interesting and remind me something of Terraria in their forms.  It has a gothic, playfully serious tone to it and looks like an adventure waiting to happen.\n\n[GAMEPLAY]\n\n\tGameplay is addicting, fun, and the \u201cjust one more time\u201d kind of vibe to it.  I will say though, that the remapping the controls to your liking helps EXTREMELY unless you\u2019re used to using the D-pad to move around instead of using the left thumbstick.  The in-game text involving button use is literally \u201cbutton 1, 2, 3, 4\u201d etc. and isn\u2019t labeled as \u201cPress X, A, B, Y,\u201d etc. instead.  It\u2019s not that big of a deal but it is a little frustrating when you don\u2019t remember which button you assigned as \u201cbutton 4\u201d.\n\n\tThere are shops located around each dungeon area in which you can buy things from using the coins you just pawned off some dead creature just trying to feed its family in a run-down community home you just sacked.  You can choose to buy things or not to buy them.  Additionally, you can do neither of those things and instead kill the shopkeeper and steal all his gear.  Depending on how skilled you are at not getting crushed by surprise boulders, getting shanked by a bunch of spikes or even killed by dragons, flying eyeballs, arrows, and drowning, you can kill him.  Did I mention you will likely get killed by a boulder?\n\n\tThe leveling up system in Vagante is more akin to your traditional level-up system in any normal RPG.  You have Strength, Intelligence, etc. but also perks you can pick.  So it\u2019s akin somewhat to Fallout 4\u2019s level-up system and it\u2019s pretty damn cool.  There\u2019s not too much to say about it other than \n\n[SOUND DESIGN/MUSIC]\n\n\tI normally do not review particular sounds or music in games.  But as plain as Vagante is, it has a very fantasy like vibe.  It\u2019s not epic (lookin at you, Skyrim), it\u2019s not really a fruity fantasy thing (here\u2019s looking at you, Oblivion!), but it is\u2014as I said\u2014very gothic but not brooding.  It\u2019s an adventure.  But all the sounds and the plain music (if I recall, there is some music) all make for a wonderful atmosphere.  You spend more time concentrating on not getting crushed to death by boulders and killed by the 3rd son of the slime you murdered eight dungeons ago, but the sounds are nice to listen to.\n\nSo here\u2019s the rundown.\n\nPros:\n+ Art style is brilliant, dark, and different\n+ Gameplay is addicting\n+ Combat is plain but it helps keep you on your toes and doesn\u2019t require a lot of thinking or planning\n+ gear is not hard to come by\n\nCons:\n- buttons not labeled as on controller (not that big of a deal though)\n- Game likes to hang up a little here and there but since its early access it\u2019s forgivable\n- boulders have a higher K/D ratio than you will after two dungeon runs\n\n10/10 would get constantly killed by boulders again\n", "timestamp_created": 1457995921, "timestamp_updated": 1457995921, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "21829584": {"recommendationid": "21829584", "author": {"steamid": "76561198160018195", "num_games_owned": 184, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1727, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510122683}, "language": "english", "review": "dark souls + bro force\n\ndark bro soul force\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1457933853, "timestamp_updated": 1457933853, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "21823142": {"recommendationid": "21823142", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073262091", "num_games_owned": 179, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 3629, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510446813}, "language": "english", "review": "Atmosphere, music, gameplay and replayability are all hitting top tier for me with this game.

As with most of these types of games, there are the standard strategies involved in progression and there are rewards for grinding through countless deaths.\nWhat sets this apart other than what i consider perfectly executed atmospheric stylizations, is the fact that at no point is that great item going to make you beat the game, only make it slightly less ridiculous. And there is almost no guarantee that you will find anything useable to your current build causing you to change tactics and approach on the fly.

The perks as they are right now to say the least are pretty underwhelming and don't really change the gameplay that much sadly. Also I feel like there is a bit of a balancing issues with the classes themselves, some classes excel at combat far greater then others and some skills almost feel completely useless compared to others.

The developers are engaging their community and progressing the game - a seemingly rare occurance among Steam early access titles.\n\nThe content this game does have at the moment is enough to make the game feel mostly complete (not complete, but mostly complete). There's just enough diversity in monsters and items to keep each run-through unique and entertaining.\n\nThis game has excellent replay value. If the frustration and desire to beat this game after numerous deaths doesn't keep bringing you back, the secret content will. There are \"secret\" achievements that players can unlock within the game. These features allow you to: unlock a new class, give your character a stat-altering background story (eg., bookworm increases intelligence), or give your game certain environment effects (such as freezing time when no button is pressed).\n\nThis game has a somewhat steep learning curve, but is relatively simple once you get the hang of it.

Maybe hate it more, but still love it. Me and my brother play this, get rekt, and do it all again just for the hell of it. Surprising to see this still in development in 2014, and look where we are. Updates sastisfy me, but will this game sastisfy YOU? Well, let me explain my thoughts, to give you an impression.\n\n+ Okay Indie \"Spelunky\" RPG game.\n+ Unique playstyle.\n+ Clean graphics and art.\n+ Difficult but rewarding... sometimes.\n+ A variety of playstyles.\n+ The atmosphere of the game makes you feel pretty confident in yourself (THAT IS YOU LOSE IT ALL WHEN YOU DIE).\n+ Has average controller support (My crappy controller works on this... somehow).\n\n- Can be brutal (Seriously, you can die in seconds if you don't know what you're doing).\n- WAAAY too many spikes/traps. I bring this up because in other games, my brother and I don't come along traps very often. When we do, we are eager to avoid it. In this case, you'll be walking through the Dark Caves, super cautionously to make sure your ass doesn't get plucked with spikes.\n- You can be overpowered really quick, unless you get the proper gear when heading into the next area. If you just speedrun through all the areas, you'll get destroyed, with the exception of people who DO speedrun this... somehow.\n+/- Can be confusing with the \"worship statues\" (I call them that). The Light is to donate money to heal, and the Blacksmith is super useful when it comes to throwing away extra items. Although you won't even know what they do unless you try.\n\nIn conclusion, I stress over this game to try and do a good run. So far, I play the Knight class a lot since the sword spam lmao.

Thousands of play-throughs, solo and multiplayer.  I am now assured that I never will.\n\nIn this world of Triple-As, Clones, and MeToo Games.  Vagante is a bright diamond in an ocean of glass replicas.\n\nThe untrained eye will see a platformer, and we have many many of those.\nJust as we have many many rogue-likes.\n\nHowever, Vagante is far more than a system and an art style.\n\nThe moment you hit \" New Game \" you'll experience something; something most developers don't realize.\nYet, the movements, the mechanics, the constant attention to input/framerate timing is what most creatives don't think of.\n\nThe proper use of RNG, in creating scenarios and contexts for skill and reflexes to compensate or take advantage of.\nRather than the use of RNG in other games, to create results that make games little more than calculable slot machines.\n\nVagante is a game as all games should be designed.\n\n===\n\nEdit: 2016-12-28\n\nA few days ago, I was hosting a little get together and people were wondering what kind of game they'd like to play, we revisited Vagante.\n\nSince I had written this review, N9 have made severe changes to the game.  I honestly didn't agree with many of their changes when they were made.  Things that had made the game more enchanting were taken out ..  Like being able to steal from shopkeepers using unorthodox methods.  Certain skills were nerfed that betrayed the idea behind a class, and a control scheme that seemed like it had an identity crisis.\n\nI put the game away to finally finish TowerClimb and pick up Catacomb Kids ..  However, when I picked up the game with a group of new players who had never touched the game before I saw what N9 had in store ..  The tutorial presented that the new control scheme was a little more understandable, and although the nerfed skills hurt the idea behind certain classes they were more easily understood.\n\nI still recommend Vagante, but at this point I wouldn't call it a Rogue-Like.  It has perma-death and it's procedurally generated but Street Fighter is perma-death and Plant's vs Zombies is procedurally generated.  Vagante no longer rewards creative solutions, it's toned down it's morbid atmosphere in the old shrine designs.

grand mixture of all of my favourite games wrapped up into a neat little pixel art soup.\n\nFirstly, you have the obvious reference point: Spelunky. Where Spelunky has a defined set of rules in its physics, so too does Vagante. Where Spelunky has a defined set of rules in its items, Vagante does not, and this is the defining element when it comes to both the platforming and the combat.\n\nItems that you pick up in the procedurally generated levels are \"unidentified\". That is to say, you have no idea what they do - yet. To discover this, you have to use them, either by equipping them (Weapons/Armour), drinking them (potions) or reading them (scrolls). What they'll do is anyone's guess, but it's your only way to learn your way through items on that particular run through. This is typical of most Rogue games, but it's nice to see it makes a return here. It makes use of items a gamble. You need health, but which of these 4 potions could possibly be a health potion? Let's try this Blue one... Oh balls, I'm on fire.\n\nSo far, I've put my time into the standard Warrior class, the Ranger class and the recently unlocked \"Wildling\" who appears to be a Barbarian sort. While they all handle the same, they each have their own basic talent tree and unlockable skills. Certain weapons will also be of more benefit to certain types; an Archer, for instance, will make more use of a Bow but it doesn't stop a Warrior from using it. There's also a mage class that I'm yet to try - but again, magic is something that all classes can use, it's just that each class specialises in these areas.\n\nCombat and difficulty can, at times, hold the same feeling as Dark Souls, especially in the Warrior class. Once you unlock the block ability, you can quickly switch from attacking to blocking and back to attacking. The enemies AI is satisfactory in that it can be read predictably and therefore can be exploited when needs must. This is exceptionally helpful when the difficulty and the stakes are high, but it'll take a few runs against the same enemy to get a feel for their movement/attacks.\n\nI'm absolutely glowing about this game right now, I love the art style, love the procedurally generated levels and the unscripted nonsense that happens as enemies set off traps and kill themselves while you stand idly by. There are a couple of points which I hope to see fixed or come to the full version though:\n\nOnline Multiplayer is sorely missing as of writing this review, but I'm reading that it's on its way which will open up a whole new aspect of the game.\n\nLevelling is only done once per level - I'd much rather see this tied to a standard experience system. You won't see any great differences in your builds until you get through multiple stages with the current levelling system, but traditional XP would alleviate this and I don't feel like it would make the game any less punishing.\n\nLedge hanging - sometimes it just doesn't seem to work and I can't figure out why. I'll clear a gap and often times will only cling to a ledge if my character is about 3/4 of a sprite over the lip. This doesn't \"feel\" quite right, and I'll often fall to my death thinking that I've easily made it.\n\nAll in all though, if you're a fan of Spelunky or rogue-lite/likes in general, this is an excellent purchase - even in Early Access it's immediately playable.", "timestamp_created": 1454685920, "timestamp_updated": 1454685920, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.700904", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "20941293": {"recommendationid": "20941293", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009854709", "num_games_owned": 1681, "num_reviews": 476, "playtime_forever": 104, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470934098}, "language": "italian", "review": "MORIRE MALE DIVERTENDOSI (Vagante) - Accesso Anticipato \nVagante \u00e8 un gioco bello.

You've got your strategic elements, the option to flee from most threats until you get cornered, distinctly starting classes and intrinsic mutations, the unidentified items, wands, curses, gods and plenty of death.\n\nPeople with platforming skills should feel at an advantage playing this game over others, however, since the random map generation can often produce awkward jumps for the less-inclined to the genre, yet twitch reflexes commonly found on players of RTS or even FPS games can also help in many situations.\n\nIt is Early Access, however, so I can't really judge the game as a whole at this point. Is it fun? Yes: if you like true rogue-likes, this is definitely a good experience for you, even as a real-time action format. Is it hard? Somewhat: just like in any true rogue-like, you'll need a lot of luck on the items you find and the right strategy to deal with the monsters of the area depending on which class you picked. I personally like the music quite a bit, and the visual style is also quite polished already.\n\nI'm looking forward to seeing how the game will evolve over the course of EA. If you developers are reading this, here's what I personally think I'll want (even if post-EA):\n - More classes with different skills; the current four are good, but even more variety would be awesome.\n - Like the tutorial room, a room or room-type that lets you interact invulnerably against invulnerable creatures you've defeated at least once, as both a \"trophy\" system and a way to practice dealing with them as other classes perhaps.\n - An explanation on shrines in-game. It's not very obvious how you should interact with them for a complete newbie, and the hints on death don't really count.\n\nThis review might change if/when the game changes significantly or leaves Early Access, but it will always be a positive recommendation.\n\nIf you're not a developer of Vagante and you're still reading, buy the game!\nIf you're a developer of Vagante, keep up the good work!

The RPG elements are simple, yet have a complex and meaningful outcome as to not overcomplicate the decisions made in the leveling the process. In other words, you spend less time in \"cause\", and feel a lot more \"effect\" when spending your experience points. Your hero will develop and become powerful, while suddenly you say \"Wow, I did that?\" Many would wory that the RPG elements would make the permadeth even more frusterating... to the contrarty, the permadeth allows the player to reset and start over, learning from mistakes in a easy to use and non frustrating way. Again, simply put, the point spending in the leveling system is very simple to use, yet very effective and versatile.\n\nI take much pleasure in a game with many collectable items, gear, loot, etc... Vagante has that too. To no suprise whatsoever, it is incorperated well. The randomness of the dungeon keeps me playing. I am always all too excited to see how the levels will play out.

Kudos to them.\n\n\nOverall great roguelike. Punishing difficulty, rewarding gameplay, and local co-op! (Online co-op is still in development!)\n\nJust don't get the game if you're not into EA-games that change as it gets made, as the devs change a ton of things a lot. <:", "timestamp_created": 1450967844, "timestamp_updated": 1471969816, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500171", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "19907655": {"recommendationid": "19907655", "author": {"steamid": "76561198090158444", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2724, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467560019}, "language": "schinese", "review": "2014\u5e74\u5165\u624b\u7684\u4e00\u6b3e\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u4e5f\u662f\u6211\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b3e\u6b63\u7248\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u6301\u7eed\u4e86\u4e00\u5e74\u7684\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u8ba9\u6211\u975e\u5e38\u611f\u52a8\uff0c\u4e3a\u6b64\u6211\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2aVagante\u7c89\u4e1d\u7fa4\uff0c\u91cc\u9762\u5927\u6982\u6709100\u591a\u4f4d\u4e2d\u56fd\u4eba\uff0c\u8bf7\u5236\u4f5c\u7ec4\u7ee7\u7eed\u52a0\u6cb9\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1450965126, "timestamp_updated": 1450965126, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 25, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.753508", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "19895102": {"recommendationid": "19895102", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074321827", "num_games_owned": 383, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 400, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1455782806}, "language": "english", "review": "it's like [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/315840/]Catacomb Kids[/url] but not as good", "timestamp_created": 1450926410, "timestamp_updated": 1466059278, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510813", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "19895092": {"recommendationid": "19895092", "author": {"steamid": "76561197968758169", "num_games_owned": 135, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 6970, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501944276}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "\n\u8d70\u904e\u8def\u904e\u7d55\u5c0d\u4e0d\u8981\u932f\u904e\n\u9019\u6b3e\u756b\u98a8\u53ef\u611b\u7684Roguelike\u904a\u6232\n\u8d8a\u73a9\u6703\u767c\u73fe\u8d8a\u591a\u958b\u767c\u8005\u7684\u5de7\u601d\n\u63a8\u85a6\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1450926375, "timestamp_updated": 1450926375, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501360", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "19873987": {"recommendationid": "19873987", "author": {"steamid": "76561197981273978", "num_games_owned": 35, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1310, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500199214}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "\u00d3timo jogo, simples por\u00e9m muito divertido...

On one hand, you may delight in your developing perception and ability to anticipate monster behavior. On the other, if you're like me, you'll just lose interest every time you fall into a hole and get covered in monsters or fall onto a monster and subsequenly bounce into a spike trap. As I got better at the game, I found I could play for twenty to thirty minutes at a time but increasingly became aware of what a waste of time that made every single round.\n\nIn sum, this isn't the kind of game for people with other things to be doing.  If there was more in the way of persistent reward, I might change my mind a bit.

It suffers from the usual rogue-like problems where RNG dictates a LOT of the game (gear, map layouts, shrines, etc) but usually you can work with whatever the game gives you anyway.\n\nThe Good:\n-Diverse Ways to Play. Vagante not only has 4 classes to play, but they can be played in multiple ways. You can play this game for hours and rarely have the same playstyle happen twice in the same sitting.\n-Abundance of Danger w/o Being Unfair. This game has spikes and crushing traps that will kill you intantly, not to mention tons of arrow traps and mobs to wittle your health down. However as long as you pay attention and take your time, they are nothing more than keeping you on your toes. Relax too much, and you die.\n-Bosses. The bosses are optional big bad guys in each floor. They give you a full level and a key to open a big chest for phat lewts. I have not experienced the new Catacomb bosses yet, since the Catacombs have been owning my butt since they revamped them, but the 7 before the catacombs are very fun and challenging fights. Except the Golem Boss...screw him lol.\n-Tight Controls. Much like Spelunky, i never feel like the games' controlling mechanics screwed me over. Every time i died, i knew it was my own fault and not the game. \n\nThe Bad:\n-Bad or Useless Skills. Some of the skills you can learn when you level up are just total trash. This isnt a huge problem, since its only a glaring issue for a couple of the dozens of builds you can do, but its a problem nontheless.\n-RNG for the Wrong Class. Sometimes this happens to me where i'll play a Warrior and get Wand/Book drops left and right. Now, you should have access to everything, but i really wish it would lean more towards gear meant for that class (i.e. swords have a higher drop rate and wands have a lower drop rate as a warrior)\n-Useless Gear. Due to the way the Skills work, some gear are useless by default. Things like hammers or maces will literally never be useful to a Warrior, which makes no sense.\n-Instant Kill Blade Traps. Catacombs in the old days were more of a placeholder than an actual level. Since theyve been revamped, they are now brutal - and i mainly blame the overabundance of instantdeath traps. Spikes are one thing, but the 10 blade traps one after another while im trying to dodge a jumping Hand is just too much. Really wish they'd be toned down a bit.\n-Golem Boss. This is the only boss i have a problem with. He swings VERY rapidly and hits REALLY hard (20-28 per hit) not to mention he chucks boulders that hit just as hard with uncanny accuracy. You'd think something thats suppose to be a living rock wouldnt be so fast or accurate. The crushing thing makes total sense, and that usually never happens unless youre just ballsy stupid anyway. But he can shave your health off REEAAALLLY fast and its hard to land even a single hit without getting whacked at some point.\n\nOverall: 8/10. The game is still early access, but even as it is the game is very fun and addictive. With the exception of the Blade Trap thing i mentioned, all of my quirks can usually be ignored due to the RNG system being in your favor.", "timestamp_created": 1449551504, "timestamp_updated": 1449551504, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "19545008": {"recommendationid": "19545008", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063358168", "num_games_owned": 125, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 225, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451287291}, "language": "ukrainian", "review": "I'm just over my first hour at the time of writing.\nOH.\nMY.\nGOD.\n\nIf I had to describe to someone this game, I'd say it's like Spelunky and Dark Souls had a child, one that they threw into the black sea and cursed it as it fell.

The controls are great and it really feels like you're exploring through a labyrinthian treasure-trove.  The zones you explore feel unique and bring their own challenges:\n-The caves have instant death-traps but relatively easy enemies.  The spelunking is simple enough to ease you into the game, but watch out, there are some steep falls!\n- The forest zone has some pretty tough enemies, some of which will harass you from afar.  There are no real traps here, but some of the platforming can be treacherous.\n- The Ruins (or is it Crypt?  I don't visit often...) are definitely a challenge - unforgiving traps and enemies that will mess with your day around every corner.  The platforming here is relatively mundane though, but seriously, watch out for those traps and badguys.\n\nFinding items and equipment is one of those risky things, too, which can ramp up the tension.\n\nDefinitely a challenging game but it feels good to play.  The visuals are simply gorgeous as well, it has a really nice artstyle and the music is atmospheric, too (though I personally feel that the boss music needs to be a bit scarier or heavier).", "timestamp_created": 1448733017, "timestamp_updated": 1448733017, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "19334772": {"recommendationid": "19334772", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060809876", "num_games_owned": 67, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 2810, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511380908}, "language": "german", "review": "Amazing", "timestamp_created": 1448717366, "timestamp_updated": 1448717366, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.995005", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "19313823": {"recommendationid": "19313823", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078213915", "num_games_owned": 99, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2453, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501635917}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is great.

It's like a marriage between Risk of Rain and Rogue Legacy. The gameplay sort of \"slow and tight\" like Risk of Rain, but also manages to feel a lot more frantic and fast paced. The different classes have drastically different play styles (in a good way) but there's also the original Diablo principle of 'anyone ~CAN~ learn magic.'\n\nThe game's very challenging but also very fair. You'll get punished by visible pannel traps and realize after the fact it was in plain sight, you'll get knocked back into spikes and die and realize it's your fault for being in the wrong place at the wrong time. You'll accidentally summon/anger bosses and learn not to do those things again (or do them again on purpose if that's your thing). For me, it's the perfect level of dificulty to keep me trying and dying and trying and dying.\n\nThe 2-4 player co-op in this game is seamless and perfectly done. When a player dies, they can revive as a cannon-fodder skeleton that is essentially useless in combat but can function as a warm body to scout/distract enemies. Dead players are tactically useful, but have no 'actively powerful' impact on the game. It's a clear punishment for dying, but keeps players engaged and useful. If you're lucky, on future floors you may find items that can revive one dead player. If the entire party wipes, of course, it's game over.\n\nI highly recommend this game and really appreciate the developers for creating it.", "timestamp_created": 1447609800, "timestamp_updated": 1447609800, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.709752", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "19070574": {"recommendationid": "19070574", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003081163", "num_games_owned": 538, "num_reviews": 376, "playtime_forever": 41, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1447505561}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uac8c\uc784\uc740 \uc794\uc794\ud558\uace0 \uc88b\uc740\ub370\uc694\n\n\uc5b4\uc774\uc5c6\ub294\uac8c\n\n\uc8fd\uc73c\uba74 1\ud0c4\ubd80\ud130 \ub2e4\uc2dc\ud574\uc57c\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\n\ub85c\uadf8\ub77c\uc774\ud06c\ucc98\ub7fc \ub808\ubca8\uc774\ub098 \uc544\uc774\ud15c\uc774 \uc9c0\uc18d\ub418\ub294\uac83\ub3c4\uc544\ub2c8\ub124\ub2c8\uc5d0\uc694\n\n\uadf8\ub0e5 \uc8fd\uc73c\uba74 \uc544\uc608 \ub2e4 \ucd08\uae30\ud654 \ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\n\ub9dd\uac9c\uc774\ub124\uc694", "timestamp_created": 1447505609, "timestamp_updated": 1447505609, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.261346", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "19064794": {"recommendationid": "19064794", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079110026", "num_games_owned": 194, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 144, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1463687096}, "language": "english", "review": "Controls are infuriating and not much real substance to this game.\n\nEdit: I kindof want to get rid of this review because looking back I feel I didnt give this game enough credit.

Requesting a refund was a mistake and I should have kept this game in my Steam library.\n\nI only played this game for about an hour and a half, so I may not have the best experience of this game, but bear with me.\n\nThis game is almost all RNG. Almost. The levels, loot, one time usables like potions and scrolls, and enemies and entities like the shopkeeper and little fae girl are all RNG, and that's really all that matters. Every run is different, and because of that, it is very difficult. You may be running from an enemy down a hallway towards either more enemies, ruthless traps, or a dead end. A scroll that had the \"Health Regeneration\" effect on a previous run may have the \"Remove Curse\" effect. A helmet that you find can have any number of enchantments and effects ranging from a larger radius of light, to waterbreathing, to a Curse effect that makes you unable to remove that helmet.\n\nThere are Role-Playing Game elements in the pause menu. Equipping armor, weapons, utilities, and spells is the obvious one. At the beginning of each level, you can put one point into any one of your stats, and there are certain perks for every character at each level. Mage, for example, has the perks \"Alchemy\" \"Enchanting\" \"Spellcasting\" and \"Wand\", each of which effects something different. the first level of \"Alchemy\" makes it so all potions are identified immediately, which is extremely useful. The first level of \"Spellcasting\" makes the spells you cast stronger, and the first level of \"Wand\" increases your effectiveness with wands and staves. I cannot remember what \"Enchanting\" does, though. It was probably something to do with the various effects that you find on loot. Like I said, I only played this game for about an hour and a half before making a mistake by requesting a refund, so I do not have everything memorized.\n\nThe controls are great. Not too floaty like many modern platformers are, and not too static like I find the old Mega Man titles. My favorite feature of the control scheme is the walk button, as your default speed is run/jog. While walking, you can walk off of ledges and grip the edge of them to take a peek below you and decide whether or not you want to jump down or find another way around.\n\nThe character types are your typical Knight, Rogue, and Mage. Knight starts with a not-too-good-but-still-effective sword and defensive spells, Mage starts with a crappy staff and offensive/defensive spells that cost zero magic points, and I did not play Rogue, but judging by the character portrait it looks like Rogue would either start with an okay Bow and some Arrows or an okay Dagger of some sort, maybe both.\n\nThe color scheme is a little dark, but it fits the setting. There is a radius of light around your character that can be obstructed by obstacles, so while it is possible you can find a mapping scroll which shows you the terrain for that level, enemies and traps are still unknown to you. Not like traditional platformers where everything is all lit up and everything is visible. You should not be able to see what enemies are on a ledge directly above you, and in this game, you can't.\n\nThe only problem that I have with this game is an extremely minor one, and likely won't be implimented at all due to the sprite size, but I would like to be able to see the equipment that I put on my character on the in-game sprite.\n\nOne of the selling points is the co-op gameplay with friends, but I do not know if it is online co-op or local co-op. The HUD on the menu seems to suggest local only, but I may be wrong. If I am not wrong, then online co-op would be a very nice addition to this game that would make me play it a lot more than I would had I not been dumb and requested a refund.\n\nOverall, I would say that this is a very well put together platformer/rogue-like/dungeon crawler/role playing game.

Miraculously, the Spelunky Gods answered my prayer.\n\nImagine the exceptionally tight handling of Spelunky combined with the RPG elements of, say, Dark Souls, and you've got Vagante. Defeating massive bosses provides you with skill points to level up with at campfires that you find between stages, adding a sort of RPG level progression and skill tree to the already excellent platforming foundation of this game. Dying is permanent, and it's as painful as any hardcore roguelike. That being said, the rewards are equally gripping. Finding a magical lifesteal dagger and a good pair of wall phasing gloves rekindles any sense of lost hope from your last painful, failed mission into the depths of the Vagante ruins. The interactions with enemies is great as well \u2013 most enemies don't simply harm you when touched allowing you to learn their tells and evade many of their attacks/spells/arrows.\n\nWhile it sometimes feels the odds are unfairly stacked against you in Vagante, be sure that the Vagante Gods are watching out for you in their own bizarre way.

Even though you might get killed often, that will only make you want to do better next time. \n\n* A [b]Good level design[/b], the caves do not seem to be only randomly generated, as I did not find any way to be permanently stuck, nor did i find breakable walls that leads to nowhere, not even collision bugs. 2D games tends to have at least one or two of these spots, due to the complex space-detection-scripting.\n\n* A [b]Responsive[/b] input and also [b]very little is required to run[/b] the game.\n\n* A [b]Fair price[/b].\n\nYes, [b]the game could be a little more versatile[/b] by allowing the player to willingly travel to other locations, shops, etc...

There are three different classes, and you earn points to improve your stats and abilities. You also find a variety of new gear, potions, and scrolls, and can even pray at different shrines for different bonuses. Taken together, all of this helps makes every run feel unique because you never know what you'll find. It also gives both a sense of progression and a sense of investment in every single run.\n\nVisually, I have to say screenshots don't do this game justice. The muted colors really fit the feel, and the reason there is a lot of darkness is because you reveal the map as you explore. You can also only see what's directly in your character's line of sight (like fog of war in strategy games). It's an interesting gameplay mechanic and means you have to be extremely cautious as you proceed. The sound in the game is excellent as well, the music setting a great spooky tone and the sound effects doing their job nicely.\n\nOverall, if you are a fan of roguelikes and 2D platformers this is one for you.

get enough of this little gem right here.\nOne of a few games that I feel does everything it wants to do in a way no less than fantastic: \nPlatforming is fun and non-linear in many cases, making good use of every mechanic it has; \n\nCombat is very interesting in its positioning-focus, controlling where your enemies are in relation to you, using the level itself as protection and ways to get an advantage and it's extremely satisfatory on its own;\n\nLooting is very detailed indeed, items have often effects other than their stats that may alter the way you play the entire game very often, tons of potions and scrolls guarantee you'll never know what to expect and they are overall very creative, however weapons drop far too rarely, though.\n\nAtmosphere is incredible. I feel so immersed playing this, it does a great job at putting sound, music, visuals and gameplay together to build something more, in a very non-pretentious way.\n\nDifficulty can feel tricky at times, as it requires a different philosophy to play it. It's a game about being cautious to EVERY aspect it presents. Every mechanic can and will be used against you in case you didn't play carefully. Precise platforming is required to manipulate every combat situation to your advantage; opening menus doesn't pause the game, leaving you vulnerable; newfound items might include negative stat reductions and your field of view should really scare you as much as it does for the very first moments of the game.\n\nI'd definitely recommend this, it's all about caution, paying attention to details and being very well rewarded for exploration and manipulating the game in your favor.", "timestamp_created": 1438742859, "timestamp_updated": 1438742859, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.613212", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "17350621": {"recommendationid": "17350621", "author": {"steamid": "76561197986748778", "num_games_owned": 55, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4577, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1514336192}, "language": "english", "review": "I must admit, it took me a few tries to start to like this game.

Like FTL it's fills a niche, there's currently nothing else like it.   \nSadly i've been frutrated by the game for a while now by a few niggling game breakers which for me hold the game back from truely shining.\n\nFirstly, the lack of content.  There was a point in the development i noticed where instead of adding new content the devs began micro alterations.  this is all fine but the the time spent say, making the wizard an unecessarily complicated hero to play could have been spent adding a hero which made the muliplayer verson of the game much more playable.\n\nI love the fact that the devs have somewhat steered away from the generic theif, warrior, cleric, mage archetype dungeon crawler.. sadly, ignoring the roles that you can enjoy in a team in favor of pure RNG, without any other option really makes replay and overall enjoyment falter.\n\ni'd love to h ave a sit down with the devs as the overal arcade finish of the game is sublime.  it's purely a content/gameplay style issue here. \n\nhope you guys dont give up on it... \nfollowing is some suggestions from 2 years ago.   The tail end of a review of which i just bit the head off of.\n\nWHAT I'D CHANGE\nSkellies-\nSeeing that they only make an appearance in multiplayer and death is common, i'd change them up.  \nGrant them the ability to carry equipment (but not use) a melee weapon and a ranged weapon.  \nGranting them the ability to rigger trap.\nMake have stats which gets diminished every time they res, as they lose bones, eventually becoming a ghost.  \nGhosts can no longer carry equipment, trigger traps, but have a bright light aura and can gain agro :) \nQuickswaps- \nBeing able to bind equipment and spell configurations to the 1,2,3 & 4 keys.  \n\nGameplay settings-  \nWould be nice to be able to tweak those variables to sculpt your play groups ultimate environment.\nPermedeath is a great motivator as it makes players get \"serious\" about the environment, it becomes less of a thing if you can only ever penetrate 2 dungeons down before everyone is dead (i play with a 10 and 4yo)\n\nMOAR HEROS!\n\nThat's about it for what i feel about the game, ultimately- respect. \nThis is an awesome title, one that i am NOT refunding :D \nI hope that my support helps to see it continue developement to that sweet spot i think i feel the devs are aiming for.\n\nCheers!", "timestamp_created": 1436675814, "timestamp_updated": 1513838573, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.615476", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "16995935": {"recommendationid": "16995935", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025250936", "num_games_owned": 1346, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 3334, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497878357}, "language": "english", "review": "Oh boy! \n\nThis is rogue-like at its finest! \nAt first, I simply got it because I was in love with the pixel-art, the dark color palette and the strong atmosphere.

Regardless, it felt good to finally complete it. I have been trying to play it every once in a while after a new update is released to test the improvements, and I can say these recent improvements have been some of my favorites. \n\nNow however I fear however the game might be too easy. I think it's going to take some time readjusting it and finding the sweet spots. (I managed to find 6 death protection necklaces in one playthrough.)\n\nI do appreciate the developer's watching people's feedback, and working to find that special spot that keeps everyone happy. From the time that I first saw this on indiedb compared to now it's almost a completely different game. (The new hud looks great, and thanks for the new tooltips)\n\nI no longer seem to find random crashes. Attacks are precise, and movement is fluent. I no longer feel like the game is limiting my ability to play. Instead I feel quite the opposite. Vagante is slowly becoming quite the polished game. I think I might have been a bit drastic on my last review, as I didn't give it the level of concentration that I first started the game out with. So for that I'm sorry. The game has indeed improved a lot. (Also please don't confuse me saying the game is being polished just because the difficulty was lowered. I did make it to the very end while everything was overtuned)\n\nEvery enemy I fought now had a reasonable weakness or way that it could be killed, and I was able to find that in combat. Loot seemed way more plentiful in single player, and I also think that made a huge difference. (maybe too plentiful or we need a new way to sell gear or do something with it)\n\nOnce again though, I think lowering the enemy damage might be a bit too much. (I stormed through the final level like it was nothing, not even fearing enemies, without selecting anything in vitality. (at the end I had 130 hp)) I found the beginning levels to be much more punishing when I was without gear, rather than the other way around.\n\nAnd finally, now that I've beaten it, I can be less salty about the game's flaws and focus on the things that I like.\n\nThe classes feel unique. I'm still not certain if I'm sold on all of the talents yet, but they get the job done. The Wildling is still my favorite class, and I'm glad to see new weapons for it. Getting a 3-4 very fast speed weapon for it made all the difference in my playthrough. \n\nEach enemy has it's own unique way of being dealt with, and I like that. In previous builds, some enemies seemed either impossible to beat, or just way too confusing / full of rng / impossible to kill without losing life / not worth your time. I feel like this has been fixed in the newer builds. Each enemy also has unique ways of dealing with you, which I also like. Some are still a bit unfair, such as the giant rock tree monster being able to 999 you if he lands on you, but I understand the developers want one shot mechanics. I would say a solution to this and the problem I mentioned above would be to make death protection something you can work towards as you play, rather than rng. This would make it so if people spent extra time crafting something, collecting something, giving up something, or a mixture of all of them, then they could craft or receive a death protection item rather than ending up with a lot of them by the end of the game. \n\nI also want to say that there was a point in time where this game's ai wasn't superb, and it made it so enemies felt clunky and out of place, almost just plopped into the game. I no longer feel this way. Enemies seem to have a purpose and seem to thrive in the environments that they are put in. Skeletons still need some work though.\n\nThe item list in the game is a decent size, and I'm hoping they continue to add more. I do feel like despite getting a lot of items, I very rarely swapped to new ones though, and this kind of worries me. It made me less inclined to pick up new things. Perhaps increasing the numbers on everything so you have more room to work with numbers in general. Maybe making it so every level adds a bit to the multiplier on new items found, so as you venture deeper, you can expect to find better loot, even if it is just slightly better. \n\nI really enjoy that you can keep playing once you have beaten the game. I love that it's seamless and it just transitions into the next tier of levels, as well as having the increased difficulty. It would be nice to see additional new things on the second playthrough, third playthough, etc.\n\nAnother thing I like is that vagante doesn't try to hold the reins too much. You go in, and you view everything in real time. No cutscenes, and quests even happen without the use of interface. I hope they continue to use this, as well as find a way to non intrusively tell a story.\n\nAll in all, Vagante has undeniably given me plenty of hours of gameplay. The 15 dollars I have spent I would say is worth it, and if anything I apologize about the last review I gave. It was childish for me to not give you guys the thumbs up at this point. The game is worth the full price, and I look forward to all future updates. I really hope that you guys build a light story around the game, add more quests in the style that you have done, and continue to grow the game out, offering additional levels, new items, new classes, new npcs, and new backgrounds.\n\nAs for my wants:\n\nI still want legendary weapons, lol. This also leads to my next want...\n\nI want more / different quests. I know we get the fox quest, and this is a step in the right direction. Seeing more variety will go a long way! Finding precursors for legendaries, or special keys that unlock new areas that you can only find on your second playthrough of the game (after beating it etc) would be wonderful. I want more oh my god moments from the items / quests that I find.\n\nI still think the tarot card reader / fortune teller is a good idea. Being able to find this old hag somewhere randomly in the levels, chance to spawn that gives you a chance to pick a card, with the option of changing your background, even to ones that you can't unlock through normal play.\n\nIt would be cool to see the shrines be shrines to gods that you're praying to, and to have them as bosses.\n\nA support class would be very welcome. I would love to see a cleric / bard / shaman. \n\nI still think we should be able to turn while we are attacking.\n\nMore npcs would be appreciated, especially ones that effected your gameplay, IE a portal master that maybe asks for something and in return teleports you to a random place, maybe not even on that level. Or maybe make this a bad thing and have it so if you see a portal master, he automatically teleports you somewhere random.\n\nMaybe you find a person / object that if something happens, it curses an item. These types of things would be more than welcome. This would add to diverse gameplay, as well as making sure that no playthrough played the same. Adding enough of these into the game, and keeping their chances of happening low is going to be the key to success there.\n\nMore things like the shop keep being angry at you for the rest of the game. We need more decision making in the game, and this is something, that while annoying is exactly what we need. We need more action reaction in the game. \"if I pull this lever, level 2 will flood but a new gate will be open\"\nor \"if I scare off this npc I'll see it later on with friends\" things of this nature would be very very welcome.", "timestamp_created": 1436346719, "timestamp_updated": 1453448898, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501779",

Only L4D2 and DMC3 managed to get over the 100 hours, the first because most of my friends play it and revel in it's chaos, and the later because I'm a freaking SSS maniac obsessed with perfect ranks. Dark souls is different, it's a game for real mans, it knows it's not a casual AAA game.\nBut every other single big titles can consider themselves lucky to be even played through. And I mean, I try, sometimes I even hope it gets good, but it often fails to deliver. Even DmC was baaaaad, hell, EVEN XCOM: Enemy Unknown failed to get a second playthrough. And it's X-COM material.\n\nBut games like The Binding of Isaac? Xenonauts? Dungeons of Dredmor and Don't Starve? Terraria, Starbound, you name it. These games captivates me so much. Maybe it's because they don't treat me like a child or an idiot. Maybe they don't feel bad about beating me to the ground. Maybe they think I like it, want more, thirst for vengeance and have a chance to show the game who's behind the controller. Maybe their mojo captured my mind, their music trapping my brain...\n\nPlus these games are well made. The hundreds of items in Isaac, the 70+ classes of Dredmor, the random levels, the effect of surprise always being present, everything from the colors to the little details...How could you not love this?\n\nWell, Vagante is among these. Right in the tutorials it shows you what's up by killing you twice. There. Now you know what's gonna get you. And the first couple of runs are tough, maybe even unfair and infuriating. But then you kill your first boss. Open your first great chest. Equip that fat loot. And break your first statue.\n\n...I shouldn't have done that, I should not have done that!\n\nBut if it was only about the rad difficulty then I'd play Real-Life: The Game. Vagante has a beautiful aesthetic to it, it has an enchanting charm when you first select your characters (via tarot cards, that's pretty neatto). From there, all you see is a gaping hole in the wall daring you to go inside. The warmth of the torches begging you to stay, the vines over the remains of decaying structures saying you shouldn't be there and that little bug just minding it's own business. The game feels alive. It is a beast baiting you with items, pieces of gold, dangers and rewards. The music and the sound effects are all suiting, the characters are easily recognizable. How could you resist? So you hop in. The gap behind you shutting down, only one way to go. You brace yourself, as the environments around you changed from last time's attempt. And you know you have high chances of kicking the bucket. Yet you go stab that slime, it deserves it. Stupid slimes.\n\nVagante is not a complete game, yet it already does so much. If you think you want to try it out based on that I wrote, then you should give it a proper try.

The game in its current state is capable of keeping me occupied for minutes/hours and its still in early access. Simply amazing.\n\nBut let me share some thoughts why I (that is me, subjective) think its so good:\n - THERE IS A DEMO!!! SO I CAN TRY IT OUT BEFORE BUYING IT??? OMG!!! WHAT A GENIUS IDEA!!! Why isn't anybody doing this??? Oh, yeah...if your game sucks, people would not buy it...Anyway, a developer making a demo available is sure sign for me, that they have confident in their creation. A big plus in my eyes.\n - Level design with all its random generated goodness. Simple, yet amazing. I'm not bored! Every run feels new to me.\n - Music: its not bothering me, nice to listen to and it creates a perfect synergy with the level design. I have the feeling that I'm in a freeking dungeon or jungle.\n - Geme design. Yes, it has several elements from different games but hey, not everyone can cook. Having the right ingredients is not enough, you need to know how to mix them togheter and I think this game is delicious. Being original these days is very difficult, but thats not a problem. I don't care from where you got the idea from as long as you use them well. Trying to explain this with my cooking metaphor, I believe there are far to many ingredients already out there, so don't spend your time looking for a new one, use the existing one and make a good meal...like Vagante is. \n\nBon Appetit :) \n", "timestamp_created": 1428297075, "timestamp_updated": 1428297075, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "15220189": {"recommendationid": "15220189", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070455228", "num_games_owned": 49, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1634, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1469815305}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u30aa\u30b9\u30b9\u30e1\u3057\u307e\u3059\uff01\n\u30de\u30be\u3055\u3067\u8a00\u3048\u3070\u6e80\u70b9\u3067\u3059\n\u30de\u30eb\u30c1\u6765\u308c\u3070\u3082\u3063\u3068\u697d\u3057\u3044\u3068\u601d\u3044\u307e\u3059\n\u30bd\u30ed\u3060\u3068\u5fc3\u304c\u6298\u308c\u305f\u65b9\u3082\u5c45\u308b\u304b\u3082\u3057\u308c\u307e\u305b\u3093\u304c\n\u3053\u306e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u7dca\u5f35\u611f\u306f\u826f\u3044\u3067\u3059\uff01\n\u6b7b\u3093\u3067\u3057\u307e\u3046\u3068\u6700\u521d\u304b\u3089\u3068\u8a00\u3046\u7dca\u5f35\u611f\u3092\u6301\u3061\u306a\u304c\u3089\n\u5192\u967a\u306b\u51fa\u308b\u305d\u3057\u3066\u6b7b\u3093\u3067\u3057\u307e\u3046\u3068\u307e\u305f\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\u3068\u305f\u3081\u606f\u304c\u51fa\u308b\u304b\u3082\u3057\u308c\u307e\u305b\u3093\u304c\n\u305d\u308c\u3082\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3068\u3057\u3066\u306f\u826f\u3044\u5473\u3060\u3068\u601d\u3044\u307e\u3059\n\u307e\u3041\u30e2\u30fc\u30c9\u3067\u6b7b\u3093\u3067\u3082\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306f\u6b8b\u308b\u304c\u6700\u521d\u304b\u3089\u3068\u8a00\u3046\u30e2\u30fc\u30c9\u304c\u3042\u3063\u3066\u3082\n\u826f\u3044\u304b\u3082\u3057\u308c\u307e\u305b\u3093\u306d\n\u305b\u3063\u304b\u304f\u62fe\u3063\u305f\u5f37\u305d\u3046\u306a\u6b66\u5668\u3092\u4f7f\u308f\u305a\u306b\u6b7b\u3093\u3067\u3057\u307e\u3063\u305f\u65b9\u3082\n\u591a\u3044\u3068\u601d\u3046\u306e\u3067\u5897\u3084\u3057\u3066\u6b32\u3057\u3044\u3067\u3059\u306d\uff57\n\u3082\u3046\u5f8c\u306f\u30de\u30eb\u30c1\u3092\u65e9\u304f\u5b9f\u88c5\u3057\u3066\u6b32\u3057\u3044\u3068\u601d\u3046\u304f\u3089\u3044\u3067\u3059\n\u4f5c\u3063\u3066\u308b\u65b9\u3082\u3060\u3044\u3076\u9811\u5f35\u3063\u3066\u308b\u3068\u601d\u3046\u306e\u3067\u5fdc\u63f4\u3057\u305f\u3044\u3067\u3059\u306d", "timestamp_created": 1428245923, "timestamp_updated": 1428245923, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "15161921": {"recommendationid": "15161921", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025730472", "num_games_owned": 95, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1406, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509897526}, "language": "english", "review": "When I first played Vagante there were so many things missing that are included now but I still had an amazing time with that game.

If that doesn't convince you:\n\nControls: The controls are tight and responsive.  You'll rarelly be able to blame a death on anything except your own lack of reflexes, though there are some cases where that's not true, which I'll cover in the Difficulty section. My only gripe with the current controls is that the defaults are a bit clunky to start out with, and even after my current amount of play I've yet to master actually using all of the controls swiftly and easily. The good part, however, is that with more complex controls comes more available combinations for abilities!\n\nGraphics/Art: I personally reaaaaaaaally love the game's art style. It's dark, it's gritty, it feels... Roguelike. Unfortunately, I like character customization, which this game offers very little of. Regardless of what you wear you always look the same - if you start out as a mage and put on full plate armour, you still look like you're just wearing your robes. In the future I hope that more options for customization are offered; The current customization is only offered via a subtle change in your character's sprite color when pressing (A) before you enter the dungeon. Other than these customization bits, the art style is excellent.\n\nSound: A 4 out of 10 seems a bit harsh in hindsight, but overall, I think it's warrented until they update the game to have more music. Currently there are only a couple of audio tracks - don't get me wrong - they're good audio tracks. The problem lies in the lack of variety. Each of the 'areas' has its own little ditty, which is fine, but the ditty for that area doesn't seem to change, and after long you'll be sick of the music you hear constantly on the first few levels. I'd prefer if a few more tracks were added per area. The actual sound effects are fine as-is right now, but as always, more is better, new is .... better!\n\nAtmosphere: The atmosphere of this game is really what blows me away whenever I sit down to play it. It feels moody, lonely, and dark - a combination of feelings which led to my love for the Dark Souls series. This mostly comes down to the pixelized yet detailed art style - there simply isn't many music tracks to draw much conclusion from in this regard. I tend to play with music off because of the repetition.\n\nDifficulty: Honestly, this game has a good balance of difficulty. While it has some pitfalls - like instakill traps (which I detest) - it largely is a game where most deaths fair and player-caused, not forced on you. A lot of the difficulty also lies on the randomly-generated loot. If you're playing a warrior and find a good sword early on and put specialty points into sword, then you're going to probably have a good run. If you're a mage and you end up getting only bows on the first floor, it's going to be tough going, but it's still possibly. My MAJOR gripe about the game is the presence of TWO different sources of instant death: Pressure-plate activated stone blocks which fall from the sky and smush you, and ground-mounted spikes which will run you through if you fall on them. These would be much better if they simply did a lot of damage instead of killing you right away- plus, some randomly generated situations can actually lead to a death you couldn't prevent, like a pressure plate spawning right under another environmental piece which renders the plate invisible.\n\nProgression: In the game's current state, there is very little progression, which is a pet peeve of mine. The creator has, however, said there will be more cross-death progression in the future, so don't be disheartened if you prefer rewards for your hard-earned deaths.\n\nCombat: Combat is fairly simple, while also surprisingly complex for a 2d platformer. You start out with nothing but the basic attack your class gives you (along with a spell for mages), which consumes a whole of one (two if mage) buttons to learn. As you progress, you can place points into different 'skill sticks' (I say sticks because you don't actually have branches, you just unlock one tier to the next from 3 different 'specializations' dependant on your chosen starting class) which will often start giving you different combos or methods of attack. For example, at start, a warrior can only do left/right lunges with his/her sword, but after one point invested into the Sword specialization, you can perform a downward pogo-stick strike with your sword, unique to the class.\n\nReplayability: While you don't gain much of anything from death-to-death as of yet, the game has high replayability due to the very nature of roguelikes. Despite some lack of variety in the level generation (which will hopefully be corrected), you really will never see the same dungeon twice and it's always worth to go back and try again.\n\nPersonal Enjoyment/Overall: All in all, I really like Vagante. It holds the potential to become a platformer DCSS (One of my alltime favorite roguelikes) when it gets more content.

And also, let me tell you it is marked as one of my favorite games of all time. It takes the platforming of Spelunky and adds a nice RPG element to it, from random weapon drops to the risky testing of potions.So let me tell you why to buy this. It is cheap for the god send that it is IN BETA. Hear that? Beta. And this shit is already the Jesus baby of Spelunky and whatever sweet suckulant damsel of RPG it fornicated. It is fun, challenging and you get better the more you play. And that Jesus is still in Beta. Which means it can only get better, and thats god damned impressive.\n\nEveryone who gripes about this game seem to have the same complaints:\n\n1) The controls are not smooth.\n-I debunk that by saying that these are basic platformer layouts, apart from the special skills that require you to do a few odd combonations but are nontheless very rarely used even if you spec for them.\n\n2) The classes are not balanced.\n-They are. Save for the mage who takes some getting used to because-\n\n3) The magic system sucks.\n-This is COMPLETELY false. It has a very unique mana system, yes. Having a direct amount available for use which is regenerated by a resavoir that grows as you find secrets, explore the map, identify items, etc. Which is, by far, the most astonishingly well thought out and greatly executed mana mechanic I have ever encountered.\n\n4) Magic sucks.\n-Magic is overpowered. Spells are rare, yes. But that comes with random loot. Some spells do rediculous amounts of damage at the cost of a lot of mana to deter the user from fire blasting every slime. And for the use of everyone, wands, so as not to leave the knight out of the magic game.\n\n5) Bosses are too hard.\n-Bosses are challenging and are easily scanned for their move sets which are unique and threatening in their own ways. Kind of like Dark Souls. And like DS, you can dodge every move with ease as long as you take your time.\n\n6) Healing is too drought out.\n-Healing is as random as every other element of the game, coming from potions, fairies, equipment, and sacrificing money. Just don't get hit and you are fine.\n\n7) Instant death traps.\n-Easily identified and easily avoidable...fucking scrubs.", "timestamp_created": 1423188112, "timestamp_updated": 1423434385, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565217", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "14333645": {"recommendationid": "14333645", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026998936", "num_games_owned": 96, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 944, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1469069359}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice and challenging", "timestamp_created": 1423106812, "timestamp_updated": 1423106812, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "14312418": {"recommendationid": "14312418", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992412978", "num_games_owned": 554, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1637, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462809073}, "language": "french", "review": "Tr\u00e8s bon rogue like avec une da de toute beaut\u00e9 et une bande son sympatique abec un gameplay qui ressemble beaucoup a spelunky mais avec un c\u00f4t\u00e9 rpg qui rend le jeux vraiment sympatique je le recommande vivement !", "timestamp_created": 1422980126, "timestamp_updated": 1422980126, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "14311631": {"recommendationid": "14311631", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062046645", "num_games_owned": 139, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2730, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1446872041}, "language": "english", "review": "Vagante is awesome, I recommend it to anyone who is a fan of difficult roguelike games. This game is still in early access but there is enough content to warrant the early purchase. There are elements that still need to be improved but overall the core is very much there and extremely playable.\n\nThe controls are responsive, simple, and great on an Xbox gamepad. You can jump, melee, range, and cast magic at the press of a button; switching out weapons and magic is easy and fast with the swap button. Navigating through the inventory, magic book, and character sheet is also a breeze.\n\nAlright now for the gameplay. You can expect to die a lot. Boulder traps, spikes, even gravity can bring you to a quick end. The walk button will become your best friend when exploring and keen observation will keep you alive. Another great element in this game is using the evironment to your advantage. Scouting the entire level for the perfect spot to vanquish a difficult boss can be very rewarding. Enemies are pretty generic but provide a fair and fun challenge, also the different approaches to triggering floor bosses is interesting whether it be a sleeping dragon or angry mother worm. Loot, glorious loot! You'll find all sorts of enchanted weapons, armor, scrolls, potions, and trinkets. Some items will drastically change up your strategy and even the way you travel.\n\nThis game is still in the development process and I'm very excited to see what the creators are going to add to Vagante. Changes I would like to see are variations on enemy and boss types ala the Binding of Isaac, being able to sell your loot to the shopkeeper, and more death screen statistics. It would also be cool to see what needs to be done to unlock the unlockables but as this game is still early stage it is understandable. I can't wait for the next update!

At its core concept is a good idea for a game, whose elements are proven in other successful fun games, but unsatisfyingly combined in this one. It sits like some kind of fusion between Spelunky, Rogue's Legacy, and... well, the original Rogue. If Rogue were a 2D platformer, it be about this.\n\nUnfortunately, I feel as if the game can't decide exactly what it wants to do. Spelunky chose to be, by and large, a puzzle game, where as Rogue's Legacy is far more of an action platformer. This is most evident in two factors: the kinds of traps and environments the games employ, and the damage systems they use.\n\nVagante takes a damage system more classically RPG. You have HP, and you deal damage to enemies based upon your attack power. Different kinds of enemies take different numbers of hit to defeat, This is a perfectly functional system on its own, suitable for a more action oriented Rogue-like platformer (such as Rogue's Legacy) but the environments in Vagante suffer a number of complications.\n\n1) Poor visibility. Everything seems just a little too small in my opinion, and the color palette is sort of bland and samey. These factors combine to make a game where it's sometimes easy to miss little things. You learn to cope, but it makes the difficulty curve that much steeper. There's just little reason for a game's graphics to making it harder. Further more, the fog of war effect that limits your vision of enemies to only areas visible from your current position can cause enemies to flicker in and out of sight in a way that humans have evolved to find particularly distracting.\n\n2) Bosses. A great idea to add to games like this, the bosses are very interesting to fight, save for the fact that somewhat clunky controls make it extremely difficult to come out with much HP. The real problem with bosses in my mind comes in with the addition of...\n\n3) Instant death traps. A fine game mechanic as well, but as you vie for positions fighting bosses, it's all to easy to get tossed or knocked back or be forced to flee and find yourself instantly killed by some form of instant death trap. Have you ever noticed that platformers tend to put bosses into boxed off, isolated rooms? There's a game design reason for that besides memory. The action aspect of a boss battle combines very poorly with any form of instant death for landing on the wrong tile.\n\nUltimately, for a game that wants to feature fighting enemies, it sure chose to have slightly awkward controls. You can't run left or right while attacking, and you can't jump while in the attack animation. The most effective way to fight is to explore and  use the random environment to your advantage whenever you can, but as you knock enemies back and wait for them to jump back up toward you, you find yourself in an action game that constantly forces you to break its flow if you want to survive.\n\nFlowbreaking aside, if the instant death traps vying for mental acuity with boss fights wasn't a problem and the controls were more polished, there's an issue of damage. Healing in the game is a bit TOO scarce.

Here are my thoughts.\n\ntl;dr - Yes. Vagante is worth the purchase.\n\nPros:\n\n~ Fairly unique. You can compare Vagante to both Spelunky and Rogue Legacy, but for me Vagante leans more toward Rogue Legacy.\n~ Large replay value.\n~ Unlockable traits. Playing the game you will unlock several traits that allow your new characters certain benefits.\n~ Four classes. (Knight, Rogue, Mage, and \"???\" - of which we'll call her universal.) Each has their own unique playing style and starting equipment.\n~ Addictive. The game may cause you to mini-ragequit when you first start, but you'll start it right back up a few minutes later.\n~ Updates. This is an Early Access, but it is one of the few in which the developers actually come out w/ regular updates. I encourage you to download the version 8 edition for free from the developers main site and then purchase version 11 later. You will see a vast improvement between the two editions.\n\nCons:\n\n~ Lack of instructions. It's a very simple game to play and you will learn quickly how to do things. However, you will not learn certain things right off the bat. (I was 15 hours in before I realized what some of the altars do and how to use them.)\n~ No use for funds after a certain point. If you choose a certain trait, gold serves no purpose other than for a certain altar; which could be a game changer if you are lucky enough.\n~ Vast superiority in certain weapons over others. (You will find that you will end up using certain weapons more than others due to how they work.\n~ Organization. A little one, but still valid. You have a rather small inventory. When you equip something it \"stays\" in your inventory, rather than being linked to a character grid. Over time, you've got a full set of gear and almost no room to carry anything else. (Melee weapon, Ranged weapon, arrows/quiver/both, head, chest, feet, two rings, hands, neck/face, 5 total potions, 5 total scrolls.)\n\nAt this point I do not see why this game has so little success.

There is one camera (no splitscreen) which de-zoom/zoom to always show all the players. Some people might dislike this but for me it's the best way to handle this.\n\n[*]The singleplayer game has permadeath, but in co-op, if you die you can revive (if a living player is near you, so if all players are dead at the same time it's game over) as a skeleton. A skeleton can't wear/use/carry items, doesn't have skills and is very weak. This is an okay way to handle death in this type of games. Playing as a skeleton isn't very fun but at least you're still playing and you can get your full character back if you find a certain item (I'm not sure but I think there's one in each level if someone's dead).\n\n[*]The co-op experience is very fun. Like in Spelunky you'll have good laugh when your buddy fails miserably and makes you killed by accident (there isn't friendly-fire but clumsy people always find a way to get themself/others killed :D)\n[/list]\n\nIn conclusion I really like this game.

When you die (And you will.) you can't blame anyone but yourself, The trial & error of detecting traps & pitfalls makes one have to be very cautious with the movement. The bosses are a real challenge when you face them, whether you dodge & take potshots or get up in their face, two screw ups & you will be in a very dangerous position.

The mage is physically weak & since most enemies rush you down, the only thing to do is use up a precious wand charge or run away & use Magic Missile. Running haphazardly in Vagante either leads you being cornered or dead via spikes & boulders. A skill that can cause him to levitate would aid with reversing rushing enemies.\n\nThe hidden character is an unarmed fighter, which isn't an issue, it's that she is bland. The aspect that makes Vagante fun from my standpoint is the unique abilities of each character, she has none. I believe this can be resolved is to have her gain more affinities the higher their level. Such as, every 2-3 levels is a new skill set for her. Unarmed skills would make her more exciting, such as a combo or directional attacks.   \n\nVerdict: As it stands Vagante is an addicting game with satisfying gameplay, even though it is not finished, I am awaiting the later updates with much anticipation.\n\n7.5/10 \nWould Recommend.", "timestamp_created": 1422047113, "timestamp_updated": 1422048551, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490413", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "14126823": {"recommendationid": "14126823", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008678716", "num_games_owned": 447, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 69, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1422122495}, "language": "english", "review": "has great potential!", "timestamp_created": 1422024700, "timestamp_updated": 1422024700, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.471899", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "14113970": {"recommendationid": "14113970", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050800167", "num_games_owned": 204, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1313, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477463365}, "language": "english", "review": "If you ever wanted Spelunky the fantasy RPG, then Vagante is for you.

It has some unlockables so you don't feel like you've lost everything when you die. Anyone who likes hard rpgs will enjoy this game. Oh and I've never beaten it, with 45 hours. My friend has almost the same hours and he's never beaten it either, it's pretty hard you really have to pay attention.\n\nI'd give it a 10/10 but I'm kinda bummed about no Mac support :(\n9.99!", "timestamp_created": 1421933285, "timestamp_updated": 1449338002, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "14103558": {"recommendationid": "14103558", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029295689", "num_games_owned": 271, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 458, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496565705}, "language": "english", "review": "Just buy it already.", "timestamp_created": 1421880201, "timestamp_updated": 1421880201, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.461957", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "14094381": {"recommendationid": "14094381", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048304644", "num_games_owned": 182, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 449, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1446904795}, "language": "english", "review": "So I don't review game generally but I abolutely LOVE Vagante and I want to see it grow, so here we go.\n\nPros:\nLooks good\nChallenging\nItem diversity is good\nPlaying more doesn't unlock easier ways to play (you just have to get better)\nMultiple playstyles\nDiverse builds\n\nCons:\nMultiplayer is local only (At the moment.

View feels a bit large, making bosses less intimidating.\n\nSound: 5.0 / 5.0: Sound quality is excellent, with reminiscent 8-bit sounds, and a very impressive soundtrack.  If the developer decides to sell the OST as a bundle with the game, or even seprately, I would gladly give pay for it.\n\nControl: 4.0 / 5.0 : Controls remains lightly clunky in favor of old school charm, having you plan for every melee attack.  While this can work for enemies, it makes some boss fights challenging, where bosses are more mobile, and (because of how you move) sometimes harder to avoid.\n\nFun Factor: 4.5 / 5.0 : A wonderful game that'll have you play over and over again.  Every level up point is very rewarding. I wish there was a way to form check points in later acts so as to not start again all the way from the beginning upon failure.  Choice of weapons could help add to customability in the beginning with the game, as the sword can be a frustrating first weapon.\n\nOVERALL:  A remarkable title, with hours of fun in store.

I will not give a number score anywhere in this review. \n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1]\nVagante is a 2d rogue-lite platformer that is also a RPG. Each level is randomly generated and as of now levels are not seeded, so you cannot replay a run. This game can be played solo or up to 4 players locally (I have only played it by myself so far so I have nothing to say about the local co-op). It consists of some elements from Spelunky: arrow traps, spike pits, and the shop somewhat works like the shop in Spelunky. Currently you start off with three available characters/classes and one is unlockable. Weapons and armor are not class locked and you can find spell books, swords, tunics, and other loot in random chests through each level. Gear is also not locked off by stat requirements but you should be cautious when equipping anything since it may take away stats when it is equipped or it may be a cursed item which leads to the item being stuck on your person until the curse is removed from it via a scroll. Scrolls and potions are randomized every run like how pills are randomized in The Binding of Isaac. Everytime you start a run you start with one affinity point which you can put into an affinity (unless you are the unlockable class) or stats. There are no repeating affinities on any of the classes. \n\n[h1] Artstyle [/h1]\nI personally found the artstyle and aesthetic of Vagante to be very colorful yet still dark with the color palette. Everything looks really nice and does not blend in unless it seems to be necessary.\n\n[h1] Ending (not conclusion) [/h1]\nThank you for reading my review, if you have any criticisms about this review please comment so I can improve it.", "timestamp_created": 1420245559, "timestamp_updated": 1420246467, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.661567", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "13789877": {"recommendationid": "13789877", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032733066", "num_games_owned": 208, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 769, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480244529}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0427\u0443\u0434\u0435\u0441\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0441\u0438\u043c\u0431\u0438\u043e\u0437 Spelunky \u0441 \u0440\u043e\u0433\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u0432 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0432\u044b\u0447\u043d\u043e\u043c \u043f\u043e\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0438 (\u0441\u043a\u0438\u043b\u043b\u044b, \u0431\u0443\u0442\u044b\u043b\u043e\u0447\u043a\u0438, \u0441\u0432\u0438\u0442\u043a\u0438, \u0438\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0438\u0444\u0438\u043a\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f \u0432\u0435\u0449\u0435\u0439 \u0438 \u0442.\u0434.) \u0411\u043b\u0438\u0436\u0435 \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0433\u043e, \u043d\u0430\u0432\u0435\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0435, UnEpic.\n\u0418\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0434 \u0433\u0435\u0439\u043c\u043f\u0430\u0434. \u0418\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0444\u0435\u0439\u0441 \u043d\u0435 \u0441\u043b\u0438\u0448\u043a\u043e\u043c \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043b\u044e\u0431\u0435\u043d. \u0412\u0438\u0437\u0443\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0441\u0442\u0438\u043b\u044c: \u0442\u0435\u043c\u043d\u043e \u0438 \u043c\u0435\u043b\u043a\u043e - \u0432\u0441\u0451 \u0441\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u043d\u043e \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e, \u0447\u0442\u043e\u0431\u044b \u0431\u044b\u043b\u043e \u043d\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0444\u043e\u0440\u0442\u043d\u043e (\u0438 \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e).\n", "timestamp_created": 1420222774, "timestamp_updated": 1420222774, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 22, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.721686", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "13769305": {"recommendationid": "13769305", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036955580", "num_games_owned": 119, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 441, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1457583839}, "language": "english", "review": "Hard game, died in tutorial.

While it lacks the turn-based and top-down gameplay that define the genre, pretty much every other aspect of the genre is retained. The procedural generation of levels is executed perfectly, as the levels are challenging and look good. Loot is randomly generated in true roguelike fashion, where nothing is identified until you use it, or if you cast from an identification scroll. This goes for potions as well, of which the color never indicates what type of potion you find between runs.\n\nItemization so far has been pretty great. The items not only offer random stat upgrades, some of them also offer platforming assistance (to some extent) and other abilities. For instance, it is possible to find gloves that allow you to grab hold of walls, boots that allow you to bounce around or leave a trail of fire, a grappling hook, and even items that allow you to phase through walls and floors. If you're a dumbass like myself, you'll find yourself phasing through the edge of the level by accident, killing yourself in the process. There are many more items like this, and I haven't even gotten that far into the game.\n\nThe fact that there's more to items than just numbers makes itemization in this game a LOT more interesting.\n\n[h1]Controls[/h1]\nThe game controls feel a lot like spelunky, which makes it a bit clunky in combat. The clunkiness, however, is rather charming. While I personally opted not to play a knight as the rogue's dagger is much faster (and thus hits the opponent when I press the button, not half a second later), once you get used to the controls the game should feel natural to play.\n\nThe controls can be rebound from the menu, and it's possible to use a controller (which I would recommend for this game, although it is certainly not necessary).\n\n[h1]Co-op[/h1]\nThe fact that this game has local co-op makes it all that much better. I have only seen co-op in videos, as I haven't yet had the chance to play this game with friends. The videos show that if one of the players dies, he is 'resurrected' as a skeleton, with some chances to return back to life as a player. This means that dead players can still help, but would much rather be alive since living characters have more to offer.\n\n[h1]Difficulty[/h1]\nThe game is quite difficult. At the very beginning you lack the gear to withstand a lot of punishment. Each level contains a boss, and if you can't find a way to cheese the boss, they can be quite a challenge. Difficulty also hinges a lot on the item drops you get. Getting health potions early on helps a lot, as well as items giving you higher defense, or more attack power.\n\n[h1]Final Judgement[/h1]\n\n[b]The Good[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Fantastic gameplay; it resembles a rogue-like more than most games calling themselves roguelikes\n[*] Consistent quality of graphics; the game looks great for those loving the NES/SNES era type graphics\n[*] It has co-op!\n[*] It's quite difficult\n[/list]\n\n[b]The Bad[/b]\n[list]\n[*] The controls are a bit clunky, making combat harder than it should be. Especially with a sword, you really have to get used to the timing, otherwise enemies will chip away your health before you can even finish the first level. It's not a deal-breaker, though, as the controls are not unfair or unresponsive.\n[*] It's quite difficult\n[/list]\n\nThis game is an absolute recommendation for those enjoying 2D platformers with a mean streak. It also has co-op! What else could you wish for? The co-op is still limited only to local, but on the discussion board the developer mentioned making online co-op.

They started up a Kickstarter that sadly failed so I'm really glad to see it finally up on Steam. I originally backed it and was super hyped about it so I'm more than happy to support the development of this game. I absolutely recommend this game for any fans of Spelunky, roguelikes, or just enjoy a nice difficult game. Would I recommend it for it's current price? Probably not. I don't think it has enough features to necessitate a $15 price tag. Why did I buy it? Purely because I want to support it's development. They also have a free demo on their site if you want to give that a look. I recommend trying that out before buying it to see if you'll truly enjoy it.\n\nGameplay is great. If you've played Spelunky then you'll get a hang of the controls just fine. Has really good controller support too which I highly recommend using. Each class you choose from pretty much handles the same at the start. There's three to begin with (knight, rogue, mage) and you can unlock more as you play. I'm not sure how much there is currently in the unlockables department but I really hope they just load the hell out of this game with them because this is the perfect type of game for it. You can even unlock different backgrounds. I unlocked Deprived which starts you off with no items at all (a nod to Dark Souls I'd imagine).\nBasically you go through randomly generated areas slaying monsters with a pretty diverse arsenal of weaponry and spells to gain levels and loot. To gain levels it's almost mandatory that you kill the boss in each area but you only level up once you transition to the next floor which will allow you to distribute a point in either a new ability or into one of your stats. Along with loads of xp the boss also drops a key that'll allow you to unlock a super chest tucked away somewhere on each level. There's a decent amount of crates to smash and chests to loot but there's also a shop very similar to Spelunky's. \nThe difficulty is fair and makes the game challenging enough that it'll keep you hooked. Easy mechanics that are difficult to master. There's quite a few things that can kill you in one hit. Mostly spike traps. It may take you a while before you're used to how to handle areas with spike traps but don't give up. \nThey also plan on adding in online multiplayer to go along with the local multiplayer they already have. They've already changed up the gameplay to facilitate multiplayer so I assume now they're just adding in netcode which is a huge thing. \n\nI tried really hard to think of something I don't like about this game. I think my only real gripe is that all the monsters are just generic fantasy creatures. You got slimes, goblins, bats etc. I can understand why they would make it this way though. They do fit into the theme really well. I'd also like to have sounds play when a creature is defeated. In Dark Souls when you kill something they play a really satisfying slashy noise but in this they don't really make a sound.

[b]The game is still in an early state, and this review will be heavily modified and added upon as development continues.[/b]\n\nVagante is an action platformer with procedurally generated stages and perma-deaths , making this absolutely imperative for any enthusiast of games with roguelike elements. The game is very akin to Spelunky in terms of its random maze-like passages sprinkled with difficult enemies, and its maiden rescuing side objectives. The controls and platforming are smooth, combat is simple and fun, and your skills and equipment actually have a noticeable impact on your current run. \n\nYour consecutive runs will be incredibly difficult with narrow and claustrophobic corridors trapping you between numbers of varied monsters. As challenging as it is on the surface there is a slew of options available for your survival from leveling up important life-saving skills and abilities to finding or buying very useful equipment from the merchant which keep the game increasingly addictive in its progression, exploration and discovery.\n\nThe level and character designs in Vagante are stunning while retaining a simple indie game charm and the very well-done character portraits of the distinctly different classes you can choose in particular are reminiscent to me of the most memorable mid-to-late 90s era JRPG designs, with lovely organic background art in the eye-catching title screen almost akin to series like Secret of Mana/Seiken Densetsu.\n\nThe music also follows the same attractively unique yet familiar territory into RPG classics, the natural wood and string instruments sounding to me almost like tracks you would expect out of the likes of Yasunori Mitsuda's Chrono Cross soundtrack. Long story short, even in its earliest form Vagante already has the makings of a classic.\n\nVagante is in an alpha state currently, and is already very hard to find any faults with other than the fact that it's early and still has lots more incredible content to come. With the nostalgic visuals and music combined with fun, precise and easy to pick up but challenging to master randomized gameplay this is a title I'm certain could become the next 'big' roguelite.

There are 3 starting classes, rogue, warrior, and mage, that are exactly how you think they would be.  Don't let that stop you from playing a magic warrior though! (Really not a good idea though haha)  The item system is random enough where each playthrough will feel different, but it can be pretty punishing if the RNG gods are against you.  The controls are fluid and combat is simplistic yet feels really good.  Face tanking damage will quickly end your run (and death is permanent!) so don't do it.  If you enjoy other roguelikes or like being challenged, I would recommend checking this title out.  \n\n8.5/10 would play again", "timestamp_created": 1418780942, "timestamp_updated": 1418780942, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541372", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "13410508": {"recommendationid": "13410508", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961521131", "num_games_owned": 1020, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1677, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485619492}, "language": "english", "review": "I've been following and playing this since their first public alpha, and I easily have 50+ hours into it before it was released on Steam.

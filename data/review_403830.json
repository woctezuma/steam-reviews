Even the clunky combat system people often criticise helps to sell this feeling of helplessness, the lack of sophistication makes it a lot harder to win when facing multiple monsters, and thus makes me dread running into them all the more. I don't know if this is by design, but it works anyway.\n\nThe graphics are the one thing I'd say I outright dislike. I appreciate giving them a somewhat rough feel to add to the mood, but there were far better ways to do it than what we ended up with, as many have pointed out, it very much looks like a Newgrounds flash game from the early 2000s. I wish Yahtzee had hired an artist to handle the graphics, I know he's handled them for his previous games (which I also enjoy), but they aren't up to the standard I'd expect from a \u00a36.99 Steam purchase. They didn't bother me too much all things considered, but they seem to have turned a lot of people off, and it's a shame that many haven't experienced this game because of them. \n\nOn the positive side, I really felt like a detective when putting clues together for my tablet, it's a small thing, but the fact that the game allows you to work things out and alter it yourself based on the clues you receive helps in making you feel like you're really deducing  things instead of being spoon-fed (I imagine a mainstream game would've automatically filled it in as you found things.) While I definitely see fault in the combat and presentation, this core game-play mechanic was incredibly satisfying, I'd whoop with joy whenever I found a new clue, the oppressive atmosphere makes these moments all the more joyous, a glimpse of hope in the relentless darkness.\n\nOverall, I'd give the game a solid 8, I've enjoyed playing it, and hope to play it many more times.", "timestamp_created": 1512675462, "timestamp_updated": 1512676047, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37673771": {"recommendationid": "37673771", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991766855", "num_games_owned": 108, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 600, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509875140}, "language": "finnish", "review": "The Consuming Shadow is a very interesting game.

En serio.\nYo reconozco que no es un juego que le vaya a gustar a todo el mundo. Es simple, de gr\u00e1ficos cutres y con una mec\u00e1nica de combate que roza lo minimalista, pero tiene algo que lo hace muy especial.\n\nPara empezar, ni siquiera sabes cu\u00e1l es tu objetivo una vez que empiezas el juego. S\u00ed, sabes que un dios malvado quiere entrar por una grieta dimensional e invadir este mundo. Sabes d\u00f3nde est\u00e1 la localizaci\u00f3n de esa grieta. Pero ah\u00ed acaba todo. No tienes ni idea de qu\u00e9 dios es, ni de c\u00f3mo detenerlo. Tu objetivo, pues, es recopilar pistas para ir todo lo preparado posible al lugar de la invasi\u00f3n antes de que \u00e9sta se produzca (tienes unas 60 horas ficticias).\n\nC\u00f3mo se hace eso? Yendo de pueblo en pueblo (t\u00fa eliges la ruta) intentando ayudar a todos en tu camino y a la vez recopilando pistas que vas anotando t\u00fa mismo en una especie de cuaderno. La gracia est\u00e1 en que todas las pistas cambian de un juego a otro y por lo tanto no valen de una a otra partida, si no que cada vez que juegas hay que investigar.\n\nTodo esto hace que el juego se distancie por completo de las mec\u00e1nicas convencionales de los juegos de terror. El juego no trata de idiota al jugador, si no que este tiene que tirar de coco para poder tener una m\u00ednima posibilidad contra las hordas de la oscuridad.\n\nLos monstruos que te encuentras, as\u00ed como la ambientaci\u00f3n y el tema de la cordura (sanity) me recuerdan mucho al universo de Lovecraft, y de hecho, a falta de que lo confirme, es muy posible que fuera la intenci\u00f3n de los desarrolladores. \n\nLos combates ya he dicho que son muy simplones. Tienes tres formas de matar a los monstruos; cuerpo a cuerpo, con balas de tu revolver o con conjuros. Es un aspecto que flojea, pero me da la impresi\u00f3n de que lo importante del juego es la gesti\u00f3n de tus recursos, m\u00e1s que tu destreza luchando.

I also wish the game had a bit more variety to it which would make more playthroughs diffirent with more variety.\n\n7/10", "timestamp_created": 1499706293, "timestamp_updated": 1499706293, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496654", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33373152": {"recommendationid": "33373152", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041300903", "num_games_owned": 415, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 822, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499762782}, "language": "english", "review": "I shot myself in the head accidentally. 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1499517939, "timestamp_updated": 1499517939, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33335459": {"recommendationid": "33335459", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076103721", "num_games_owned": 92, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 7, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499412012}, "language": "english", "review": "Doesn't work with windows 10.

Hopefully bits of it are useful to you. I'll say right up front that I've really been enjoying playing the game.\n\nIndividual playthroughs are quite fast. I ate pavement, brutally, on my first several tries at this game, followed by a few more tries where I ran out of time before running out of health for a change. By then I'd unlocked another character whose style suits me much better, and at that point managed a full game and banishment (but not the optimal ending) in my first 6.7 hours of gameplay. There have been $60-release titles that lasted about that long before I was done with them, so this was a good start.\n\nCombat, like the graphics, is pretty bare-bones, but both get the job done. I'll say this for the art: The shadowy figures of the playable characters, however 'creator cannot art' they may be, suit the kind of game that it is. It's not about them, it's about saving the world from falling into shadow as they slowly slide into madness along the way. Sometimes madness gets the upper hand...\n\nThe music provides a nicely atmospheric backdrop to the game, without being distracting or annoying, speaking as someone who gets fed up and turns the music off, or at least the combat music, in more games than where I don't. The flip side of this is that I couldn't find an option to turn down or off only the music and not all ingame sound. Because there's, sensibly, no music to speak of in areas where combat occurs, this isn't a deal breaker for me. If you do tire of the music, you can turn sound off everywhere else, and turn it on for those parts where being able to hear enemies can save you some pain and Sanity. It's a functional solution, though not ideal.\n\nI'm more annoyed that, if it's possible to re-map the game controls, I couldn't determine how. Clicking on them in the controls list does nothing. That's my biggest negative point about this game, since for me, it makes the combat more awkward than it needs to be. It's also a personal pet peeve, so take with the appropriate number of grains of salt.\n\nThe rest of the interface can be a bit awkward (I'm keyboarding) but I've only had serious trouble once. I managed to backstep my character and get wedged at the entrance to a dungeon I'd just entered, with it throwing the flee-or-proceed window at me over and over each time I opted to stay. I managed to wriggle him loose somehow after several minutes and carry on.\n\nThe birth stars mechanic is interesting, making even failed attempts on a character gradually count toward scrabbling your way to a win on future attempts. I like that, and also like that placements aren't set in stone forever, but assigned again at the start of each playthrough. I haven't tried the challenge modes yet, but they look promising.\n\n[Edited to add additional observations, including...]  I'd held off looking at the diary entries until I had all of the earliest ones and could read the first chunk of them in order. Like a lot of random document backstory stuff, reading them is optional, but I'm enjoying getting the rest of the story. It's added flavor to subsequent playthroughs.\n\nThe design of the game includes few guarantees; I had to walk into the final confrontation with a best guess based on evidence, because the random clues hadn't given me confirmation of the name. They'd given me enough that I was almost sure I was right, though, and when it turned out I was, that was more fun than just go-here-go-there-ok-got-all-the-parts-now-hit-combine-for-the-win. Or to put it another way, I may have yelled a few triumphant expletives at the end when the incantation worked.  ;D  I have yet to get impossibly stuck, being a victim of my own time management or combat skills aside.\n\nI expect I'll be yelling a lot more angrily if the randomized bits result in me taking a flying leap into doom and failure, and they were the source of the time-ran-out losses I've had so far: I got caught too far out to drive to the end location after I hunted for one more useful clue. \n\n[LATER EDIT: I finally did it, I failed a run so hard that even an educated guess was probably beyond hope. The random towns I picked to go to kept being not-yet-darknessized when I didn't have any funds or clues yet and really needed some. And the ones that were in trouble which the game directed me to gave me clues that weren't filling in the blanks I needed. Losing this way was less irritating than I expected it to be, partly because even though I failed miserably, I got a respectable pile of XP from the effort, and partly because it was stiill fun even when I realized, 8 hours from impending doom, that I wasn't going to pull this one off.]\n\nBut the neat twist is that, as long as you don't push your luck past breaking with the timeclock to get there, you can always go at the final boss with a guess at the bits you're missing. So, The Consuming Shadow doesn't easily leave you stuck at a boss fight you have NO way to win. (\"Not easily\" isn't the same as \"doesn't ever\", but it'll do!) That's more than I can say for FTL:Faster Than Light, which I do like, but which has a real habit of randomizing its way to a fatal smack against a brick wall. (Also, just because I'm yelling at a game doesn't necessarily mean the game sucks. If I'm invested enough to yell, then that's at least one point in the positive column.)\n\nI did flounder a bit on my first go at The Consuming Shadow's end scenario, but I also think I know what I missed, which I like better than \"Boss destroyed me. Gee, wish I knew why\". And it was still a win, if a sloppy one! I'll see if I was right the next time I get there. [Edit: Having seen the end engagement again, I was right, I did miss something that first time. It was a fun \"ah-HA, I see now\" moment.]\n\nOh yes, there will be a next time. I unlocked a third character on that one victorious run, and I'm not done with the first two yet. So I'd say that The Consuming Shadow is definitely worth a try. \n\n[Edit/P.S.: The third character is fun as well, but the second remains my favorite. On the other hand, if I'd been playing the third character I unlocked, that catastrophically failed playthrough I recently had might have ended very differently...]", "timestamp_created": 1498281016, "timestamp_updated": 1502564636, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 30, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.723757", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32206010": {"recommendationid": "32206010", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983693357", "num_games_owned": 142, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 981, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512060375}, "language": "english", "review": "Not the best when it comes to the visuals, but the atmosphere and gameplay is amazing.\n\nIf you love survival horror and lovecraftian themes, this is the game for you.", "timestamp_created": 1496688883, "timestamp_updated": 1496688883, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543568", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32046576": {"recommendationid": "32046576", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032081181", "num_games_owned": 185, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 606, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496175090}, "language": "english", "review": "Pros:\n-Unique and organic logic puzzle-based gameplay\n-Satisfying to master the combat system\nCons:\n-Graphics\n-Game games stale after maybe 4 hours of gameplay\n\nNot very scary after the first ten minutes or so, but that's not really what I'm here for.\nIt's a pretty decent survival game (though it gets dramatically easier after you play for an hour or so and your character permanently 'levels up' a few times), and an adequate procedurally generated dungeon crawl.\nThe coolest part of the game is by far how it incorporates logic puzzles.

The game shines in that regard, as there is a constant feeling of tension when you investigate a location, looking for clues. Limited visibility, ammunition and (especially in the beginning of the game) frailty of both body and mind only add to this, and in a good way.\n\nThe overall gist of the game is this: there is an Ancient God that is trying to invade the world, and you have 60 hours to banish it. Who, or what, the God that is invading is, you don't know. By solving and completing dungeons/quests, you will get clues that push you in the right direction. But even if you have deduced everything correctly, you still need to make an educated guess. And that is what you do in the game's only permanent location: Stonehenge. If you deduced the clues right and got the correct Ritual of Banishment, you have a chance to save the world. In all other cases, you don't.\n\nThe game is procedurally generated, and everything is random when you start a new game (except Stonehenge). Locations will have monsters, clues and other helpful items, there will be random encounters when you travel between locations, your phone will receive texts which can be either good or bad... and that is only scratching what this game has to offer. You can even unlock 3 additional characters with each of them having their pros and cons, plus a challenge mode, which add replayability. And after each time you finish a game (good or bad), you will gain points which will level up your chosen character.

I gave this review the title it has not because The Consuming Shadow is an exercise in minimalist design, but because it\u2019s executes a dizzying level of subtly and complexity through it. One of the first things you notice when opening the main menu is a rather simplistic two-dimensional art style. I would argue that not only does this not take away from the horror experience, it actually can and will add to it. Here in the main menu you see the player character hunched over a desk in a nearly pitch black room giving a basic summary of plot details. A shadow(see game name if this was a genuine surprise to you) has fallen over jolly ol\u2019 Enlgand and you 'The Scholar\u2019 has been tasked by the Ministry of Occultism with putting an end to it. Within the menu itself you have the option of beginning your journey or killing yourself. This is a masterfully crafted execution of both the games tone, and one of it\u2019s central game play mechanics. Clicking on 'Kill Yourself\u201d starts a mini-game where you frantically tap the mouse to keep a silhouette of your character from putting a gun to their head and pulling the trigger...obviously. After you begin your journey you find in yourself in your car with a map of England and a variety of towns. You will notice a sixty hour timer on your screen. Time management is a factor here. If you fail to die within sixty hours, the invading god will do what he does. Which is invading. Also here is another great moment of subtly. In your rear view mirror is a post it note with the words \u201cDon\u2019t look back\u201d written on it. At first it seems almost whimsical, but as your sanity wanes you start to see it as a call for clarity in a world going mad. Your car is where you can heal from a refillable med-kit, and take narcotics to temporarily restore sanity with diminishing returns. You can find your book of clues and a spell book. Clues will logged as you find them. They are integral to completing the game. You need to discern the identity of the invading god and the correct runes needed for his banishment ritual. This segues nicely into your spell book. Here you keep all the spells you have learned and more importantly, your knowledge of what runes are needed for the banishment ritual. You will also receive texts from time to time in your car. They run the gamut of job offers from the ministry, family texts that can or subtract sanity and random numbers or threats from cultists. Also you can sort through equipment you find in dungeons and purchase from towns. These while not necessary, they can extremely useful.  This section of the game has a somewhat Oregon Trail feel with traveling from town to town(albeit in a non-linear fashion) while coming across a variety of random encounters along the way. Towns themselves will consist of either friendly towns or towns that have fallen to the shadow. Friendly towns give you the option to scavenge for supplies and a hospital for mending wounds, refilling med-kits and buying more drugs. All of this is conveyed through a simple but well executed silhouettes of towns with accompanying text. Fallen towns are where the meat of the game-play is located. Here you will find \u201cdungeons\u201d consisting of various realistic settings like hospitals, parks and warehouses. Objectives will be rescuing a hostage, closing a dimensional rift, defeating a large creature or finding an important artifact. I am going to leave an important note here, imagine it as a post it note on your rear-view mirror. You, will, die. You will die a lot. It is not simply a Dark Souls combat style of masochist difficulty, it is a central game-play mechanic. Completing dungeons, killing monsters and piecing together clues about the impending gods arrival all give you experience. The difference here is, you only level up when you die. Every level unlocks birth signs which are used to boost your stats at the beginning of each new journey. Birth signs are placed in the sky near astrological symbols which confer health and sanity bonuses, to other things like loot drops, research buffs, spell effectiveness and larger ammo capacity. Combat consists of using your 9.mm pistols for ranged, or pistol whipping for melee. Here lies one of my favorite aspects of Consuming Shadow and one of my favorite types of horror game combat in general. Combat in horror usually falls into one of three categories. On one extreme you have the Outlast/Amnesia style horror combat, where there is basically no combat. Your a wet paper bag lost in the wrong side of town. You stealth about and run when you realize you suck at sneaking. On the other end is the Doom 3/Dead Space style combat. Your a sentient oil drum filled to the brim with whoop ass. you mow down all sorts of monstrosities and neer\u2019do\u2019wells with gleeful abandon. The Consuming Shadow falls into that happy medium between the two ala Resident Evil 1-3 or Zombi. A wonderful chunk of corned beef and sour-kraut between two slices of wholly different loaves of bread. You have means of defending yourself, sometimes it is the better option. Other times, it is not. The dungeons are procedurally generated making each play through fresh and new. Here you will encounter various ghastly creatures and occasional cultists; human foes who cast profane magic at you. Taking damage or leaving rooms with enemies in them result in sanity loss(among other ways) While sanity mechanics have been implemented in other games, I find Consuming Shadow executes it almost to perfection. As your sanity drains, a whole host of uncanny visual effects begin happening. Translucent black botches appear on the screen, a grain effect fades in an out. Sometimes the silhouette of your character will disappear entirely, doors will shift about and enemies that only exist in your mind will appear. While are all well and good despite being cribbed to some level from Eternal Darkness, there are other sanity effects that nail the atmosphere and horror like a professional sniper. One in particular is when the objective text at the beginning of a dungeon is replaced with \u201ckill yourself\u201d \u201cdie die die\u201d etc, only to seamlessly transition back into the normal text while your reading it. The other major one is far more sinister. Various commands in the town and car sections will randomly be replaced with the \u201cKill Yourself\u201d command for a few moments. You will accidently hit this. If you succeed at pulling the gun from your throat, you have a high chance at recovering some sanity, But, it gets progressively harder every time you enter the mini-game. While It is never stated in any way, a lot of background story telling is at play here when infer that even when you are completely out of ammo, you still have one bullet left. It is a great reinforcement of the despair and morbid atmosphere in this game. Even when your characters head is held high, they still know in the back of their mind the only fail safe way to save themselves from the darkness is to simply end it all. The endgame of all this is to discover enough clues about who the invading god is to form the correct banishment ritual. The place of his summoning will always be found at Stonehenge, the farthest point from where your journey begins. You can also learn an assortment of spells for different situations by combining the runes you encounter throughout the game. The trade off is, they cost sanity to use. Which you will soon find out, sanity is a priceless commodity in short supply. When you die, or complete the game(you lucky bugger) your\u2019re presented with a rundown of your characters actions. This is one of many moments where Yahtzee really flexes his writing chops and despite their random nature, I found all of them compelling and enjoyable.

I opened my review with that sentence because at the time this game came out, I was absolutely enraged to see much of the internet tout graphics as this game's fatal flaw.  What those brainless twats don't realize is fuck graphics - [i]The Consuming Shadow[/i] is all about gameplay... and its sopping with it.  \n\n[h1]With that done, now the actual review.[/h1]\n\nYour goal is to save the Earth from impending doom at the hands of an unknown deity.  Standing in your way are hordes of monsters, an ever-looming time limit, and your own rapidly deteriorating mental-state.  Insanity plays a huge role in [i]The Consuming Shadow[/i], as well it should in any game with a mythos inspired by H. P. Lovecraft, and your character will, indeed, start seeing shit that is not real, become less efficient in combat, and might even attempt to take his or her own life... just, kinda outta the blue... or because a dialogue box turned to \"kill yourself\" without you noticing, sending the player off tap-tap-tapping furiously away at the A key to not die.\n\nThe game is set across England and you'll travel between fictional cities, procedurually laid out on the map, collecting supplies, completing quests, and finding clues as to just who or what is trying to destroy everything.  Combat is profficiently done in a two-dimensional side-scrolling style with the three main flavors being melee (pistol-whipping), ranged (shooting said pistol), and spells (which don't, to my knowledge, involve the pistol in any way).  Items that you can scavenge include three different kinds of ammunition for your pistol, various different upgrades to both yourself and your vehicle, and [b]illegal drugs[/b] (because how else do [i]you[/i] temporarily manage your sanity?)  The last pillar of gameplay are the clues to who is invading reality and this is where the genius of [i]The Consuming Shadow[/i] shines it's brightest.  Each clue you scavenge is in a form like what you would see in a logic puzzle.  For instance, let's say you found a clue: \"Chzo hates knobs,\" and you already had, \"the god who hates knobs owes you twenty bucks.\"  So after contemplating why it is Chzo doesn't like knobs and when it was you lent him money, you can access the handy in-game fact table from the menu and mark down that information for later.  I've always said, \"the only way to improve logic puzzles are to add violence, drugs, and existential statements on reality\" and I now see that I was right all along and not just weird or something.\n\nBeing procedural and very [i]Rogue[/i]-ish, there's a lot of fun to be had just playing the main game, especially with unlockable characters and different play-styles, but [i]The Consuming Shadow[/i] also includes two different types of challenge modes, one of which involves descending into an infinitely-deep dungeon a-la [i]Nethack[/i].  Very, very replayable.  I managed to annoy someone into giving me a pirate copy when this first released, and over the course of the past year, I've played it enough off and on that when I finally got my finances sorted, it wasn't just a since of duty to the artist that I legitly purchased this game.\n\nYahtzee Croshaw is the rare type of critic whose talent and skill does not begin and end at the analyzing of other works.

The UI is also decent, though the inventory navigation is a little unintuitive, you click on the slot you want to swap out and then have to select from the inventory the item you want to swap it with instead of just a drag and drop situation. I dunno.\n\nStory, yeah I mean with we're talking about lore it's pretty solid, it doesn't try to force feed it to you but sorta offers it on the side like, \"Here is the main course and beside it is a rather lovely sauce to give the meal context if you like.\" So yeah. Also the writing it good too.\n\nGameplay-wise it fits a horror setting (in my view) in that ammo is relatively scarce, though that can fluctuate depending on the seed (more on that below), and the combat itself is clunky but managable. The game punishes you for fleeing but not in a completely unmanagable way and more as an incentive to fight the horror. \n\nRogue-like elements, including the meta-game progression in the form of birth stars which are allocated before each game and give buffs, are pretty well done though I can see how eventually they may become over-powering. You can delete your history on the game, resetting you, but I guess the life of a rogue-like will inherently depend on how long it takes for you to get bored with it (maybe, I'm not an expert).\n\nOverall, decent enough if you can look past the graphics. Tonally it's consistent, with a focus on prioritisation (personal surivival vs. being a decent person for a bunch of sprites) as well as with an heavy weightiness to it (bad description, think Silent Hill 2?). Um, so yeah, thanks for reading all of this.

You start your journey with next to no information (unless you play as a specific unlockable character) only the knowledge that the world is coming to an end in three days, a car, and some cash in your pocket.

Die Grafik dagegen ist minimalistisch, aber stimmig.\nDas Gameplay besteht daraus, unter Zeitdruck Orte in Britannien abzufahren. Entweder man trifft unterwegs in interessanten Begegnungen Entscheidungen (deren Ergebnisse nicht immer gleich sind), f\u00fcllt in sicheren St\u00e4dten seine Vorr\u00e4te auf oder betritt Dungeons in vom Schatten befallenen Gegenden, um die Runen f\u00fcr das jeden Durchgang variierende, n\u00f6tige Bannritual und den zu verbannenden Gott zu recherchieren. Nat\u00fcrlich bek\u00e4mpft man auch Monster mittels Pistole, Nahkampf und Magie und l00tet, was das Zeug h\u00e4lt. Es macht Spa\u00df, die Schwachstellen einiger Gegner herauszufinden, aber das System an sich ist nicht sehr anspruchsvoll.\n\nSeit \u201eEternal Darkness\u201c geh\u00f6rt zu Horror \u00e0 la Lovecraft in Spielen auch die Leiste mit geistiger Gesundheit dazu. Zauber schaden dem Verstand ebenso wie traumatische Erfahrungen in Begegnungen und Flucht vor Monstern. Wahnsinnig hat der Spieler nicht nur nette Halluzinationen, sondern muss auch dem Drang widerstehen, sich umzubringen: Entscheidungen werden in kurzen Intervallen durch Selbstmordkommandos ersetzt.

The writing is uncharacteristically flat and straight forward, the art is thoughtfully stylized but Croshaw just doesn't have the skill to make it work as well as it should (why not hire an artist?).\n\nThe next problem is in the small amount of variation possible. FTL, which seems to be this game's main inspiration, provides much more variety and replayability. After 7 hours of play at the time of writing I feel I've got my money's worth, but I don't have any desire to go back to it. I've done less then ten runs, only got one of the major endings, unlocked two of five characters and only a fraction of the exhaustive achievements list, but I know when I replay I'm only going to see the same handful of scenarios I've already seen and the same extremely tiresome and repetitive dungeon design.\n\nThe RNG element is always a problem in these games, but this is worse than most.

An Old One and his m8 are about to enact Dark Souls PvP in real life by invading our planet and realm while another Old One gets salty at them. Are you a bad enough dude to battle unspeakable abominations and save humanity?\n\n[b]GOOD STUFF[/b]\n[list]\n[*][u]Neat investigation system[/u]: A little chart helps you track down various properties of the 3 Old Ones such as their name, colour and rune. Not only can you fill this up by finding notes that give you direct details, but you can also make educated guesses by, for example, observing the various runes you find in \"dungeons\", or even certain enemies. This detective work is much better than some similar examples that have been provided in high profile games, such as in the second game of a very popular RPG series about an old guy that hunts monsters.\n[*][u]Survival[/u]: Your resources, whether they are bullets, drugs or money, are actually quite limited on average. Advancing in a straight line, liberating towns tainted by the Old Ones' corruption and laying the smackdown to the big guy himself and getting back home in time for breakfast is a fantasy. Often you'll have to backtrack or sidetrack, trying to scavenge or buy new resources or equipment even if it's just to increase your odds of survival a little bit. Sometimes you might even be forced to let towns fall to the Shadow, or abandon a quest to save your life. Money can buy you weapons and health, but not sanity. And between unexpected encounters in dungeons or on the road, you may lose more of these than you expected. Planning ahead and not taking chances blindly is an important part of the game.\n[*][u]Horror[/u]: \"Return of the Old Ones\" kind of stories are overdone, yet in games they remain a good blueprint to use provided you can surprise the player from time to time. Thankfully there are some surprises here! Also while the game itself is actually not what I would call scary, it has very nice atmosphere and certain dungeon events manage to instill tension. The creatures encountered in the game are all suitably grotesque in appearance and sound, and there are quite a few of them to encounter over multiple playthroughs. Diary entries for each of them are available, the more you... spend time with them the more text you unlock in the entries. As customary in many Lovecraftian games, sanity loss induces hallucinations, loss of control or an urge to blow one's brains out. The latter is especially amusing as a low-sanity character's menu choices can suddenly turn into \"Kill myself\" and the player will have to stop his character from doing it. Also, the music and sounds are really nice as well.\n[*][u]Randomization and persistence[/u]: Each new game has of course 3 different Old Ones with differing characteristics, but also different cities that are already corrupted or that are safe, as well as different incantations for spells. In every playthrough you will also encounter randomized events while on the road and receive random quests. As stated above there are bestiary entries to fill out, as well as a the 30-something pages of the diary of a certain character to find. There are actually 2 more characters to unlock, and each of these gain levels as you succeed or fail your games. Leveling up enables you to assign a number of 'birth stars' that give you all kinds of bonuses, using charts that also change with each new game. There are a number of different endings to get. Last, there are challenge modes to unlock for each character as well as an infinite dungeon mode. These are add quite a bit of replayability to the game.\n[/list]\n\n[b]OK STUFF[/b]\n[list]\n[*][u]Combat[/u]: The game is played with KBM, and your characters have guns, but you can't aim them. Most of the time the auto-aim mechanics are fine, but sometimes it makes you waste your precious bullets for nothing. Pistol whipping enemies works fine, but perhaps there could be more animations when hitting enemies above or below your waist line.\n[*][u]Sanity gain and loss[/u]: Sanity is very fragile in this game, as it should be. However, it doesn't always get depleted in a logical manner, and recovering it is completely up to chance (unless you want to use DRUGS...) For example even leaving a room where an enemy is present reduces your sanity quite a bit, but doing things like killing a lot of monsters, dispelling magic, saving and helping civilians and the like does nothing to restore it. At least for sanity loss upon escaping there could be a condition such as not losing any sanity if you were in the room for less than 2 seconds. Or recovering a couple points upon successful dungeon completion. As it stands the most reliable way to gain some sanity is clicking the 'kill myself' button and not killing youself.\n[*][u]Art style[/u]: The super-simple graphics work really well for the game, but it's no [i]INFRA ARCANA[/i] (a game you must play if the combination of Lovecraftian horror, true roguelike mechanics and horrible difficulty sounds appealing) when it comes to its presentation.\n[*][u]Inventory[/u]: Your resources are limited in general, but they're a little artificially limited. For example your briefcase can hold tons of items like body armor and gas mask, but not more than one magazine for one bullet type for your pistol, and your car apparently doesn't have enough space for more than one medkit. Maybe a more realistic way of dealing with these could be found.\n[/list]\n\n[b]BAD STUFF[/b]\n[list]\n[*][u]Lore[/u]: Too little lore is uncovered within a session. Even when the identities of the Old Ones are uncovered, nothing substantial about them is known (at best you get some notes talking about spooky children's rhymes or elementals of ancient myths). Somehow making this deeper would have been good.\n[*][u]Binary choices[/u]: Too often random events present you choices that are too simplistic. For example, if you encounter a man that seems to be either possessed or in the throes of an illness, your options are to help him or to wait and see. Now in reality faced with such a situation you can choose the latter option and wait a little while to see if anything changes, but in the game choosing that option will make your character turn stone cold and just stare at the person until he dies (if that's the event you stumbled upon of course). Too often the choices in random events equate simply to coin flips. There is no reason why something like diving into a house on fire to look for a survivor has the same probability of a bad outcome as an event like described above, where you are in control.\n[*][u]Writing[/u]: Writing errors pop up now and then. Ben pls.\n[/list]\n\nAll in all, this is a very neat little horror game. It's fun to play, with progression that feels satisfying and fair difficulty.

I don't always agree with his reviews or his style, but he has cheeky charm and a sense of old-school fun that I've come to enjoy. Mogworld was lovely and rather clever. Zero Punctuation is hilarious and often insightful. This game, however, is disappointing.\n\nTL;DR: There are better roguelikes and better Lovecraftian games for around the same price point. I would struggle to recommend this game even if it were on sale.\n\nThe Consuming Shadow succeeds in two areas: difficulty and a cursory sense of novelistic credibility. I admit, Croshaw definitely pays proper dues to Howard Phillips Lovecraft. I admire his attempt at crafting a \"literary\" roguelike. Yahtzee definitely TRIED to capture the atmosphere of cosmic horror, and he occasionally succeeds with a taut line now and again. On the other hand, despite the \"back-of-the-box\" claim that there are \"countless random encounters,\" there is little variety in the type of random events or in their textual prefacing. As of ~2 hours playtime, I have seen repetition of at least 3 of these random encounters (the hysterical woman on the side of the road, the businessman with a locked car, and the rescue of a person captured by cultists-- hilariously enough, the first time I shot the captive by accident, but the second time I was ready! Thanks, lazy programming!). \n\nLiterary though it may be, it fails to be genuinely interesting. Yes, Ben, you wrote some punchy sentences that, when jammed together according to certain scripts, make discernable paragraphs. None of these \"Mad Libs: Eldritch Edition\" entries are special nor particularly good. After trying very hard to enjoy the writing for some time, I began to skip virtually all of the text. It has made no difference in gameplay.\n\nLook, if you want to make a literary game, make the literature of the game important. I chuckled the first time I read \"I found a black market dealer willing to sell me goods,\" and the fellow was selling hollowpoint ammunition and SKATEBOARD PADS. I know I'm not supposed to take it entirely seriously, but narrative consistency from a published author shouldn't be a tall order.\n\nThe game succeeds in being difficult, although not often for the right reasons. Because of the two-dimensional viewpoint, some overlapping enemies will be completely obscured at the outset of combat. Sanity loss is expressed in hallucinations and control manipulation (left is right and right is left, sometimes your character disappears, etc.) This is fun in an old-school way but is poorly executed and unbalanced. Lost ~20% of your sanity? You may end up accidentally killing yourself when the game starts flashing a suicide option over your medkit button. No, I'm not complaining that this happens, I'm frustrated that this happens with so much sanity remaining. It doesn't make sense. Hit detection is poor, and it is impossible to manually aim. On several occasions, I was staring down two or three foes and found myself unable to aim at the most dangerous, difficult-to-avoid enemy. A simple targeting option? Strangely absent.\n\nThe Consuming Shadow clearly capitalizes on the replay value associated with roguelikes, but unfortunately it doesn't provide enough variety to make it worthwhile. What are you to expect from adding handicaps from the various challenges offered? More of the same. Even as I progressed, gaining more customization options with birthsigns, for instance, (options which give the player various stat bonuses) I never felt as if I were enjoying the game more nor that the options available genuinely added to my experience. It felt lazy, just as many roguelikes feel lazy. It seems that with many indie devs, if you can't write a good story or design a good level, you make a roguelike. \n\nAdditonal notes:\n\n-Achievements are basically broken: I have received achievements for collecting all diary pages (which I haven't), rescuing 20 unbrainwashed humans (haven't done that either) and completing 50 dungeons (definitely have not done that). \n\n-Even if you can hear and partially see an enemy, if you fire from too great a distance, your shot will be wasted. It is still unclear to me why a targeting system is unavailable.\n\n-All of the encounters are either a) fetch quests b) rescue quests or c) kill quests. All of the rooms in the game are roughly the same size, and all of the locations have the same meager handful of elements to work from. Outdoor environments have leafy walls instead of plaster ones, for instance.\n\nI cannot recommend this game despite wanting to love it. I have played many roguelikes, and this is by far the most disappointing. \n\nEdit: I am extremely grateful to Steam for granting my refund in spite of my 2.1 hours of playtime, the latter 20 minutes or so which I accrued by preparing for this review.", "timestamp_created": 1460733893, "timestamp_updated": 1461470898, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": -1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.544249", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22031888": {"recommendationid": "22031888", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970230150", "num_games_owned": 823, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 535, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498720251}, "language": "english", "review": "The Consuming Shadow is an interesting, and I think mostly successful, take on the roguelike, sidescroller and adventure genres. \n\nThe random nature of the mystery gives it replayability, as you can never know which elder god you're facing without knowing most of the clues and taking educated guesses. The exploration and sidescrolling parts of the game are very simple, though, and I can see it becoming monotonous since you're always facing the same enemies with the same abilities in environments with very little to distinguish between them. Some variety would improve the game, as every room looks pretty much the same as every other room and every highway looks the same as another highway.

When you're low on health and running away from a hunter, when you've got two minutes on the clock, are in stonehenge and have only half a banishment ritual, etc.\nOne extremely minor quibble I have (disregarding the first one) is that you can't just skip the astrology section once you've got birth stars. You HAVE to look for an empty space and choose it if you don't want any bonuses ruining your playthrough.\nIf I might suggest extra features, perhaps a hard mode where each astrology bonus comes with a penalty as well, or something - like, if you want +25 health, you have to take -25 sanity, or raising your medkit capacity means lowering your ammo-count, or something randomized.\n\nIf you want the game insultingly easy, and you've got some birth stars to spare, GET EXTRA AMMUNITION. Health and sanity are all well and good, but if you've got a tonne of ammo, you won't need to take hits to health or sanity at all. Once you maximize ammo capacity, you really only have to worry about your route and the clues - the game's extremely liberal with handing out ammo. \nAlternatively, increase Melee and keep ammo for bosses.

Bit difficult to fully describe, to be honest, as there's a clash of game types going on here, but we have two major gameplay elements going through. Well, three technically, but there's some intermingling.\n\nFirstly, you begin the game as one of the four playable characters (the other three being unlocked over the course of playtime and challenges) with the goal of stopping a nebulous, eldritch god from invading the world and unleashing unspeakable horrors upon the people. To do this, you have your car and notebook; the first used (rather obviously) to drive around the English countryside, hitting town after town, with the intent of gathering information. Any information you find is added to your notebook, for you to peruse at your pleasure and have your own little wall of crazy to find out who the invading god is so you can adequately fight them.\n\nThe usual way you find clues and information is through the second game mode, which are a Dungeon-like environment. In these Dungeons, you'll fight against enemies spawned by the invading god, monsters and twisted horrors normally, though average folk make their appearances. The combat mechanics are extremely simple: A gun for ranged combat with three ammo types (Standard 9mm, Hollowpoint, Armour Piercing), the ability to pistol whip, and the ability to cast spells for various effects.\n\nStats in the game are also extremely simple: you get Health and Sanity, both obvious in and of themselves, although Sanity is a subtle nuisance that slowly grows bothersome throughout the game. Health is reduced by taking damage, while Sanity is reduced slightly by being damaged by monsters, by encountering terrifying or disturbing events, or by casting spells of the shadow. Effects of low sanity range from illusory monsters to dungeon doors and areas shifting, quite varied. The most dangerous mechanic, however, is in the overworld, where when you have an event or choice to make (such as in towns or when someone flags down your car), the choices may occasionally start shaking and change to \"Kill Myself\". Yes there's a suicide minigame, and if you fail it you die. Really encourages you to be paranoid and careful, which is what you would be when fighting eldritch horrors from another dimension.\n\nThe game's simplicity allows it to become complex through multiple playthroughs. The clues pile up after a while, and sorting through six pages of the blasted things, some of which are telling you the same information differently, becomes a logic puzzle on its own. So we know that Gnix is NOT the invading god, and the purple god hates the god of Fear, and the god of lust is identified by the EU rune, while the red god is the god of fear, that means Gnix is the purple god-wait, no, because the god identified by the EU rune is a friend of Gnix, or...\n\nIt gets confusing. And I like that.\n\nThe entire theme the game's going for is \"Darkness there and nothing more.\" You're fighting against something that, even when you see it, is nebulous and strange and unusual, and you can't quite put your finger on what it is, you just know it's wrong. It's a well made game, with an average play time of 20-30 minutes per run, and rather enjoyable.

I haven't even unlocked the last character yet, and I'm not even close to ending the game properly with all the other characters. The game has a lot of content, you see. I've been a fan of Yahtzee's for a while now, enjoying his earlier works, as well as the various series he does on youtube these days, so it comes as little surprise to me that he hits it out of the ball park with this one. The randomly generated nature of the game makes it different every time, and I've only ever once ran into an error with two assets not going together well and forcing me to restart the game. The writing, and  the themes of Lovecraftian cosmic horror in this game is pulled off fantastically.\nThe overarching puzzle mechanic of the game in which you must deduce who the invading god is is a fun little brain teaser. Nothing too brutal if you know what you're doing, but it can take you a bit at first.\nDon't get me wrong though, the game is brutal. Very much so. Each and every dungeon that must be explored to complete the game holds creatures spawned from the ancients. Rusted metal and deformed flesh is waiting inside to break your bones and.. make you go to a hospital. Speaking of that, the enconomy must be pretty damn good over there in the UK if you can get a set of body armor for a mere 20 pounds.\nThe dungeon sections are all enjoyable, and like I said, get pretty damn hard. But the combat is never something you can't win without practice. The dungeons are mostly exploration based anyway, and it's done well. The art style itself is, well, very reminscent of flash games, but the animation is enough to make up for it, I feel.\nPlay as Trilby, Gabe, or any of these other two random assholes and try to banish not-Czho-mythos-Chzo before he CONSUMES the world into his SHADOW.\nIf you like FTL, or you like Lovecraftian horror, definitely definitely definitely pick this one up.

It's by Yahtzee and, as it's obvious through the text of the game, this is what he was doing instead of writing a third novel. COME ON WRITE ANOTHER!!!! Anyway, the game:\n\nPROS:\n+The game is set in Britian and you're supposed to go from town to town finding information relating to which of the three dark gods. One of them is invading and you, as the player, gotta figure it out. This alone is the primary reason why you'll buy the game because, as I discovered in my exprience, I really found myself hunting for information and second guessing my findings until I was certain which god was invading. Mix this with the time limit and frailty of the character, and it becomes a glorious thing.\n+When you die, you die. Actions have consequences and you will probably bleed out while driving to your next location.\n+The time limit really adds to the tension of the game. Whenever that BUM sound happens and the big 55 hours left on the screen hits, I feel the great lovecraftian horror slowly manifesting in our world.\n+The art style is minimum but works really well.\n+Sound and music are perfect, both adding to the atmosphere.\n+The other three characters which can be unlocked play differently than the first enough to justify them.\n+When successfully banish the correct god, you really, really, REALLY feel like you've won.\n\nMIXED:\n+/- The learning curve and constantly dying when you start the game (or start a new character) can be grueling. The \"Birth Stars\" really help later play throughs, but you only get them after dying.\n+/- Unlocking the other characters ranges from beating the game with a good ending to randomly doing a task that an online guide has to tell you about.\n+/- The cell phone messages are perfect with ONE minor problem: If you're using a controller, which I recommend since mouse aiming isn't neccessar, be careful pressing A. Sometimes you'll decline a message when, in reality, you wanted to read it. Just warning you.\n+/- While some inventory items are really useful, others are useless to the player. There's only one use for items outside of the dungeons and that's the random encounters on the road. See below.\n\n\nCONS:\n-Many of the random encounters found on the road are a literally coin toss regardless of what action you choose if they are negative or not. Many of them have a \"Run\" or \"Do something\" with \"Do Something\" risking a 50/50 chance of bad. Unless you have the correct invetory item, I'd almsot recommend ignoring all of them. I feel like the investigation portion of the game is lost on these, like there should be certain words or descriptions that would signel \"Run\" rather than stay.\n-One of the updates reset some of my achievement progress.

I can hear the gap in the ambient audio loop when you visit an inflicted town, and the rain cuts out when you walk inside a house; in short, the sound design is basic, and - for the most part - is unnatural sounding. There are many minor details, apparently overlooked in development, which can take one out of the experience.\n\nDespite this, The Consuming Shadow is still largely a very immersive game. Very few games capture the heavy atmosphere of dread that is essential to survival horror, and this is something that the game does well. It is a genuinely tense and unnerving experience, with the pressure of time constantly weighing down on you as you evade enemies via the extremely clunky control scheme, exploring dungeons looking for clues so that you may potentially save the world. The puzzle system is very well designed, allowing you to hazard a guess at who the invader might be, in case you lack some information as the time runs out. It expects you to think for yourself from the information gathered, rather than simply gather clues and expect the answer to be handed to you once you've collected enough, which is rare and worth praising.\n\nPerhaps the strongest aspect of the game is the writing, and how the game treats writing as integral to the experience. It does lean somewhat towards the telling rather than showing, but the writing is solid nonetheless. Every piece of dialogue, monologue, fluff text, or any descriptions of any kind add to the overall atmosphere, and are more than barebones exposition.\n\nSo I would recommend this game; for the price it's worth checking out.

It's difficult for me to describe how awful this game is.\n\nFirst of all -- the game has nothing whatsoever that could be compared with H.P. Lovecraft's work.  Reviewers who keep using this in their reviews should actually read Lovecraft's work to see how truly psychological his horror was.  There's nothing psychological or suspensful about anything in this game.  Period.\n\nNext, the combat mechanics are questionable and dated -- click click click, bang bang bang.  Oh, wait a minute, the interface forgot to tell you you don't have ammo.  Sorry about that.\n\nUsually, when I feel the need to comment on a game, I try to play it for at least two hours.  This game p*sses me off so much I can't stand wasting the precious moments of my life to get to two hours.  Would a tutorial help?  Yes.  Would it make me give a positive review of this game?  No way in hell.\n\nIt's hard to believe that a developer has such little respect for consumers as to make a pointless, thrill-less, meaningfull-less game that makes you question your own sanity for buying it.  An example:  a headless body hops towards you and you click randomly at it.  There is no actual aiming, because it's a flash game -- your character (seen in blackened profile) fires at the headless body (seen in blackened profile) can either point at a 90 degree angle or not at all.  So there it is, the headless body is kicking the crap out of you and so you duck into a side room.  You're notified that running away from monsters reduces your sanity.  Why?\n\nSuffice it to say that I question my own sanity for putting in .3 hours of my life into this game!\n\nThe more I play games on steam that claim they are \"Lovercraftian\" or \"atmospheric horror\", the more I begin to believe that the developer was lazy and didn't want to invest time in the graphics, or did not know how.\n\nAs a casual gamer who counts the moments of my life preciously -- family, career, responsibilties, the need to escape from frustration -- this game served only to make me feel stupid for spending $5.  That's a lot of money to me, believe it or not -- I have four kids and a grandkid that, like many of us, works hard to support.  If I had spent $10 I most likely would have written a formal apology to my wife for spending that much of my Christmas money on this crap.\n\nPlease, for God's sake, don't waste your money of this game.

are on the surface very poor in quality, I do not feel the improvement of the graphics could anyway actually improve the quality of the game and in fact the graphics style in many cases adds a sort of ambiguity to the creatures and environments that increases the scare factor.\n\nThis game is heavily entrenched in lovecraftian lore and like many of the most famous lovecraftian games, features a sort of detective element as the user (who plays as one of four characters with varying abilities for slightly different playstyles) must discover clues as to what the banishment ritual is to stop the invading god and who the invading god actually is.\n\nIt is this detective element that is one of my favourite parts of the game as using all the clues to work out the three gods and their varing details makes for its own subgame that keeps you going throughout.\n\nThe main gameplay is the dungeons which you are in so often that you would not be initially forgiven for thinking these would get repetetive but the constant threat of death or insanity, using the gameplay shifting and excellently implemented insanity mechanic, keeps the stakes up and stops any dungeon sequence from being boring.\n\nAs previously mentioned there is an insanity mechanic and unlike in other games where the changes are superficial and tend to encourage insanity accidently due to the interesting changes in this game you fear insanity and being insane actually really increases the difficulty forcing you to put insanity as a priority over health as health can be more easily recovered.\n\nLastly you will die in this game and as the game will tell you death is neccesary to get progression through the birthstar system to give you bonuses and as the story follows the multiverse theory all playthroughs are canon and there are even hints to the creators own Chzo mythos.\n\nOverall I must give it an 8/10 as for all the good things stated above there is a genuine problem of balance as the game is cruel and there are a few times that I looked at the game and got frustrated at the detective elements but they are almost always the fualt of the player but there are a few things that the creator could improve like the in car UI and better graphics would certainly appease some of the knats if not improve the game.", "timestamp_created": 1451532514, "timestamp_updated": 1451532514, "voted_up": true,

This is Gamer Guy (In a Suit) from the Echo Army YouTube channel! Today I am bringing you a review of the Indie Adventure game The Consuming Shadow. The Consuming Shadow has been around for a while now, but was finally released onto Steam on November 20, 2015 by Developer/Publisher Ben \"Yahtzee\" Croshaw.\n\n(NOTE: This game was NOT reviewed using a key provided by the Developer and/or Publisher, it was a game I purchased for my own account)\n\n\nVideo Review: \n\n(NO video...Shadowplay would not record this...I'm kinda scared!)\n\nThe \"Too Long, Didn't Watch\" Review:\n\nLovecraftian Rogue-Like is as good as that sounds. Low-quality visuals, high-quality gameplay.\n4/5 and easily worth $10\n\nThe \"Meat & Potatoes\" Review:\n\nThe Consuming Shadow is a great Lovecraftian experience, gamers. This is good stuff here, if this is your kind of thing. Consider a blend between parts of Skyhill, FTL and the TV Show \"Supernatural\". That's essentially what you get here. You get texts and drive around in your car from town to town investigating events and essentially leveling (re: grinding) while finding the runes you need to succesfully cast a banishment ritual at Stonehenge to end all the evil chicanery. Good? Good. There are unlockable characters, different dungeon types, different missions, spells to learn, etc. The \"Insanity Edition\" on Steam adds some awesome play modes to increase replayability. There is an infinite dungeon mode known as \"The Descent\" and there are also Daily Challenges. This is going to be big with fans of Survival Horror, Rogue-Like Perma-Death Gameplay and especially Lovecraftian themes. The stories and events are fairly well done. The visuals are not the most modern and crisp, but aren't exactly what you are here for. To me, this is one of the only true cons. Also, if you do not like to read a bit or don't enjoy horror elements, maybe look elsewhere. All in all, a fantastic little Lovecraftian experience for me.  A solid 4/5 and hours can be lost to this little gem.

Now, if you\u2019re an avid Steam user, you\u2019d know how many dungeon crawler rough-likes there are on the market. They\u2019re worth a dime a dozen at this point. So, I was more than pleased when I found this little gem. It's amazing how unique and promising this game is opposed to the other.\n\nPlot: A strange and horrific shadow is washing over Great Britain in full force. Cities have been ravished by otherworldly beasts, people have been melded into twisted shells of their previous selves, and in just three days, the country will fall\u2026 then the world. All mighty gods known as The Ancients are behind this mayhem, but it\u2019s the player\u2019s job to find out who\u2019s to blame and banish them. You will travel from city to city, all across the UK in search of clues, answers, and knowledge. \n\nAs I mentioned before, The Consuming shadow really is its own game, and I doubt you can mistake it for another. Gameplay is rather straight forward, but it works great. You\u2019ve got a plethora of items to find and collect, multiple ammo types, spells to master and more. Dungeons are grid based, and each one has its own objective. This may vary from securing an occult text, finding a missing person, destroying monster nests etc. And let me tell you, this game can be tough, and you will die. Monsters deal vicious damage and conserving ammo is not as easy as you might think. Driving also plays a big role in The Consuming Shadow. Driving from location to location takes time, so it\u2019s important to set a predetermined path as to save every precious hour. But there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ll bump into random events along the way. You\u2019re usually given two choices to make, and more often than not, my decisions resulted in negative outcomes, like the loss of some health or sanity. There isn\u2019t any pattern behind these events and making the right choice is based purely on luck.\n\nThere\u2019s also a sanity meter that must be kept healthy. The madder you become, the more difficult the game is. But, unlike most games in the genera, dying isn\u2019t a total lost. XP is still earned and built up through multiple playthroughs, and each time a player levels up, they\u2019re given an array of buffs before they start their next run. \n\nNow, this is where a complaint of mine comes in. The max level is ten, and if you were to spend all ten of your buffs on health and sanity increases, it makes the game a bit underwhelming. If I\u2019m sporting 456 health, it\u2019s gonna take A LOT to kill me. It also makes your first bunch of playthroughs damn-near impossible, seeing as how you start off with such low stats.\n\nBut apart from that\u2026 there really isn\u2019t much to complain about, here. The Consuming Shadows accomplishes what it aims to do with flying stars, and apart from a couple gripes, I\u2019d say it\u2019s definitely worth your money.", "timestamp_created": 1449332418, "timestamp_updated": 1449337404, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502175", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19446663": {"recommendationid": "19446663", "author": {"steamid": "76561198179979129", "num_games_owned": 44, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1115, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1465571731}, "language": "swedish", "review": "I love this game!

The game is amazingly replayable with the independant character leveling, and challenges. Unlocking the characters is something that is really quite intersting, you have to throw the curent game. Maybe throw is an exagetation, but the game certanliy dosent hand you the unlockable ones.

An ancient god plans to invade the world, so you have to find parts of an ancient banishment ritual to stop them. Delve deep into infested monster dens, take drugs, do whatever you need to in order to save the world.\n\nOr die trying. That will happen a lot.\n\nPros:\n-Many aspects of the game are randomized every time. While you may explore similar locales, there's enough to spice things up every time.\n-Real survival horror gameplay. The enemies and atmosphere are oppresive and stressful, but trying to keep your health and supplies up to combat it can be equally stressful. Difficult but rewarding!\n-Unlockable characters, challenge modes, beastiary, this game is a Completionist's dream.\n-Despite the game's randomization, there aren't any truly \"overpowered\" item combinations. You'll be clawing your way through this game no matter what!\n\nCons:\n-Like many other rougelike games, you can get some really bad RNG. Be it a map full of monster-infested towns when you desperately need supplies, unfortunate monster spawns, or random events that conspire against your current run. be ready for lots of stress.\n-Graphics are simplistic by design. Think of something like Undertale: Not hyper-detailed, but it gets the job done. While I personally don't find this a dealbreaker, I can understand why it might be for others.\n-Another \"mixed bag\" criticism is the game's levelling system. As you complete (or fail) runs, you gain experience, unlocking new perks that can improve future playthroughs. While this is very encouraging, it makes early runs feel like you have an unfair disadvantage.\n\nConclusion:\nA great rougelike game that keeps you on the edge of your seat every time you play it. It's not slow-paced like FTL, but it's not as twitchy and fast as Spelunky; it finds a happy middle-ground of slow, methodical gameplay, along with plenty of monster fighting. This game can be very stressful, but I find it very rewarding.", "timestamp_created": 1448268766, "timestamp_updated": 1448268766, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.575718", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19222117": {"recommendationid": "19222117", "author": {"steamid": "76561198111597298", "num_games_owned": 147, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2284, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501514027}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game and its creator.", "timestamp_created": 1448221752, "timestamp_updated": 1511429613, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497280", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19214410": {"recommendationid": "19214410", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971230354", "num_games_owned": 470, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 87, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1448196242}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u6bce\u56de\u5192\u967a\u306e\u5185\u5bb9\u304c\u5909\u308f\u308b\u3001\u30e9\u30f3\u30c0\u30e0\u751f\u6210\u306e\u6a2a\u30b9\u30af\u30ed\u30fc\u30eb\u30a2\u30c9\u30d9\u30f3\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3002\n\u30b8\u30e3\u30f3\u30eb\u306f\u30b5\u30a4\u30b3\u30ed\u30b8\u30ab\u30eb\u30db\u30e9\u30fc\uff0b\u30b3\u30ba\u30df\u30c3\u30af\u30db\u30e9\u30fc\u3002\n\n\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30f3\u30d8\u30f3\u30b8\u304b\u3089\u8868\u306e\u4e16\u754c\u306b\u4fb5\u5165\u3057\u3088\u3046\u3068\u3059\u308b\u53e4\u306e\u795e\u3092\u6b62\u3081\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306b\u300160\u6642\u9593\uff08\u30ad\u30e3\u30e9\u306b\u3088\u3063\u3066\u306f24\u6642\u9593\uff09\u306e\u9593\u306b\u30a4\u30ae\u30ea\u30b9\u306e\u7530\u820e\u3092\u3092\u65c5\u3057\u3066\u53e4\u306e\u795e\u306b\u5bfe\u6297\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u8a60\u5531\uff08\u30eb\u30fc\u30f34\u3064\uff09\u3092\u898b\u3064\u3051\u51fa\u3057\u3001\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30f3\u30d8\u30f3\u30b8\u306e\u6700\u6df1\u90e8\u3067\u5531\u3048\u308b\u306e\u304c\u6700\u7d42\u76ee\u7684\u3002\n\n\u6642\u9593\u7d4c\u904e\u3068\u5171\u306b\u5e83\u304c\u308b\u72c2\u6c17\u3068\u95c7\u3001\u6e1b\u3063\u3066\u3086\u304f\u56de\u5fa9\u30a2\u30a4\u30c6\u30e0\u3068\u5f3e\u85ac\u30010\u306b\u306a\u308bSAN\u5024\u2026\u3000\u8eab\u4f53\u30fb\u7cbe\u795e\u5171\u306b\u5065\u5168\u306a\u307e\u307e\u53e4\u306e\u795e\u306b\u5bfe\u6297\u3067\u304d\u308b\u304b\u306f\u3001\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u6b21\u7b2c\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1448197545, "timestamp_updated": 1448197545, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507021", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19210197": {"recommendationid": "19210197", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003106938", "num_games_owned": 139, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 370, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1456294326}, "language": "english", "review": "I just wanted to go into space/10", "timestamp_created": 1448180246, "timestamp_updated": 1448180246, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 67, "votes_funny": 173, "weighted_vote_score": "0.524774", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19207273": {"recommendationid": "19207273", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086586626", "num_games_owned": 292, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 1411, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1473104404}, "language": "english", "review": "Where is my mind? ~~\u266a", "timestamp_created": 1448164482, "timestamp_updated": 1448164482, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476515", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19203439": {"recommendationid": "19203439", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026782701", "num_games_owned": 527, "num_reviews": 89, "playtime_forever": 47, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1448145775}, "language": "english", "review": "At its core, this game is very simple. A Lovecraftian procedurally generated CYOA with action sequences, simple shadowy graphics and a horrific plot.\n\nBut that simplicity in and of itself is what makes it so good. What it does, it does well. \n\nYou are the standard Lovecraftian \"scholar of the occult turned bastion against the darkness, sacrificing your very self and mind to save the world from the mind tearing evil beyond\". \n\nIn the main game mode you have 60 \"hours\" to find the keys to complete the banishment ritual to stop the dark god from entering the world through Stonehenge and warping all creation. To do this, you travel around the UK in your car, stopping at various towns. Some are peaceful and untainted, while others have been infested with the Shadow. In those you may investigate where the infection is and shut it down. Random text messages arrive, both people providing advice and cheering you on, and the Dark Forces taunting you (Cthulu has taught its minions to use SMS, I see...). Theres also random events as you travel around, sometimes leading to more investigation sequences.\n\nAll this comes at the cost of your own life and sanity, of course. In the action sequences the game turns into a 2d room by room maze, randomly generated. Search the rooms to find clues to which dark god is trying to get through stonehenge, and items and magic spells to help you in you journeys. Shoot horrid shadow monsters with your trusty gun, or just pistol whip the hell out of them, as you dont have many bullets. After completeting whatever it was that sent you there, sometimes you got to RUN as the dark forces dont like being thwarted. Fortunately theres a handy minimap in the corner that shows where youve been.\n\nOnce you have gathered enough clues to piece together which dark god is trying to f'up the earth, get to stonehenge and cast the banishment ritual (magic is used by quickly selecting symbols with RS) to keep it out. \n\nKind of like a game of Clue, only with much more insanity, Ia Ia Cthulu fhtagn-ing, and terror.\n\nThe sanity meter is cool. As you start going insane, weird things start happening on screen. Doors move, things vanish, all hell breaks loose (literally). And in the CYoA text segments, the words in the selection boxes start flicking back and forth between what you are trying to do (ie \"Investigate Further\", \"Return to Car\") and \"KILL YOURSELF\". You can imagine the end result of that one.\n\nThe writing in the CYoA segments is *awesome* and totally captures that Lovecraftian feel of flickers at the edge of vision, all consuming darkness, and incredible wrongness, and you are the only one who can stop it, although youd rather just curl up in a corner and die. Graphics are simple, but this game is proof positive you dont need ultra detailed gore to be creepy. In the action sequences you and the monsters are just shadows against a backdrop (rendered appropriately for the area graveyard/park, house, abandoned building etc).\n\nIt also has persistant unlocables to aid you in your quests. Extra abilities, items, diary entries, game modes and more unlockable characters provide a feeling of completion, even after watching the last nameless scholar slowly bring his gun to his head to end the madness within for the 10th time.\n\nMy only compaint is the XBox controller isnt perfect. Ive had issues getting it to register what I'm doing, randomly shutting off and so forth. Playing keyboard isnt an option for me because of physical issues, so I cant say if the k+M setup has the same control issues. But they are minor issues.\n\nLovecraft fans will love this one.

Yes\nIs it worth 10 bucks? Ehhhhhhh... That'll be up to you, of course.\n\nIt's a very well written and designed game. Not scary, nor particularly distrubing, but it is very very creepy. The art direction, although very simple, is also perfectly fitting. Even the text assets are acceptable despite being default plaintext, seeing as the character is either typing it out or reading it on typed paper.\n\nThe gameplay is uniqe, as far as I know. You simply walk left and right through procedurally generated dungeons and events, shooting, bashing, looting, running, and incanting your way past your foes. You have both health and sanity to monitor, of course. What makes it fun is whodunit take on figuring out which evil entity to banish, piece by piece assembling the know how to save the world. The fittingly abiguious yet descriptive writting also helps. Yes I know that's oxymoronic, but it just works. \n\nThe challenge is tight. At first I was sceptical of the difficulty. Then I realized you drain your health kit like a bullet hole riddled tub drains water. Then I couldn't find a way to permenantly restore sanity. Then I had broken legs, a panic attack, an was gushing blood, and proceded to clear three more towns that way before dying. Shit was tense.\n\nReplayability also seems very high, which is good for a session based game like this. If you've played FTL, you'd probably find Consuming Shadow's game sessions similar in length. Besides the main gameplay supported story and unlocks, you also have a daily challenge generator, and an endless dungeon mode. The list of individual challenges you can also unlock is short, but the game makes up for it in other unlockables. It has a diary you can rebuild, page by page. It also has a typical 'bestiary', but one that unlocks word by word, creating a more rewarding 'bestiary' to fill than most every other game has.\n\nIn conclusion, sure, the game has problems. The obvious \"how did they miss that\" graphical bug, the graphics that obviously auto-scale for bigger monitors, and keys can't be rebound in the options. These little problems pale in comparison to everything it does right.

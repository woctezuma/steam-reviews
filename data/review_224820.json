The truth is, you grow accustomed to it rather quickly, so I would say, dont be so discouraged by this factor.\nOn the negatives side, the only thing I can think of is that maybe it will bore some people after a while, as, despite the random generation, the levels are pretty similar each time. That being said, if you play it casually once in a while, I think this will not be a problem.\nOh, I should also say that the difficulty is a bit elevated, but I only mention it so you don't gather the impression that it is in the casual difficulty level. I don't believe it is extremely difficult, at least not in the NINJA difficulty, which I haven't tried.\n\nI am not sure if I would recommend buying it at full price, but I would definately recommend buying it on sale.

Controlando o \"crimson ninja\",  pulando, matando os monstros e descendo os n\u00edveis da grande torre. Eu diria que \u00e9 uma mistura entre Ninja Gaiden (os ataques, shurikens, \"magics\") com Downwell (o sistema de andares).\nO Game \u00e9 bem simples, 3 \u00e0 4 n\u00edveis na torre, uma arma prim\u00e1ria e uma secund\u00e1ria que podem ser selecionadas ap\u00f3s ter completado tal desafio do jogo, temos uma arma terci\u00e1ria e uma \"magic\". O que eu mais gostei do game \u00e9 que ele conseguiu captar esta velocidade e adrenalina que Super Crate Box, Ninja Gaiden e Hotline Miami fariam.

An absolutely dazzling Ninja Gaiden/Castlevania/ROGUE-LIKE game. One of the best games I\u2019ve ever played, and I recommend it to anyone looking for the feel of classic 1980s action games.\n\nThis a 16-bit style 1980s style action game.  This game basically is reminiscent of NES games such as Castlevania (1986) and Ninja Gaiden (1989).  The level design is interesting in that you begin at the top of a tower and you are trying to make your way to the bottom.  During playthroughs you can earn different weapons (i.e., whips, flame throwers, baseball bats, etc.) and power ups (i.e., slow downs).  You equip these different weapons before starting the game.  You have a host of offensive weapons, including your main weapon, throwing weapons, and bombs.  There are also spells.  The games play is similar to the classic games already mentioned.  However, these is a timer, and you have to keep a pretty speedy pace as you through the game.  There are time extension pickups, but you never get to just slow down.  This makes the game unbelievably fast paced.  The game has a lot of replay value because of custom maps, randomly generated content, and the speed of the game.

Pone a prueba tus reflejos.\n- Spelunky: por los escenarios aleatorios, llenos de trampas. Algunas veces tendr\u00e1s que usar bombas para destrozar cosas, esquivar trampas, etc\n\nTodo esto \"enmascarado\" en un videojuego al m\u00e1s puro estilo de los cl\u00e1sicos Ninja Gaiden.\n\nPero a la vez, no merece ser comparado, lo veo muy \u00fanico. Realmente me ha recordado a todas esas cosas buenas de los juegos que he citado. Y son juegos bastantes chachi pistachi todos ellos.\n\nY por si fuera poco, todo ello realizado con un mimo, un detalle que sorprende; las animaciones, la variedad y originalidad de enemigos, armas, objetos... hasta te viene un comic! (de un dibujo bastante bueno, en mi opini\u00f3n). Si bien es cierto que es como una introducci\u00f3n solo, de unas 5 p\u00e1ginas.. \u00bfc\u00faantos juegos te vienen con un comic?\nAdem\u00e1s cuenta con un editor de mapas.\nHasta la pantalla de estadisticas est\u00e1 hecha con mimo.\n\nAh bueno, y un estilo de dibujo que me encanta, y que las capturas de steam, tan peque\u00f1as, no le hacen justicia.\n\nPuedo estar hablando de muchas m\u00e1s cosas buenas de \u00e9l, pero es que me voy a jugar de nuevo.\n\nAsi que, en conclusi\u00f3n, si quieres un juego super entretenido, que te ponga a prueba y te gustan las croquetas, este es

When you come back after a hard day at work/school and just want to wind down and cut some dudes. SHODN is a perfect example of how a pixelated indie game can become one of the most addictive games out there. \n\nThis game has everything to appeal to everyone: whether you're a casual or hardcore gamer, you'll find yourself addicted to this game. If you like pixel art, then fear not, this game's art style is very pleasing. Couple that with its music and you've got yourself a pretty amazing scenario. The game in itself isn't too terribly hard to learn; a couple of hours at worst to learn how to navigate efficiently, and a couple more to recognize boss patterns aswell as enemies'. However, this is more than compensated for by the pace of the game. The \"Rage\" mechanic provides a good way for players to descend the tower faster, as do the wide array of weapons to choose from. Which brings me to my second point: Weapon balance. Surprisingly, no weapon in this game feels overpowered when compared to the others. Sure, some are more useful in most situations than others, but overall, you can pick the weapon that best suits your playstyle and make it work. The tower's randomly generated floors also go very well with each other. There are no floors who disrupt the flow of the game or feel out of place. The slower floors actually feel like a breath of fresh air instead of just something to ruin your run. However the randomness has its limits: very early on, you'll start recognizing floor patterns and know how to breeze through them in a matter of seconds. While some might argue this is a good thing for a fast-paced game, I can't help but want more out of this title. I love the game, but after playing a bunch I found myself knowing the entirety of the games' floors, and I just lost the amazement that was discovering something you've never encoutered before standing in your way. But maybe that's just me being too picky.\n\nTL;DR : Is this a good game? Yeah it's a good game. Should you buy it? That all depends on whether you enjoy the fast pace of these types of games.

The game is hard and fast paced, so in order to master SHODN the player will get through a tough and unforgiving road.\n\nYou start at the top of a mysterious and evil tower, full of traps and demons ready to stab the sh\u2665\ufe0ft out of you. From there, you have to descend leaving a trace of murder and destruction, and always paying attention to the time. On you way to the bottom of the tower, you'll find lots of different upgrades, items and secrets which will help you progress through the game, as you die again and again. Let me make this clear: You will die A LOT, over and over. If you're not into hard games that force you to go through the game all over again when you die, then think well before getting SHODN.\n\nThe game features over 10 different melee, ranged and explosive weapons, 4 different magic spells, 16 upgrades, 24 unlockable item drops, 20 different unlockable costumes, and also a level designing tool. It has three difficulties: Normal and Hard(Vanilla), and Ninja(DLC). The DLC includes 3 new weapons mainly focused on speedrunning, the Ninja difficulty, the One-Armed Ninja character and two new gamemodes.\n\nSHODN plays really good and smooth, and makes me feel like a real ninja as i press the keys on my laptop to descend through the tower. The game is really fast, and intended to be played fast. You're rewarded for killing enemies consecutively, and have a limited amount of time until an invincible monster spawns to kill you, unless you get a time bonus or get hit before that. The weapons are all fun to use, the enemies are satisfying to kill, and the bosses very balanced. The soundtrack can start to be a bit annoying as you play the game and, eventually, I started playing it with the sound turned off. \n\nGenerally speaking, despite some rare random crashes, I'm having lots of fun with this game. Got the DLC after playing 20 hours of it, and now I'm completely addicted to the speedrun mode. For a cheap game, Super House of Dead Ninjas exceeds in its quality. If you love difficult and retro games, just go for it. \n\n[h1]Dankness Score: [b]9,0[/b] out of 10[/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1479055486, "timestamp_updated": 1479055486, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26489174": {"recommendationid": "26489174", "author": {"steamid": "76561198255580860", "num_games_owned": 41, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 367, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 56, "last_played": 1514150491}, "language": "english", "review": "Super Cool Game About Ninjas", "timestamp_created": 1478613513, "timestamp_updated": 1478613550, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26479318": {"recommendationid": "26479318", "author": {"steamid": "76561197979942877", "num_games_owned": 255, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 383, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482883362}, "language": "english", "review": "entertaining, fast, fun: 10/10 :)", "timestamp_created": 1478550968, "timestamp_updated": 1478550968, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26458167": {"recommendationid": "26458167", "author": {"steamid": "76561197985073430", "num_games_owned": 732, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 1369, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509070842}, "language": "english", "review": "3 years later and still my favourite arcade-style game.", "timestamp_created": 1478445000, "timestamp_updated": 1478445000, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26014673": {"recommendationid": "26014673", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058548124", "num_games_owned": 623, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 120, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475685310}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\uff75\uff75\uff73\u3000\u30cb\u30f3\u30b8\u30e3\u30a1\u30fb\u30fb\u3000\u30cb\u30f3\u30b8\u30e3\u30a1\u30af\u30a6\u30a5\u30eb\n\n\uff8b\uff96\uff69\u3000\u30cf\u30a4\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30c9\u30ce\u30fc\u30b9\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7\u30cb\u30f3\u30b8\u30e3\u30a1\n\n\uff9c\uff67\uff75\u3000\uff73\uff6a\uff8e\uff9f\uff9d\u30de\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\uff86\uff9d\uff7c\uff9e\uff6c\uff67\n\n\uff71\uff67\uff75\u3000\uff8d\uff9e\uff98\uff70\uff8a\uff70\uff84\uff9e\uff86\uff9d\uff7c\uff9e\uff6c\uff67\n\n\n\u3053\u308c\u5fcd\u3093\u3067\u306a\u3044\u304b\u3089\u30cb\u30f3\u30b8\u30e3\u3067\u306f\u306a\uff08\uff52\uff59", "timestamp_created": 1476375024, "timestamp_updated": 1476375024, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501935", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25953605": {"recommendationid": "25953605", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068670303", "num_games_owned": 437, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 545, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498346252}, "language": "french", "review": "Un rogue-like / beat'em up addictif avec \u00e9norm\u00e9ment de contenu \u00e0 d\u00e9bloquer, un must-have si vous aimez l'esth\u00e9tique r\u00e9tro, la violence gratuite et la difficult\u00e9 bien dos\u00e9e.", "timestamp_created": 1476039050, "timestamp_updated": 1476039050, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25898963": {"recommendationid": "25898963", "author": {"steamid": "76561198111017763", "num_games_owned": 140, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 36, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512872418}, "language": "english", "review": "A+-+", "timestamp_created": 1475826616, "timestamp_updated": 1475826616, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497257", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25816482": {"recommendationid": "25816482", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967685936", "num_games_owned": 1745, "num_reviews": 579, "playtime_forever": 525, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1450426827}, "language": "english", "review": "Cannot recommend this game.

There's only one way to describe it, and others before me have done it: slippery. This kind of fast-paced platformer might appeal to some people, but I just find it terrible. You never feel in control, you just mindlessly cut all ennemies, and you go from a floor to the other hoping for something new. The bosses are the only glimpse of hope, but they're not even THAT exciting, and they only last so long.\n\nI even forget the levels are procedurally generated, because they all look the same (or at least, you have so little time to appreciate them that they might as well just all be the same). \n\nWhen we think rogue-like, or roguelite, or roguelike-like (or whatever we call them now), we think endless hours of playing runs after runs. With SHoDN, I'm bored long before I finish my first run. I have to force myself to wait until I have no more lives to close the game. \n\nI usually enjoy rogue-likes and platformers a lot. I love games where there's so much going on on the screen that you can hardly tell what you're doing, like Bayonetta or Guitar Hero on expert difficulty. I love games with some sort of time trial, and thought it was a clever mechanic to ask players to get to the next \"time power-up\" before they run out of time, which reminded me of arcade games, especially racing games.

It's based on a flash game and from Adult Swim. Those aren't exactly the things I hope to see when looking at a potential game.  To be fair there are plenty of great flash games out there. Unbeknownst to me, apparently Adult Swim has published some good games.  As a result of my doubts, I held off on buying it for a while.\n\nSuper House of Dead Ninjas is a fast paced action platformer.  You play as a ninja trying to make her way down to the bottom of a tower filled with all sorts of traps and monsters.  The tower is semi-randomly generated so each run will be somewhat different from the last.  At the start of each run the player can select  a melee weapon, a ranged weapon, a bomb, and a magical attack.  There is also a chaos mode which provides a random selection of items.  In order to unlock new items you must accomplish specified challenges.  I found that trying to unlock the different items and upgrades was as fun as using them.\n\nSadly, there is one flaw with the way they handled the unlocks.  On the item selection screen there are items that the game says you must buy the DLC to unlock.  I've never been a fan of this sort of practice and would prefer base games to have no or minimal references to DLC.  It is a form of in game advertising and it makes games feel incomplete and cheap.  I suppose you could consider the fact that the DLC is inexpensive to be a saving grace, but I still don't like how this was handled.\n\nWhile the game doesn't have much of a storyline, the way it's told is creative.  There is a short comic book integrated into the game that tells the story and provides the basics of playing the game.  The comic is well drawn, but I wish there were actually additional issues as hinted towards the end.  The presentation of the rest of the game is solid as well.  It's very clear MegaDev was going for a 16-bit era feel.  Right when the game is booted up and while it's loading, a Super Nintendo styled box for Super House of Dead Ninjas is displayed.  One thing caught my eye about this though.  The loading text mentions blast processing which was a marketing gimmick from Sega and not Nintendo.  It's unimportant, but it feels like a small detail that shouldn't have been hard to get right.\n\nI'm happy my initial doubts for this game weren't confirmed.  It feels great to rush to the bottom of the tower as fast as possible.  The variety of useful items and high mobility of the main character make the game reminiscent to the Ninja Gaiden series.  The gameplay is addictive, and it's easy to play a quick run in 10 minutes or less.  That said, the game is short.  It took me about four hours to go from never having played the game to beating it on hard mode.  I've found myself return to it several times already due to the high level of replayability.  It isn't hard to see that someone could spent a lot of time getting all of the unlocks.  I recommend this to game fans of action platformers, and to people that wonder what it would be like if Sonic the Hedgehog and Ninja Gaiden's Ryu Hyabusa had a child together.\n\n[url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/25660729-CelerySpin/]Like the review?

Based on the 2011 flash game [url=http://www.adultswim.com/games/web/house-of-dead-ninjas][i]House of Dead Ninjas[/i][/url], the game challenges players to enter a tower known as the Ziggurat of Infinium through the roof and descend down its hundreds of floors, battling the tower\u2019s demonic occupants in a frenetic quest to discover what lurks on the ground floor.\n\nYou can tell from the game\u2019s title what kind of tone [i]Super House of Dead Ninjas[/i] is trying to invoke. The deliberately cheesy, over-the-top style of action is reminiscent of things like the old [i]Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles[/i], with a healthy dosage of wall-to-wall ultra-violence seemingly pinched from a Quentin Tarantino film. The game is packed with testosterone-filled voice-overs to mock you when you fail and commend you when you do something particularly \u201cHellacious\u201d. Combined with an early '90s platformer aesthetic, [i]Super House of Dead Ninjas[/i] has a nice little retro-style vibe about it, making the whole joint seem all the more outrageous and light-hearted.\n\nBehind the cartoony visuals, however, are modes with some pretty vicious difficulty. While the Ziggurat is gory cakewalk on normal difficulty, the challenge is amped up pretty quickly once you get to extra dungeons, particularly the endgame \u2018Abarghus\u2019 Domain\u2019. The unlockable weapons are a lot of fun to use, mostly because they\u2019re deliberately more difficult to use than the defaults, but reward skill with bonuses like the ability to destroy traps. Some of the combinations you can use are insane, particularly those which allow you to skip multiple floors at a time.\n\nThe problem with the difficulty is that a lot of the parts that are hard are just a select few especially brutal rooms that may or may not be inserted into your run through random generation. It isn\u2019t a massive issue, but it can get a little frustrating when the game generates several difficult rooms in quick succession.\n\nAnother thing I love about [i]Super House of Dead Ninjas[/i] is the support for speedrunning. The [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/238570/][i]True Ninja Pack[/i][/url] DLC unlocks a dedicated speedrun mode that times your descent and recording your respective times for the three areas (the Roof, Abyss of Nature and Royal Sanctum) as well as your overall run time. It\u2019s a nice, surprising touch that really adds to the game\u2019s replayability and introduces an element of competition through Steam leaderboards that let you directly compare yourself to your friends.\n\nIn conclusion, [i]Super House of Dead Ninjas[/i] is worth not only its own price, but also the price of its DLC pack, as the replayability and overall polish of the game is just astounding.", "timestamp_created": 1468239485, "timestamp_updated": 1497526313, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508654", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24217861": {"recommendationid": "24217861", "author": {"steamid": "76561198155028863", "num_games_owned": 395, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 598, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468613056}, "language": "english", "review": "Just outstanding. 10/10 essential purchase.", "timestamp_created": 1468102312, "timestamp_updated": 1468102312, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24198214": {"recommendationid": "24198214", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026286441", "num_games_owned": 494, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1064, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468683521}, "language": "english", "review": "If you like Sliders and ASMR, you're gonna love this one.", "timestamp_created": 1468037560, "timestamp_updated": 1468037560, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24170343": {"recommendationid": "24170343", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068773836", "num_games_owned": 163, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 3079, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509835394}, "language": "english", "review": "If you don't have time to play a full game, then this game great as a run can maybe be 20 minutes or less.", "timestamp_created": 1467937347, "timestamp_updated": 1496626609, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.999000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24148431": {"recommendationid": "24148431", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046551574", "num_games_owned": 80, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 281, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467861324}, "language": "english", "review": "nasa approved", "timestamp_created": 1467859434, "timestamp_updated": 1467859434, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24089932": {"recommendationid": "24089932", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995410267", "num_games_owned": 231, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 185, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478558182}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game.", "timestamp_created": 1467659343, "timestamp_updated": 1467659343, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24029206": {"recommendationid": "24029206", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970646813", "num_games_owned": 119, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 933, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497205324}, "language": "english", "review": "Extremely fun. old school metroidvania rogue like. addictive", "timestamp_created": 1467496527, "timestamp_updated": 1467496527, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23996988": {"recommendationid": "23996988", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991010756", "num_games_owned": 457, "num_reviews": 360, "playtime_forever": 200, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467835977}, "language": "french", "review": "Ouais bof.

I still beat the game on normal in about 2 hours (it is very short), but never felt like I was having a good time, just pure frustration. The problem that blocked me from enjoying this game are the loose controls. I mean VERY loose. You slide around constantly and careen into enemies, environmental hazards, and bosses which are eventually beatable without taking any dmg because they are based purely on memorization. Because of the extremely slippery controls it is very tough, but it is do-able. I was taking about 1-3 hits per boss. The bosses take a long while to get to so the only real way you can get any practice on them is to get a user-made map that lets you boss run.\n\nI love platformer games and the reason I was able to beat the game so quickly without too much trouble was because I have always played platformers since I was a kid so I have some skill built up. Even so, I just did not enjoy the experience because of the incredibly loose slippery controls. If you look around, there are platformers out there that have much tighter controls without sacrificing the difficulty. Personally I hope we see less and less of these platformer games like this one and also \u201cThey Bleed Pixels\u201d that are only difficult for one single reason: loose slippery sliding controls. Example of a game with tight controls: Megaman games, or Super Time Force Ultra. If Megaman's controls felt like this, it would to this day be debated whether it was a good game or not, rather than unanimously be hailed as a good game like it is now. It would have been inexcusable and would not have been tolerable by most people and there wouldn't be as many Megaman's as there are now.

Killing enemies will fill the bar.\nYou are able to unlock new upgrades and equip them, You can only equip 1 upgrade at each categories. There is a Katana/Bomb/Magic and Shuriken category. You can see and check the requirement to unlock that certain upgrade. \nOnce hit by an enemy you will get some vulnerability frames and destroy any enemies instantly (to avoid chain hits).

Sure, I should have known that before I even started playing Super House of Dead Ninjas, but it's nice to have confirmation.\n\nI've died a lot. Countless times, really. Not enough to earn the achievement \"Dedication,\" which one gets for dying a whooping 1000 times, but that achievement should tell you that this is a game about living for mere minutes. Thankfully, those minutes are filled with blood-soaked joy, certainly enough so that dusting one's self off and starting again isn't too great a chore.\n \n\n\nSuper House of Dead Ninjas (PC)\nDeveloper: Megadev\nPublisher: Adult Swim Games\nRelease: February 18, 2013\nMSRP: $6.99\n\nNintai Ryoko, the super-charged ninja and title's protagonist, is a woman on a mission. Her goal: to travel to the bottom of a hellish tower, one apparently filled with treasures and the promise of glory. She doesn't want any of that, however; instead, she intends to discover what happened to the one ninja who succeeded before her, the one-armed ninja. \n\nGetting to the bottom is easier said than done, what with it containing a myriad of horrors, from undead warriors, evil spirits, dragon guardians, and crazy monkeys, to traps ranging from floor and ceiling spikes to laser cannons. It's no easy task, but Nintai has a plethora of violent tools at her disposal.\n\nShe starts of with a basic katana, some shuriken, bombs, and one magic spell, but a vast array of unlockable weapons and tools can be earned for completing all sorts of challenges. Unlocks and upgrades can be picked up at a shop run by a sour old woman. She's dismissive and doesn't think you'll get very far. I didn't like her, and instead of seeking the fate of the one-armed ninja, I really just wanted to show that hag who the boss was. Her and the omnipresent voice that crops up from time to time judging my actions and mocking my many, many failures.\n\nAt the shop, you can see what needs to be done to unlock any of these items or upgrades, but most of them can really just be earned by playing the game without sparing them a thought. Finding out that I could use grenades or had a new pair of nunchucks that I could snatch after yet another death really softened the blow. Who doesn't like presents?\n\nAll the cool toys in the world won't make a difference without skill, however, and that's the area where I found myself rather lacking. Dead Ninjas is an insanely fast game, with Nintai being, more often than not, nothing but a blue (or whatever color her ninja robes are, there are several to unlock) streak, speeding across the screen. This speed is a necessity, too, as the game is on a timer, counting down to failure. Pick-ups can be discovered which add more time to the counter, but there's always the feeling that you're running low.\n\nHaste inspires recklessness, unfortunately, and that lack of caution spells death. Nintai can sprint past some enemies, slicing and dicing as she goes along, but others have shields, require more than one hit, are covered in spikes, fling projectiles, teleport, or are exceptionally fast, and they require a split-second analysis before tackling -- there's no time for more. So speed becomes dangerous, despite being key. \n\nAt first, this led to an agonizing amount of frustration, as Nintai continually got turned into a red smear on the floor of this unwelcoming tower, but I was getting irritated by my own failings, not the design of the game. I got carried away by the delightful 16-bit violence and extreme pace, and would just run into confrontations without a second thought. Practice and experience made me a slightly better ninja. Make no mistake, however, I'm still terrible. \n\nIt's all about getting into a rhythm, and when you start to recognize enemies, it takes less than a second to recall the best way to slay them. Continually slaughtering the tower's residents in quick succession builds up Nintai's quickly diminishing rage meter, and when it's activated she becomes an unstoppable force of destruction. Those moments are the game's best, sprinting down the tower as an invincible, deadly whirlwind. And the more enemies you kill while in rage mode, the longer it lasts. \n\nThe floor layouts, enemy placements, and item locations are all randomly generated, making each new game after a death a fresh experience. Sure, it means that you won't be memorizing the levels, but it also means you won't have to play through the same section over and over again, which would certainly happen in a game this tricky.\n\nFilling out the roster of ghastly enemies are a bunch of rather unfriendly bosses, and a very traditional bunch they are, too. They all come with special abilities, patterns that must be memorized (usually simple ones), and weaknesses that can be exploited. While challenging, most of them have a fairly small amount of health and can be dispatched quite quickly once you figure out how to deal with them.\n\nI'm not the most patient of fellows, so I appreciated the fact that these villains didn't outstay their welcome. Die while fighting them, though, and you'll be sent back to the beginning of the section, a hundred floors above them. \n\nAppropriately for a challenging game such as this, Super House of Dead Ninjas sends you into the fray with only minimal instruction. There is, however, a rather novel tutorial in the form of a comic, accessible from the main menu. Contained within are little tips and tricks that the main game doesn't really share with you, and one one occasion it even offered me the key to defeating a boss I'd been struggling with. It's well worth reading, and even rewards players with a new costume.\n\nSuper House of Dead Ninjas can be played for free on the Adult Swim website, but getting it on Steam nets you an upgraded version. The map editor and player-created dungeons offer up tools for you creative types and a bounty of new levels for those that can't get enough of the main game and its extra, transdimensional tower. It also comes with added items and unlockables, as well as an upgraded soundtrack. The latter is cracking, as well, containing some wonderful oriental-themed chiptunes. \n\nThis is one game that I know I'll be playing long after this review is finished with. The instant challenge and frantic pace makes it perfect to just pick up and play for 15 minutes, while the tight controls and potentially limitless number of floors makes it easy to pour hours into. If you're not convinced, then check out the free version and see if it floats your boat.\n\nI do have one caveat, however. Whatever you do, don't play this with a keyboard. It's possible, but you'll just be giving yourself another unnecessary and fairly unpleasant challenge. Thankfully, Super House of Dead Ninjas comes with native controller support, and after a few initial hiccups, it seems to work perfectly now.\n \n\nSuper House of Dead Ninjas reviewed by Fraser Brown\n9/10\nSUPERB\n\nA hallmark of excellence.

It is not unfair like some other 2D platformers that try to be hard for the sake of being hard, this game is very fun and satisfying to play. Controller is highly recommended. You go down a certain number of floors in the tower then fight a randomly selected boss for that level, by performing certain actions during gameplay you can unlock extra weapons & items which randomly drop as you kill enemies.

Turns out that I loved playing it. The game is simple - you must get down through a tower as fast as possible (you have a timer which you can find item pickups to extend) and fight bosses and, well, reach the bottom.\n\nBut, the tower is randomly generated each time that you play. The height of the tower remains the same, and you encounter the same number of bosses (though they have a small chance to change too, except for the final boss). But the rooms themselves and the enemies that you come across will shift a ton. Some of the rooms you get are super easy to get through quickly; some are just terrible pains. For a while it's just up to luck.\n\nHowever, you get to build yourself up the more you play. There are a ton of weapons and power-ups you can obtain by meeting certain goals, some of which are actually negative goals - for instance, you gain more lives after you die certain numbers of times, or you gain extra time on the timer after you reach certain points in the tower. Some of the upgrades are permanent like the ones just mentioned, or the weapons you unlock, while others get unlocked but are randomly found by killing enemies or destroying objects.\n\nWhile it certainly takes some getting used to, the game is a lot of fun and can be played for a good amount of time for some challenge. However, once you unlock most things and have successfully completed the game numerous times, I don't think it has that much of a long life. I still have the DLC to get and try out with some new content, and I tried the side-world that requires collected tickets to play in... And while it all is still fun to varying extents, I don't think I'll play the game in big time periods much - there isn't enough longevity to it. But others may find that to be different!

Pity me and my poor time management skills, then praise me for my foresight.  That being said, now onto the randomizer!\n\nToday's review was one that I have quite a bit of familiarity with, though not necessarily through Steam.  Super House of Dead Ninjas was originally a flash game Megadev released via the Adult Swim website.  In that game, you play a female master of the ninja arts, utilizing various bladed methods of slaughter to plow your way downwards from the top of the tower, never stopping to wonder why you didn\u2019t simply try to knock on the front door, or whether or not any of the various tower denizens would rather just let you waltz on by instead of offending you enough to cause you to split their skulls open with a melee weapon.  The Steam version is not that different, that is to say that it is still an excellent example of platformer madness, that it still has wonderfully easy controls, and that it still whups lots of butt.  The game is very reminiscent of the games released during the 16 bit era (hence the Super prefix in the title) and has definitely got the 'Nintendo Hard' difficulty thing down, especially in the lower levels.  The game does an excellent job of ramping up the difficulty level as the floors progress, making the randomly generated floors more infuriating as the levels go on, and with the scaling limited lives and continues, the game does place an emphasis on precision over brute force without making things inaccessibly difficult.  All in all, the game is one that you should definitely put time into, whether it be here or with the flash version.  A buy from me.\n\nGame\u2019s Fate: Kept.  This is a platformer I can get behind, addictive, fun and infuriating.\nBuy/No Buy: I would support this one with a buy anytime.  That being said, it does have a flash version that is similar.  If you have games you want more, keep this on your wishlist till it goes on sale and play the flash version till it does.\n", "timestamp_created": 1455960334, "timestamp_updated": 1455960334, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21096252": {"recommendationid": "21096252", "author": {"steamid": "76561198203407209", "num_games_owned": 95, "num_reviews": 77, "playtime_forever": 937, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1455070711}, "language": "english", "review": "Super House of Dead Ninjas is not a good game. It's not even a decent game. Passable? Maybe. But beneath it's addictive kill system, there isn't much to it. There's just so little variation in everything, and the weapons are horrifically unbalenced. Perhaps unexpectedly, I'm not bitter over it being a formerly free game. I think there's actually enough added to make it worth, if not the exact price, being put up for sale at all. But the additions are too little too late and don't help much. Plus, what's with the DLC? It's so cheap, and hits a weird balence between not adding much yet locking things you'd really think should be in the base game. When not on sale, Super House of Dead Ninjas is roughly 6.99 and the DLC is 2.99. Couldn't they be 9.99 and come together by default? Even if the DLC came later, it's a weird situation. I guess it doesn't make much of a difference, so whatever.\n\nHaving gotten it while it was really cheap, I can't complain too much.

I don't feel like it's the most random rogue like out there, the levels feel generally the same each run. the thing is, the speed of the game makes up for that. you are going too fast that level generation doesn't really seem that important. \n\nwhy is the game so fast paced? first off, there is a timer in the bottom right that counts down from 35 seconds. if that timer hits 0, prepare to get chased by a demonic figure until you get another timer pickup. this function makes you rush as fast as possible through each level. another thing that makes it fast is that your character moves at a speedy rate. also the reason I play ridiculously fast is because honestly, the only gameplay I've seen is speedruns ( which SHODN is perfect for ). \n\nitems are not a big part in this game; the items on the floors are only pickups that increase amount of magic, projectiles, and time. there are starting weapons you can unlock, but so far they don't really seem that different? they are fairly balanced as well. the unlock system is nice, like some unlocks you just get from simply doing runs normally, but some require different challenges to do. no weapon seems necessarily OP, they just have a longer range or some other small bonus.\n\nenemies aren't very varied, which is one of the only cons to SHODN. they add 2 or 3 new enemy types for each \"zone\" and that's it. the thing is, enemy variation isn't needed! you tear through each enemy so fast that it really doesn't matter!\n\nbosses are challenging, but aren't grinding bosses with loads of health. they are just simple bosses with a couple patterns to master, so honestly, they are more of a miniboss than a full fledged boss. again, I haven't fought the final boss myself so I don't know if he's any more interesting than the other bosses.\n\noverall, I give this game a 9/10!\n", "timestamp_created": 1449173919, "timestamp_updated": 1449173919, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516966", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19463828": {"recommendationid": "19463828", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056274697", "num_games_owned": 89, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 934, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477432975}, "language": "english", "review": "Game is more verbally abusive then my Alcoholic Step-Dad.\n\n10/10 would be called idiot again.", "timestamp_created": 1449172201, "timestamp_updated": 1449172201, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19420120": {"recommendationid": "19420120", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088299364", "num_games_owned": 143, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 489, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1455261256}, "language": "english", "review": "Adult swim really knows good video games", "timestamp_created": 1448997620, "timestamp_updated": 1448997620, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19396167": {"recommendationid": "19396167", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030784511", "num_games_owned": 99, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 467, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1453318916}, "language": "portuguese", "review": "\u00c9 dif\u00edcil, \u00e9 frustrante, \u00e9 exagerado e eu adoro.", "timestamp_created": 1448913531, "timestamp_updated": 1448913531, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502262", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19395065": {"recommendationid": "19395065", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021530025", "num_games_owned": 135, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 480, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492530524}, "language": "english", "review": "Its ok.

It's one of the early examples of roguelite platformers inspired by Spelunky, but it is however definitely very unique and stands out in its own right.\n\nFirst, it's extremely fast paced. Games like Spelunky or Rogue Legacy usually expect you to be slow and cautious - here, you also need to be observant, but you've got short time limit to find a timer pickup or you die- so you need to think on your feet, judging what is the fastest way to scale dangers ahead of you without getting hit. In fact, it's very arcade styled - winning the entire game shouldn't take longer than 15 minutes if you know what you're doing, but the game is extremely hard so you will spend hours practicing and learning your enemies to reach that point.\n\nSecond, it's very focused on action. Combat is meat of the gameplay, with a lot of depth to it - you are always equipped with three kinds of weapons and two special abilites (Zelda 2-like downstab and a jump spin attack) that let you approach any enemy encounter tactically. Platforming isn't too shabby either, since the game will require you to jump over spikes or swim through water, and you can wallslide, walljump, double jump (or even triple jump with the right item), super jump by crouching for a long time, crawl and glide.\n\nThird interesting feature are unlockables. Unlike most roguelite games winning the game on Normal difficulty isn't that hard of a task and can be accomplished in 6-10 hours - but this isn't what the game is truly about. See, unlike most of these games there IS a pernament progression to this game - unlocking new stuff. You unlock bonuses that extend your timer or give your new lives, but most unlockables are new weapons. This is also where most depth of the game comes in - you have plenty of melee weapons to replace your standard katana, including a baseball bat, whip or lightsaber; instead of throwing shurken like most ninjas you can simply get a gun, a boomerang or even do a Hadouken from Street Fighter; and replace your bombs with molotov coctails or dynamite that allows you to blow up the terrain! All these weapons have unique properties that make them interesting choices in some situations. And of course you can mix things up with Chaos Mode that allows you to pick random weapons every session, requiring you to adapt to new situations.\n\nFourth unique things is level design - unlike most Roguelike games levels of the tower aren't completely randomly generated but tower is instead built from premade \"blocks\", combining best of both worlds - each playhtrough will still be unique and unpredictable, while game allows finely crafted and polished challenges and moments that only a human designer can create.\n\nOf course, by its very nature this isn't a game you can sit down and play for hours, it's more suited to short sessions. But I assure you, the bite-sized frantic hard-as-nails (but never unfair) addictive action will keep you coming back everytime you need a coffee break. I should know, as of writing this I clocked over 30 hours just from these short sessions.\n\nIs it worth its price? Being honest, I gotten more enjoyment out of this game than from Spelunky or Rogue Legacy, much more popular games, and it is over two times cheaper than them. It's not perfect - there are couple weird design decisions like Parachute bonus that slows you down when falling (a bane of speedrunners) - but you can literally count them on fingers of one hand.\nIf you like fast-paced arcade platformers, you will definitely fall in love with this game.\n\nOh!

On to the real review. \n\nThis game is speed platforming at its finest. With a 30-second timer pushing you along, you really have to think fast to progress through the floors of the tower while killing enemies and replenishing the timer along the way. You have several tools in your arsenal: melee weapons, ranged weapons, and bombs all have their uses, and you also have magic spells to help out in a pinch. Melee and ranged weapons will be your main combat tools, because you have a limited number of bombs and magic to use. Some enemies will kill you before you can reach them with a melee attack, so you'll have to use a ranged attack to kill them. This adds an element of strategy, because you need to decide when to attack with which weapon. And as you progress, you will unlock other weapons to use beyond the standard katana, shuriken, and bombs. For example, I use \"Death's Gleaming Scyth\" for my melee weapon, which beheads all enemies, and \"Scorpion's Hookshot\" for my ranged weapon, which is essentially a deadly grappling hook. Bomb upgrades are a little harder to come by, so I just use the standard bomb for now. There are 11 melee weapons, 14 ranged weapons, and 12 bombs to choose from, plus 4 magic spells, for a total of 7,392 different weapon combinations to choose from. Add to that all the various item and weapon upgrades, such as adding extra lives or being able to carry more bombs, and you have quite an incentive to keep playing the game because there are just so many things to unlock. \n\nGameplay is exactly what you'd expect from a ninja game with a 30-second timer: hectic and fun. There are lots of different enemies to face, and they each act a little bit differently. Some will throw ranged attacks at you, others just run back and forth in an area, and many more. This makes playing the game a lot more interesting than just \"melee attack anything that moves\" because you'll need to be smart and know when to duck to avoid a ranged attack, how to counter enemies that can block your attacks if they see you coming, etc. \n\nThe physics in this game are perfect for a frantic platformer. Gravity must be higher in this world, because you fall really fast, which helps you progress more quickly but also makes it harder to plan for sneak attacks from above. You can also cling to walls or double jump to slow yourself down or reach higher places, which is a nice touch. \n\nSHODN's music is great, very Oriental-feeling but with a nice upbeat tempo that reminds me a bit of \"Kung Fu Fighting\" by Carl Douglas. Perfect for a ninja beat-em-up (or in this case, cut-em-up).\n\nOverall, this is one of my favorite modern platformers. It's fun and crazy, with enough strategy and variety to keep me interested and coming back for more. Definitely recommended for any fans of platforming games, or anyone who wants to kill lots of pixelated ninjas and die a lot. Because you will die A LOT, especially when you're first starting out and learning which enemies do what.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you enjoy my reviews, why not follow my curation page?

I've played too many PC platformers as of late with slippery movement (I'm looking at you Spelunky) but it's very satisfying here. It really focuses on your reaction and skill which strives to make you improve. Very few deaths aren't your fault and the game rewards you for building upon your developing ability.\n\nThe pixel graphics aren't perfect but they aren't bad either. I do appreciate that while it has the retro angle going for it, it doesn't fall into the retro traps of being overly difficult or intentionally confusing. That said, later areas of the game can get *hard* depending on which mode you are on, but the learning curve is never unfair.\n\nThere are also a fair number of bonus features beyond the story mode. There are tons of unlockables, different weapons and spells, even costumes if you have the patience. I've also had a good bit of fun messing around in the level editor. While not terribly robust it shows how far you can truly push the game engine and your own abilities.\n\nThe game isn't perfect, there do tend to be glitchy parts (more than once I fell out of the side of the tower) but overall it is a well put together and fun package.

It's fairly easy to learn and especially difficult to master. Even when you think you've gotten to a point where you can just plow through the floors as quickly as possible, the game says, \"No,\" and hits you in the face with a hidden saw blade, or a flying enemy, or the challenge of the bosses each of the way through.\n\nIf I'm rating the game on a number scale, I'm probably going to give it in the range of 8-9 out of 10. But the game is not without its flaws. First, there's the hit box: it's inconsistent. Most of the time it's exactly as you'd expect. You swing your sword (or 'chuks, or whip) and you hit your target. But there are times where I see the weapon sprite contact with the enemy sprite and it does no damage. This happens enough for it to be an issue, but not so much that it's a game stopper.\n\nThe other big issue has to do with telegraphing. The enemies don't really do a good job of it, and you'll very easily find yourself dying or getting hit by the enemies and bosses because there's little to no indication of a telegraphed attack. Compound this with a double jump that's a little low and you'll find sometimes that you have to be perfect more often then you should need in some cases to proceed. (Edit: I just found the super jump after writing the review, so that makes some boss fights potentially a bit easier.)\n\nNow these aren't really \"big\" issues in the normal sense; but in the context of the game, they can add up to some pretty frustrating moments.\n\nAll in all though, the game is a fantastic platformer with a super progression path and you should definitely check it out.", "timestamp_created": 1417231084, "timestamp_updated": 1417242493, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503798", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13095767": {"recommendationid": "13095767", "author": {"steamid": "76561198116406731", "num_games_owned": 110, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 685, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503031323}, "language": "english", "review": "I played the flash one a year before this one and this one adds some new items and the DLC is awsome", "timestamp_created": 1417040003, "timestamp_updated": 1417040003, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502258", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13085680": {"recommendationid": "13085680", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077180717", "num_games_owned": 103, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 641, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1436848800}, "language": "english", "review": "Super House of the Dead Ninja's is one of the best games I have ever spent money on.

The difficulty can be unappealing to some, and the random elements of the game sometimes do feel unfair, but overall for me randomness is one of the reasons the game is so enjoyable and replayable.\n\nThis game also does retro right, with reminiscent sound effects, controls, enemies and just overall presentation.

The action is great, the movements are fluid and the premise is quite simple: survive traversing through the floors going down to reach the end boss. It was only a week or so later that I got my hands on a proper Razer controller. When I played with the ocntroller instead, I felt the change in my game performance; the difference was astronomical! I enjoyed it better and I had also finally beat the boss (normal).\n\nLet's get one thing straight, though. Even with the controller at my disposal, the game was still rather difficult. It was indeed hard but it was at the same time fun! It wasn't that kind of challenge where I got frustrated. It was the kind of challenge that pushed me to be more careful and efficient with every single button I pressed. It really made me feel like a true ninja; a ninja that makes the most out of their items and resources in completing tasks. Every move, every second; they were all essential to my victory in this game!\n\nGames like this are truly worth every $ spent for. Did I mention that there is a Map Editor? Go ahead and pick this gem up now and if you can, \"gift\" it to your friends too! This game is beyond perfection 11/10.\n\nNOTE: Best played with a controller (I used Razer Sabertooth)", "timestamp_created": 1409732418, "timestamp_updated": 1409732418, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11913996": {"recommendationid": "11913996", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060969936", "num_games_owned": 61, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 451, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1394743662}, "language": "english", "review": "Super House of Dead Ninjas (SHoDN for short) is an action-packed platformer with a multitude of fun. The game is meticulously developed with intense care. Although it lacks immersion, it's an arcade game; who the f**k cares? There is also a comic, which I encourage you to read, or even glance at, to accumulate some insight into the game.\n\nThe degree of scrupulousness in this game is eminent. The developers have taken high precision into the construction of this game. If there is a conspicuous glitch, please notify me, because I am impressed with how smooth-running this game is. I am fastidious myself, or in other words: show symptoms related to OCD, and I commend the developers for being conscientious.\n\nAugmenting on that note, for a 2D game, the graphics will prevail over most art-style games that I have played. The particle systems are astounding; as I mentioned above, the developer is very diligent and takes care of his work. SHoDN also incorporates blood into the game, albeit, if you dislike it, then there is an option to disable it.\n\nNow, let's discuss the game itself. What makes Super House of Dead Ninjas miraculous; what is so significant about its gameplay? Well... there is the adrenaline of escaping a mansion, and if you take too long, a demon emerges to eviscerate you. I am unsure whether it is conjured, or if it just simply catches up to you. Anyway, there is the exuberance of racing through each level, and fighting the boss which concludes it. SHoDN will make you feel zealous; full of energy, with the incentive of completing each level.\n\nThe plethora of achievements also motivate players to continue playing; if you want to unlock a new weapon or item, you must perform a strenuous, but rudimentary task (e.g. kill 100 enemies using an inaccurate bomb). Obviously, more powerful items require a more onerous task.\n\nThe world itself is randomised, eerie and ominous. However, some would argue that it lacks immersion. My following argument is contentious, but I believe that an arcade game, especially a 2D one, does not require immersion. Arcade games derive from the style of \"arcade machines\", and if you have ever played on an arcade machine, then presumably, you would understand. If you disagree, please enlighten me; conceptualise this game as an arcade machine, and tell me that it requires immersion.\n\nTo conclude, Super House of Dead Ninjas is an action-packed platformer with a myriad of amusement. The game is well-developed, and I will personally punch anyone in the face who disagrees. This game is truly memorable, and I encourage you not to be prejudice based on the concept. ~ Rating: 9.4/10", "timestamp_created": 1409350765, "timestamp_updated": 1409351424, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.937724", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11867713": {"recommendationid": "11867713", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970938512", "num_games_owned": 858, "num_reviews": 56, "playtime_forever": 301, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1413647972}, "language": "english", "review": "Jump.

You become invincible during this and kill everything in 1 hit, not counting bosses. \n\nThe game also has an awesome unlock system. I don't know the exact number, but somewhere around 75 different unlockable equipment, abilities and powerups are in the game. I really like this unlock system, because the better you do in the game, the better unlocks you will get access to for your next run.

The addition of the level editor is always nice, although I have not yet delved into it enough to fully pick it apart.

However, the fact that the game is so short also ensures that the level of difficulty is never frustrating, and the unlocking of power-ups and upgrades through completing challenges gives the game a nice flow, as even failures can help you progress in the future, both from learning from your mistakes and gaining those unlockable boosts.\n\nAll in all, SHODN is one of the best examples of how to make a retro-style game with all of the challenge and almost none of the frustration.", "timestamp_created": 1403405398, "timestamp_updated": 1403405398, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10640516": {"recommendationid": "10640516", "author": {"steamid": "76561198114078814", "num_games_owned": 25, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 135, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475278474}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10 I recomend this game 100%", "timestamp_created": 1403396884, "timestamp_updated": 1403396884, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10632120": {"recommendationid": "10632120", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075071727", "num_games_owned": 510, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 452, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1457459971}, "language": "english", "review": "i've died over 300 times in an hour of gameplay\n\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1403382199, "timestamp_updated": 1403382199, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10623335": {"recommendationid": "10623335", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060150901", "num_games_owned": 683, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 149, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1422712276}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0421\u043c\u0435\u0441\u044c \u0441\u0443\u043f\u0435\u0440\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0431\u043e\u044f \u0441 \u043d\u0438\u043d\u0437\u044f \u0433\u0430\u0439\u0434\u0430\u043d\u043e\u043c \u0438 \u0440\u043e\u0433\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043c. \u0411\u0435\u0448\u0435\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0433\u0435\u0439\u043c\u043f\u043b\u0435\u0439, \u0446\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0440\u043d\u044b \u043a\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0449\u0438, \u0440\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0438 \u0448\u0438\u043a\u0430\u0440\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043c\u0443\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0430. \u0421\u0442\u043e\u0438\u0442 -

Throughout your subsequent playthroughs, you will unlock new weapons that will add some variety to the game. There's so much to do with ample challenge placed every step of the way. Controls are precise and smooth and there are lots of weapons with upgrades that act as objectives. You can unlock power ups by completing other objectives as well as upgrades to items / lives. The boss fights keep you on your toes and Hard mode tasks you with no continues. I felt myself walking on hot coals with my progress as the rewards were set behind more bars than I could count.

Super House Of Dead Ninjas is kind of like that. It's not a perfect comparison, but it provides a general idea of what you can expect.\n\nSHODN is a platformer without levels in the traditional sense. The game is one long level, which is semi-procedurally generated as you descend ever lower. It is not fully procedural because the game creates this super-level by drawing from an inventory of handmade \"rooms\". The enemies that populate the rooms are fixed in some cases, but for most are also selected randomly, as are the majority of the pickups to be found within. The types of rooms to be found range from simple corridors with an enemy or two, to labyrinthine beasts that will have you scratching your head trying to figure out how you're expected to make it through without dying.\n\nThe fact that the rooms are premade, but populated and thrown at you randomly, makes every run unique, and allows you to get better with practice through sheer muscle memory like a traditional platformer while still keeping you on your toes regarding what's coming next. No game provides player feedback quite like SHODN, with the voice of the final boss insulting you for making mistakes and praising you for impressive feats throughout the game, providing the game with a unique kind of personality.\n\nWhile you're practicing the game (mainly by dying a whole bunch), you can also unlock new weapons to start your runs with, as well as new pickups that will spawn in future runs. You unlock these by accomplishing goals listed in the loadoat screen while playing, very similar to achievements, only better because they provide new content to play with. (There are also standard achievements for those who like them.) Most of these unlockables are designed to make future runs easier, but certain weapon unlocks can provide entirely new approaches to the game. There's a nice variety of weapons to unlock, and even an option to start with a random loadout, providing a large number of ways to play the game. Be aware that some of the goals required to unlock things actively revel in their extreme difficulty, just like the game as a whole.\n\nThe fast-paced nature of the game is enforced by a timer. When the timer hits zero, Death himself will start chasing you through the level with a scythe. It's possible to outrun him for a little while, but you cannot outmaneuver him. Whereas Spelunky gives you 2 minutes before its ghost appears, SHODN only gives you 30 seconds to find a timer refill pickup to avoid this fate. If that sounds unforgiving, note that you start with multiple lives, which is good because you'll probably need every single one of them.\n\nBeing an indie game, it has some bugs and is unoptimized in a few areas, but I strongly encourage you to not let that put you off. With the near-infinite replayability provided by its random generation and addictively-difficult gameplay complemented by silky-smooth controls, I highly recommend SHODN, particularly to any fan of platformers.", "timestamp_created": 1396007727, "timestamp_updated": 1396007727, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501188", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9646210": {"recommendationid": "9646210", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003908203", "num_games_owned": 55, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 144, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1399054920}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000 \u3000\u3000\u3000\uff38\n\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u2220\uffe3\uff3c\u2229\n\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000 \u3000|/\uff9fU\uff9f|\u4e3f\n\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000 \uff5e\uff08\uff40\u4e8c\u2283\n\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\uff08\u3000\u30fd/\n\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000 \uff89>\u30ce\n\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000UU\n", "timestamp_created": 1395951581, "timestamp_updated": 1395951581, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491774", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9640774": {"recommendationid": "9640774", "author": {"steamid": "76561198109455579", "num_games_owned": 139, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 271, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1444060121}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041e\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f, \u0432 \u043c\u0435\u0440\u0443 \u0445\u0430\u0440\u0434\u043a\u043e\u0440\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0430\u0440\u043a\u0430\u0434\u0430.\n\n\u0412\u0430\u043c \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0434\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u044f \u0437\u0430 \u043a\u0440\u0443\u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0431\u0435\u0437\u044b\u043c\u044f\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043d\u0438\u043d\u0434\u0437\u044f \u0441\u043f\u0443\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \u043f\u043e \u0431\u0430\u0448\u043d\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0435\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043d\u044b\u043c\u0438 \u0432\u0440\u0430\u0433\u0430\u043c\u0438, \u0441\u043e\u0431\u0438\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043d\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0435 \u043c\u0435\u0447\u0438, \u0441\u044e\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0435\u043d\u044b, \u0431\u043e\u043c\u0431\u044b \u0438 \u0441\u043a\u0438\u043b\u044b. \u041f\u0440\u043e\u0439\u0434\u044f \u0431\u0430\u0448\u043d\u044e \u0432\u0430\u0441 \u0432\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0442\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0433\u0440\u043e\u0437\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0431\u043e\u0441\u0441.\n\u0421\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0443\u044e \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0442\u044c Hard \u0438 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0432 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0435 \u0443\u0434\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0435.\n\n\u041e\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430)", "timestamp_created": 1395900604, "timestamp_updated": 1395900604, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9613937": {"recommendationid": "9613937", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044989498", "num_games_owned": 387, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 167, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489786568}, "language": "english", "review": "Fast-paced fun w/ tight controls and a funny humour.

You are a ninja with a primary weapon, a secondary throwable weapon, one bomb variant as well as another form of magic. The game has only one difficulty, which is pretty hard all on its own. The only difference between the difficulty levels is the number of continues that you are able to use.\n\nSHODN plays like other rogue-likes in the manner of games like Spelunky or Risk of Rain, where you gain new weapons, abilities and other modifiers by playing more and more of the game. As you reach the end of a section, you will fight a boss (some stages have up to two randomized bosses) who have a particular gimmick to their attack patterns. Once complete, you proceed to the next area until you complete the game.\n\nThe game is a lot of fun, as it gives you the feel of a badass ninja through the game mechanics, level design, and the responsive nature of the game. The game runs at a cool 60 FPS due to its relatively low graphics requirements, and the controller input is also much more responsive as well. With this in mind, remember that your enemies also react at the same speed, so rushing down into the next room without checking the area is usually a really bad idea.\n\nOverall, the game has a lot of replay value as you are only allowed a single weapon, projectile and gadget per session. This will inevitably lead to a lot of experimentation as you find the weapons that best suit your playstyle or your speedrun attempt.

PLaying like an old school gem title of the SNES, (hence the name and the retro box art for the title) it has all the magic and nostalgic fun that lies there too but with a modern day shuriken to make it feel fresh.  With the mission of getting your customizable ninja to reach the bottom of a seemingly infinte dark tower, you get your kicks out weaving your way through out the different levels, batting demons, dragons, and killer frogs using your katana, throwing stars, and bombs, with a shinobi reminiscent special moves that can get you out of jam and quick.  you have a timer that counts down throught, and instead of progressing traditionally from one stage to the next, spotting clocks and picking them up increase your timer, allowing you to continue your descent (the latter is a demon dragon that comes to eat you and theres nothing you or your ninja prowess can do about it if the time runs out).  With a traditional 3 quarters and its game over rules to play by, the upside is that you can customize your weapons, abilities, even the ninja yourself, so there plenty to keep pressing contine about. Although it lacks a multiplayer component, which for a game like this would be pretty freaking awesome, it does well without.    The controls are tight for the most part, and supports full joystick compatibilty, which i would recommend for this fast paced downard dungeon explorer. My only gripe is that controls seem to depend widely on which weapon you use (i found that the scythe tends to slide me along a little further than i would bother when i attack) but all in all, a stellar modern retro game at its best, and does a genuis job at clashing the old with the new. \nThe Verdict?\n\n9.25/10\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1393714851, "timestamp_updated": 1393714851, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9289347": {"recommendationid": "9289347", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065539673", "num_games_owned": 169, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2411, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 36, "last_played": 1514145183}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a GREAT game!

It controls smoothly, it introduces new elements at just the moment you've mastered the old, unlocks occur at a decent click for completing challenges, and most importantly, it gets the difficulty just right - it doesn't start shit hard and get harder; it starts easy, and gives you generous checkpoints so you can practice just the section that's giving you grief without going through the motions for five minutes beforehand. Then, after it's given you room to practice and learn its mechanics - that's when it gets shit hard. It never feels cheap or unfair because of the breathing room it gives to beginners. Additionally, because you are DEscending a tower, there is always a strong sense of momentum, so the 30 second time limit doesn't feel punitive, but rather acts as a mechanical reinforcement of the play style most people will gravitate towards anyway. In short it's a well programmed, thoughtfully designed game that's a great deal of fun to play.

The gameplay is tight, the graphics are intresting and it's easy to quickly determine what's quickly coming towards you. Every single element that is in this game pushes forward a single theme for being an awesome extremely fast-paced action arcade game. \nBasically the gyst is you endlessly drop down and down through randomly generated enviromnents. The goal is to get as deep into the game as you can get. But to do that you have to slice the blood out of everything that moves. It even has freaking boss battles! Love it. \nIt's got a really good sense of action. First of all the controls are tight, and that's the most important thing really. And then they also have really cool combo systems where you can become invincible and just wreck everything all day. There's lots of differnet weapons too add to replayablility. and just slicing enemies feels really good. It's just the way the game feels, the particles, the sound, and the animations. The way that all meshes makes slicing dudes feel slick. Really slick. \nAnd personally I like that the game is really forgiving. In a lot of these types of games you get 1 life and then have to restart, but in this game you can die multiple times. You get like 15 lives right off the bat or something crazy like that. I really like that, it helps keep the action going. \nIt's one of those games that you'll lose, and then be like.... ok just 1 last run... i mean this time is the last time for sure.... oh but that run was crappy so it doesn't count... I get to keep playing until I get at least 1 good run.... \nthat sort of game. \n\nAlso this game feels pulled out of time almost. It feels like and old classic arcade game from another universe that everybody knows and loves, like pacman... only for some reason our universe didnt get that game... it's perfectly retro. \n\nI wouldnt reccomend this game to people who won't be able to keep up with all the action. It's a hard game and it move FAST, and it can be really overwhelming really quickly. So I reccomend checking out some gameplay vids first to see if the pace is too fast for your taste. \n\nHowever, if you can handle the difficulty and speed of this game please go buy it. I'm not sure if Its gonna be like my personal favorite game ever or anything like that, but it's definitly a perfect game by all standards.\nOH, and you'll probably want to use a controller for this. If you don't have one I think that not having a controller WOULD stop me from ever wanting to play this.

You play as a ninja warrior who wants to kill things. I'm totally 300% sure that's the story. You can read the story in comic book form in-game. I couldn't pull myself away from the actual gameplay for long enough to see that option in the main menu, though.\n\nThis game moves so fast (or, at least, you can move so fast). You just run through the tower killing anything that gets in your way and go for the boss. Simple, but very addictive.\n\nI should mention it's really easy to die in the game. Well, more accurately, it's really easy for me to get too complacent and reckless in the game. I died. A lot. I got the bonus lives perks really quickly (you can unlock them for dying a certain number of times in excess of 100) because I just died so much. I died because the game is incredibly fun to try and move through as fast as possible. \n\nThe game has a good way of knowing where you're going to do something silly too. The game really discourages you from moving quickly without knowing what certain enemies do. Man, what do those fast spiney things do? Oh, they kill you and kill you and kill you. There's good news. Since you lose a life in one hit, it becomes of paramount importance to avoid as many enemies as you can... while still trying to build rage.\n\nRage builds up by killing a certain amount of enemies while not dying. When the rage meter is fully charged, you are invulnerable until the meter depleats. This gives the player the ability to make a decision about moving quickly vs killing things to build up rage. \n\nAfter all the stuff I said about dying, I should mention that the game does deaths in a perfect way for this type of game: you regenerate where you are. While it might seem pretty obvious that that would be the case, it's important to distinguish this game from Mario type games. There are no checkpoints, but instead you can insantly revive where you died and even if you spend all your lives and get a game over, you can still rejoin the game where you are. \n\nThe soundtrack is nice too. It's certainly no Bit.Trip Runner, but it's still pretty thematic and well done.\n\nThe visuals are done in a retro-esque style which is a good design choice; it allows the whole game to be loaded all at once taking nothing away from gametime and player tempo.\n\nOverall, this game was an extremely fun expense of time.

Your entire goal is a to get to the bottom of the tower. Sounds simple, but you have a time limit. You have to pick up time power up to extend the time. You also have plenty of weapons and gear to chose from. A melee weapon, a ranged weapon, a bomb weapon and a magic spell. You choose these four things and off you go. The controls for the platformer are extremely tight and responsive. If you died it's your fault. Game is a perfect balance of fairness and challange. Your pace determines how well you do, if you go too quick you will run into a trap or a problem, going to slow and your timer is gonna tick down. When time goes down you don't die, the grim reaper shows up to kill you. You can evade him, if you are quick and skilled enough. \n\nFranky there doesn't need much to be said about this game.

The enemies crack me up, my favorite being the monkeys. Another fun feature is that the game will randomly create a special baddie named after someone in your friends list.\n\nThe game has a bit of a learning curve and it takes some time to figure out how to take on the enemies, traps, and mini-bosses.

When I first bought SHoDN during the summer sale, I played it about three times and I didn't get it.  There wasn't a lot of explanation to the game and with the over stimulation that the summer sale brings, I didn't have the attention span to sit down and give it a chance.  I wound up shutting the game down, vaguely wondering if I wasted $3 and proceeded to waste my time in other things. \n\nCut to three weeks later, I see people talking about SHoDN on the forums a lot and I figure I paid $3 for it; I might as well give it a shot.  The first time through, I thought the keyboard controls were a little cumbersome but I was starting to understand the game concept; score points, extend your time, get us far down the tower as you can. Seemed solid, it was starting to sink its claws in.  \n\nLater that morning, I was messaged by someone on my friends list, urging me to submit my scores so they had somebody to compete against on the leader boards.  I hadn't even realized there were leaderboards, so I played through again and submitted.  That's when the claws sunk in even deeper; competing against your friend\u2019s high scores is super addictive.  I figured I was in there, so I started clicking around in the menus and that's when I discovered that there's controller support in SHoDN!  Around this time, a game I thought I might have wasted my money on turned into a full on addiction.\n\nSHoDN is dead simple in concept, but with challenging maps and tight controls it turns into a great little time attack platformer.  It's difficult in all the right ways and its design of getting ever farther down the tower, combined with trying to outscore your friends list makes it a game you'll return to.  It\u2019s simple nature makes it a perfect fit for those times when you want 10 minutes of distraction instead of 3 hours of character development, but there's a strong chance it's going to suck you into that dreaded, \"just one more try\" state of mind. \n\nI've yet to try the new DLC that was added this week, but it's officially on the wish list!\n", "timestamp_created": 1375966945, "timestamp_updated": 1385406717, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504013", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "1752768": {"recommendationid": "1752768", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997457694", "num_games_owned": 985, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 2113, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1466458026}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is perfect.

Your mission is to make it to the bottom of a monstrous tower owned by the local demon lord. You heard me right, the bottom. You move very quickly, you attack very quickly, you die very quickly. The game also ends very quickly and can be finished within six or seven minutes if you really practice and speedrun the hell out of it. Every time you take a hit, you lose a life but instantly respawn where you were smacked. Run out of lives and you can continue, on normal. On hard if you run out of lives the game's over. But thankfully after beating a boss a third of the way down the tower, you have a continue point if you wish to play again, making a whole tower (~350 floors, that's actually not as bad as that sounds) run optional.\n\nIf you've noticed the awesomely outragous title yet, you'd be reminded of older games, maybe for the SNES. That's where the charm jumps in. Super House of Dead Ninjas is a side scroller platforming game with an emphasis on speed and difficulty, very much from older games. The game even comes with a handy dandy hint comic book which you can read if you feel like the game needs some story. You should also read it because it'll teach you some tricks that will allow you to actually survive your decent. And give you a free unlockable item. I usually don't like retro-esque games, but Super House of Dead Ninjas not only has a lot of charm, but uses the retro feel for more of an atmospheric effect rather than making it its main feature (see: Evoland) and it truly benefits from it (the game even slows down when a lot of action happens at once, a quick breather for us normal folk but if it's truly obnoxious you can turn it off in the options menu).\n\nFor $7 the game offers a ton of replayability and is perfect for those who desire something incredibly challenging in their gaming experience. Even if you finish the tower on Hard, there are still two randomly generated inifite towers to explore if you really feel like you have to show off. For those who would like to try before buying it, you can play the original version on Adult Swim's website. If you're still on the edge, wait for a sale.

And the fact that you will die and die a lot.

All the equipment you need is chosen from the lodge, the screen before the start of the game. Any other items you get inside the tower are ammo refills or boosts. So, every piece of equipment you get is permanent. And although you do need to choose which weapon/piece of equipment to use before the game, the items are usually better versions of older pieces; some of them are even direct powerups of previous weapons. This and the fact that almost everything you do (yes, even dying) counts towards an achievement which awards you with new and better equipment will lead to a \"power transfer\", where you will go farther and farther down the floors not only because of your own skill (which is one of the main reasons of a rogue title) but also because you will have much better equipment. \nStill, it is really satisfying to clear a floor with ease and defeat the floor boss without losing a single life when you used to take up all your lives just to get to the darn bugger. \nAlthough it slightly lacks the witt the developers Adult Swim are known for, the gameplay is way too satisfying to pass up. Honing your ninja skills and defeating baddies that killed you countless times with a single overhead strike feels absolute. \nThe action is amazing, the items are different and spaced out enough to keep you interested, the fact that every single achievement gives a new item adds replayability and the awesome price makes this little indie title a bargain of the decade.\nOh, and get yourself a controller.

The story is very minimal in this game. It\u2019s an arcade game, the gameplay is the most essential. You're Crimson Ninja, a deadly assassin who wants to descend a 250-Floor Tower filled with all sorts of hostile monster in order to prove her honour. That's preety much it. There is a nice and very well drawn comic book in the game, but it won't explain anymore than what I just wrote in the previous sentence.  Super House of Dead Ninjas combat system gives you a couple of options to fight with. You can use your main weapon, perform a dive attack, use a throwable consumable, use an explosive consumable (careful not to blow yourself up with it though) and use an ultimate powerful magic trick.  You will feel like a fast and skilled ninja. Don\u2019t get attacked too much, you only have a handful of health points.\n Enemy variation is good but it could always use more. Killing the same enemies isn't boring and some will require a special trick. The feedback is good, enemies get dismembered in a psychotically beautiful way and the blood splatters like paint into a canvas. You even have a narrator similar to that of Quake who compliments you if you\u2019re awesome and tells you off if you suck.\n\nThe bosses are a big meat of the game, get ready to rage a bit. They\u2019re all very unique and require some strategy and skill to finish them off. Even though they\u2019re hard, they\u2019re fair but I do believe that Colossus is too hard. In order to dodge him, you have to jump over him while he charges at you. But even if a pixel of your character touches the Colossus then try not to throw your monitor or laptop out of the window. This boss is ridiculously hard!\n\nThe upgrades are where I have a couple of problems with the game. I like that you have to unlock the items in a specific challenging way instead of simply grinding for the items like in RPGs. When you upgrade your health, for example, you can't turn off the upgrade and we encounter another issue. The leaderboards are therefore unfair because it doesn't take into account the upgrades you used. In Serious Sam games, the score will be influenced by the difficulty you choose. For example, if you chose easy, your score won't have a multiplier counter as high as of that of a player that chose a harder difficulty. Also, during the levels you can't check the requirements of unlocking certain; you have to remember them by heart. Now, you think that using new and different items helps the gameplay be more dynamic than it is, but that isn't the case. I find myself using the boomerang and the nunchucks more than other equipment. Furthermore, the game doesn't have preset equipment choice.\n\nOn the technical level, the game looks like it was made in the 1990\u2019s. The graphical style is pixilated and has so much charm for it. It even has effects to it to show your character\u2019s momentum and speed. It runs preety well but it can tank when there is a lot of effects on the screen. Still though, this version of House of Dead Ninjas, is better coded and has more configuration options. The game has an in-built Steam Workshop, but honestly, the custom made levels are too short.\n\nRegarding the expansion, if you think that the base game of Super House of Dead Ninjas wasn't enough for you then I recommend the True Ninja Pack. It\u2019s worth it really for the price. You even get to play it with a new ninja with different stats.\n\nIn conclusion, the game is great! I think it would be better if it would be played on a mobile device. It\u2019s a small game that should be played more than once and on the go. Still though, the game is worth it for sure and the price is fair!

The pacing is super fast as you work your way down the hundreds of floors that make up this enemy- and trap-infested tower.

Thankfully the game controls nicely with a 360 pad because I couldn't imagine executing some of these precise maneuvers on a keyboard. A strong variety of weapons/explosives/powerups at your disposal will aid you on your trek downward. Floors are randomly-generated, but for the most part each section feels mostly the same from one playthrough to the next. This could result in some repetitiveness over time. In spite of that, SHODN has a very addictive feel to it thanks to the overall pacing and arcade-style gameplay. Strikes me as a great \"Pick up and play\" type game for short 30-minute bursts in the same vein as The Binding Of Isaac.\n\nIn all, this is a highly enjoyable rogue-like that features some frantic action, crisp controls, and fun/satisfying combat.

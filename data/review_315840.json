There is something really special though about Catacomb Kids that I can't quite place my finger on.  Not sure if it's the fun physics, superior combat, interesting magic, complex items, tense exploring, or cool soundtrack.  Perhaps just the overall feel of the game pushes CK above and beyond the rest in its class.  Armor and wearable items actually changing the appearance of your pixel character, torch stands falling over and igniting enemies, throwing potions on baddies to learn their effects, and the ability to flavor a dead rat with hot sauce for some extra flavor are just a few prime examples of developer inguinity.  It's these small details and great mechanics that show the love the developer is putting into this game.  \n\nCK is a great rougelike cake with plenty of frosting and I'm excited to see how the entire game pans out.

It turns out that this game is so much more. Usually games of this genre are extremely frustrating and give little user-satisfaction. I love the fact that with every play through you learn something new which eliminates that feeling of \"why am I still playing this game?\" you know that feeling if your a fan of the genre, these mechanics and little details have you constantly think \"omg the developer thought of that?!?\". This is a game where the learning curve is extremely steep and will have you stuck. At the moment there are 3 classes and 5 weapon types, also your character's stats and equipment are randomly generated each time. Combat is amazing for a rogue-like and the AI is very well designed, as your enemies will dodge/roll and strike you making their fighting pattern very hard to read, this enables a very fluid style of playing where you have to roll with the punches and not get too complacent when it comes to battling enemies. This game is still in Alpha and I hope that this game gets 100% polished off asap as games of this genre have a very short shelf life. \n\nIf the developer is reading this comment I would like to say you have done a spectacular job at creating such a refreshing spin on the genre. Local Co-op makes this game one of my favourite of all time, however I WOULD LOVE TO SEE 4 PLAYER LOCAL CO-OP.\n\nIf you are reading this, do you have any plans in expanding local co-op to 4 player in the future? \n\nI understand it would be tricky as things would be hard to follow with 4 players bouncing around, but due to the pace you are able to play this game at (because of all the booby traps) it would work fantastically with 4 players who knew what they were doing. Also it could add another component to gameplay as a group of friends would plan team compositions. This 4 player local co-op could even be split via LAN with 2 players on each computer. \n", "timestamp_created": 1495540928, "timestamp_updated": 1495540928, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513906", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "31636364": {"recommendationid": "31636364", "author": {"steamid": "76561198105740702", "num_games_owned": 17, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 16422, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1919, "last_played": 1514371533}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8fd9\u7248\u672cbug\u592a\u591a\u4e86\uff0c\u7ecf\u5e38\u5954\u6e83\uff0c\u60f3\u5165\u624b\u7684\u6296M\u8981\u60f3\u597d\u4e86\u518d\u4e70....", "timestamp_created": 1494286079, "timestamp_updated": 1495183427, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493590", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "31450505": {"recommendationid": "31450505", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056022992", "num_games_owned": 99, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 7015, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 646, "last_played": 1513936133}, "language": "english", "review": "Still haven't managed to \"git good\" yet... :/", "timestamp_created": 1493504839, "timestamp_updated": 1493504839, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.383369", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "31068008": {"recommendationid": "31068008", "author": {"steamid": "76561197985844012", "num_games_owned": 444, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 411, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493256862}, "language": "english", "review": "Really fun and a lot of depth!\n\nEdit: Man... this game crashes a lot!", "timestamp_created": 1491860503, "timestamp_updated": 1492186291, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.385371", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30985931": {"recommendationid": "30985931", "author": {"steamid": "76561198098363514", "num_games_owned": 92, "num_reviews": 72, "playtime_forever": 1686, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494441930}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome rogulite arcade with RPG elements.

All you get is a magical weapon, which i guess is helpful, but not class changing good...i find its much easier to win fights as a wanderer, attacking at extremly quick paces where the enmies dies before they know whats going on.\n\nWanderer: Fast but 'weak', i prefer this class because even though you are 'weak', you can still do good damage, maybe 1-2 less than a bully, And you can attack very quickly, i've overwhelmed 4-5 orc things/skeletons at the same time while only doin 3-4 damage per hit. If you are low on health, you can just run through the catacombs and avoid getting hurt any more until you find a way to heal yourself.\n\nPoet: The Spells deplete.................... If you are a Poet, who specializes in casting spells to win fights and progress throughh the game, AND YOU RUN OUT OF SPELLS !!!!! Then you are sooooooooo screwed. Chances are you spent all of your orbs on gaining INC and LUC because you are a mage, so good luck fending for yourself without spells and no good stats, Praying to god that you find another spell book.\n\nSome tips\nThe Potions that the orcs carry are usually helpful, such as a health or invisibilty potion, while the ones you find on the floor are usually poison or fire.\n\nIf you want to figure out what a potion does, throw it at a slime or something weak and watch the affects.\n\nTraps are at least 75% of all my deaths, or responsible for them. Traps will usually one shot you, or get you very close to death, be aware of your surroudings! \n\nIf you want to kill a strong enemy or a lot of strong enimes, throw a rock at a standing torch to knock it over and spill fire everywhere, try not to burn yourself though, this game is very unforgiving.\n\nA potato in a bottle of water dropped on top of fire is pretty delicious!\n\nits always nice to have a rock or bone in your inventory slot, it comes in handy when hitting switches, throwing things at enimies, or activating a trap.\n\n\n\nListen, This game is a lot of fun, irritating and aggrovating, but fun. I woudn't have bought it if i knew, but since i have it i might as well play it... This game is NOT for casuals\n\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1489946311, "timestamp_updated": 1489946311, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.329017", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30566867": {"recommendationid": "30566867", "author": {"steamid": "76561198331338286", "num_games_owned": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 978, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512475851}, "language": "french", "review": "C'est le premier rogue like \u00e0 carte al\u00e9atoire que je trouve jouable.

It's incredible. It seems on the surface like it might be fairly simple and straight-forward, but that is not the case at all. It's one of those games that is deceptively deep, and steeped in possibility.\n\nWhat do I mean by that? Well let me give you an example:\nI came upon a goblin who surprised me, and I was at low health with a damaged weapon. I ran out of the hallway into the room I had just been in. I didn't have many options so I used a spell called \"Push\" (basically a jedi force push) to buy myself some time. The spell actually picked up a ball of slime off the floor and flung it in his face, blinding him and giving me the upper hand. I quickly took my opportunity and slew him. As I picked up his corpse to loot it, what I failed to notice is that the potion he was holding had rolled onto the nearby campfire. It vaporized into the room, and I freaked out trying to get away. It turned out to be a potion of might, so it actually helped me. Or it would have if I hadn't been freaking out and ran into the spike pit in the other corner of the room. DED.\n\nThere are so many random, totally one-of-a-kind moments in this game that you can run into, or even consciously create. It baffles the mind. If you see a treasure chest at the bottom of a pirhana-filled pond, and you happen to have the Chain Lightning spell, you can electrocute the entire pool and have the spoils. Or throw in a skeleton as a distraction and hope you can swim down and get your loot before they pick it clean.\n\nIt has a well-balanced leveling system, interesting weapon enchantments, dastardly traps...I mean, you can even bake potatoes, or put hot sauce on a goblin corpse you're about to eat to get a better benefit out of it. It balances action, exploration, tactics and all-around cute shit very well.\n\nNot only that, but it has local co-op which absolutely does not disappoint. My girlfriend isn't much of a gamer, but we've been jamming this game together, and she loves it too, even though most of what we do is get ourselves (and each other) killed.\n\nAnd it's only in Alpha!

The controls are very tight and comfortable in my opinion (360 controller). At its current state it has three classes (more classes are planned) but I think the wizard/spell caster class is very underpowered. It has a good soundtrack, especially the title screen song. The game has really good humour and it hits me well. I do wish that there was more variety in the scenery and enemies in the first 3 floors, because from what I can tell it has a really large learning curve/ time sink to get consistently good. So I spend a lot of time fighting the same enemies in the same environments. All I think it needs is the format that Towerclimb has which a few different biomes randomized at the start with challenge and prize paths you can optionally take to mix things up or power you enough to get further than just skill allows.

That being said, in its current state, it is way too buggy, and not showing any sign of solid promise for a full release (so is the blight of 99% of all EA games). The last major content addition was over a year ago, and I am still experiencing the same bugs that I had when I played the game even earlier than that (I had a non-Steam copy for those who are curious).\n\nMost of the deaths I experience in this game are either unfair or just due to glitches, be it my head tapping a wall next to me when I am going up an elevaotr (instant death) or the walls around me crushing me from some instant spawn due to a boss battle (no indication as to where these walls spawn, they just kill you if you are near them).\n\nAnd even past the cheap deaths (which are plenty, 90% of the deaths I experience are total shit), the dev doesn't pay his fans any justice. No real feed on the games progress is ever given, and you never really know when development is on track or where in the hell it is. Just a simple tweet or announcement on how the next patch is going, but he can't even be bothered to read or respond to the forum posts. Furthermore, it is usually a bad sign when a dev is going to conventions and stuff, when he has an EA game that isn't even remotely done yet.\n\nSo all in all, I don't recommend this game at the

I'd wait for sale or give it a little while to advance in development, but it can provide a pretty decent amount of fun and challenge at the moment.\n\nHas 3 classes to choose from, akin to Warrior, Rogue, and Mage, but with more charming and stylized design ideas, the game has more planned to come in the future. When starting the game you get to pick from one of those 3 classes, and it will present you with a few randomly generated characters with their respective names, gender, physical features, traits/skills, stats, and equipment. Traits can be positive or negative. You can reroll the characters you get by going back to class selection and selecting again. The problem with this is being forced to reroll for something you're going to get anyways, same problem I had with a NIS game called Soul Nomad, where you would reroll for grids for your units to be placed in, and some were straight-up better than others, so you'd spend a lot of time rerolling to get the better ones. I understand this decision for the \"daily challenge\" mode, where you kinda just use the hand you're dealt, but otherwise? Meh.\nTraits and character creation could use some polishing, my gripe is having to spend ANY amount of time rerolling so I don't get \"unstable caster\" on my casters, or clumsy on... anyone, really. Unstable caster makes your spells backfire or work incorrectly, which... why would you want this on a caster? Clumsy is a chance for you to get fucked over while in combat or tripping over ignorable items in the floor, which also results in you falling down pits or dying to a charging enemy. There's no skill or fairness involved in these kind of things in my opinion, just a random chance for something bad to happen. Other than these the game has felt challenging in fair and fun ways to me. To clarify, I really, really don't mind a character with worse gear or lower stats, but when the traits have a big chance of seriously screwing you up, that's a no for me.\nUnlockable customization could be a nice thing, or \"locks\" like what elona uses during character creation so starting stats can't all be random. Personally I'd enjoy being able to pick the gender of my characters, since it doesn't impact gameplay meaningfully.\nGame is a little rough around the edges currently, especially the UI. It randomly turns off my x360 controller and sometimes dpad inputs are really wonky in menus, like straight-up not letting me do basic commands until I use the analog stick instead. Trying to pick from items lying on the ground in the same general space is a massive pain as you just have to walk over them and hope the UI will prompt the right item for you.\n\nOverall it's pretty solid, there's some fun interaction with items, spells, and environments, but needs some more polishing before I can recommend it wholeheartedly.", "timestamp_created": 1472953133, "timestamp_updated": 1472954339, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.474140", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25244962": {"recommendationid": "25244962", "author": {"steamid": "76561198108011255", "num_games_owned": 121, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1860, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512409444}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing game, albeit a little bit hard.\nThis is another of those 2d rougelike dungeon crawler but here is the selling point:\nThe combinations!

That being said I love this game and it's a solid indie game. I can't get enough of it and it's consuming my life. I love it's randomness, it's crazy moments where I walk into a room and enemies are on fire already, chasing a rat and suddenly 5 giant weights fall from the sky and kill them all.\n\nI love being able to outwit enemies. I love being able to create some crazy build and becoming unstoppable only to not notice I'm stuck in poison, get knocked down to 1 HP and have a turret fire at a bat or somthing and miss, hit a pillar and fall down onto me, killing me.\n\nIt's crazy. It's insane.

This is the 'rogue-like' I've been looking for. So many games state they're 'rogue-like' just because they have perma-death and pixel graphics. This is one, if not the most, truly 'rogue-like' experiences I've ever had in a game. So many examples of this and I\"ve only been playing 3 hours! These enemies don't simply come at you and attack in a predictable pattern. You can throw a certain potion at an enemy, they burst into flames, look for a pool of water, jump in, put the flames out, and come after you. I've had enemies, after getting hit, run off screen, grab some buddies and come after me. I've seen them realize I'm winning and run out of the dungeon completely, etc., etc. The enemy AI is like nothing I've ever experienced in a game of this type - They dodge, hide, go to another room, wait for you to turn your back or expose a vulnerability, and pounce on you, etc, etc. I'm going on and on, but this game is truly a mind-blowing experience. I've started a fire, threw a potion in that then creates a gas which then made me ethereal. I've done the same and been poisoned on other runs. Fish jump out of the water if you stand too close. I've knocked enemies into the piranhas, and they get stripped to the bone just like they'd do to me, and on and on. The environments are just as dynamic as the enemies. You can even craft food!  I feel like I've only just barely scratched the surface with this game, and there's so much unexpected in literally every run. Death is frequent (sometimes in just a few seconds), but I just made it to level 3 and it felt like a huge accomplishment for me. Death is never not follwed by laughter. No matter how many times I've died, I've never rage-quit. It's one of those magical games that forces you to do 'just one more run!' You could play this game for hours or for 15 minutes and have a blast regardless. The controls are very tight, the graphics are great and with every single run, keeps me on my toes and keeps me guessing. This game is an absolute pleasure and a total blast!

Honestly there is no other game like it and it seems so crazy that its in alpha and only made by one guy. The game is beautiful graphically and the sounds are amazing. I would easily spend 30 bucks to play this game after alpha and I would be surprised if the Developer didn't price it up considering how he is by himself making the game. That brings me to a few other points. He fixes bugs and other issues by himself which means it takes awhile to implement new things, as of now there is only 3 classes which it looks like maybe 3 more to come (I honestly hope its even more since the look has been changed it looks like they can add an infinite amount of classes). The maps are all randomly generated and beautiful at that. The developer has added more items and mechanics to the game since the start and I have to say its always for the better even the healing which was reduced slightly still functions as planned. I hope the developer adds co-op soon because as soon as he does I am positive more people will buy this game to play with friends. It is one of my favorite games to play and I hope they continue to impress the community. \n\nThis section of my review will be for suggestions because maybe with enough votes the dev will see it.\n\nClasses:\n\nAssassin Class: AKA Rebel this class should allow the user to start off with a random potion or maybe a teleportation scroll, or even a smoke bomb (new item idea). It should favor Daggers and Swords and Probably hate heavy weapons such as hammers. The taunt should be a small damage boost with backstabs and slightly faster running or quiets the loud drawback for a few seconds.\n\nHunter Class: AKA Strategist this class should allow the user to start with a Bow (new item idea) or Trap (new item idea). It will favor Bows and traps and will more likely hate all melee type weapons except daggers. The Taunt should be the Hunter being able to locate gas traps and spikes. \n\nHealer/Potion Class: AKA Alchemist this class should be able to start with a healing spell or random potion. It will have a higher chance to favor no item. The taunt will allow the user to combine the eaten items (with a minimum of 4) into a random potion, and it will automatically know what that potion is. This will be a huge helping class for Multiplayer if it is ever implented. \n\nItems: \n\nSmoke Bomb: Creates a small cloud of randomly colored smoke which makes enemies stop chasing you and start coughing. Lasts for 2 seconds. It would be cool if the color of the smoke stains the walls and floor and items like desks.\n\nBow: This would be a class item that only shoots forward and it has a charge time of 2 seconds to do full damage based off your Strength. It would be neat to be able to obtain certain arrows through barrels and enemies. Maybe a bouncy arrow or fire arrow. This item would be permanent much like a melee item.\n\nTraps: This would be an item that you can place to try and lure enemies to you, may be cool with bully. Basically it would deal damage and rip a limb off the enemy who walks through it. I would assume this isn't a permanent item and much more like a 2 uses item. Maybe you would be able to add effects to them as well. Such as a fire trap, gas trap, poison trap, and spike trap?\n\nAnyway yeah just some small suggestions that I think would be neat to add.", "timestamp_created": 1467513381, "timestamp_updated":

Though development has been understandably slow, it has been a fun, rewarding, engrossing game every step of the way, each new build.\n\nCatacomb Kids occupies an area in the platforming roguelike spectrum somewhere between the immediacy of Spelunky and the resource-management-heavy Vagante. You have class skills, ability points, affinities and faults. You can carry only what you can wear, plus two exta handheld items. You can learn spells and new skills as you progress, and there are quite a few interesting builds. Any time I force myself to use a skill or spell I'd previously written off as useless I find a way to make it work, opening up an interesting new playstyle potential.\n\nClose combat is quite deep, and the AI devious. You have to manage action warmups and cooldowns for a variety of weapons, dodge rolls with invulnerable frames, and weapon clashes. That's before magic, thrown items, or extra abilities that let you parry, disarm, grapple, or even pick up and throw enemies.\n\nCatacomb Kids also boasts incredible emergent gameplay, featuring some fascinating and sometimes unexpected interactions. Most items, enemies, and materials can be heated, frozen, wet, crushed, gooped, crushed, dismembered, and who knows what else. Enemy groups also don't get along with each other, leading you to stumble into an existing squabble between Byats and Grumbuls, or losing the aggro of a Skeleton when you knock a few otherwise complacent green slimes at it.\n\nThis game is worth it.

There isn't one to begin with, and I get thats its a roguelike but playing this game isn't all that quick. It takes a while to build up characters and well sometimes I don't have the time. I not saying make a save system that allows you to restart after you die but merely save my game so I don't lose my character in the middle of a run. 8/10 Would die to Frost potion again.", "timestamp_created": 1457642235, "timestamp_updated": 1457642235, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "21599254": {"recommendationid": "21599254", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034019268", "num_games_owned": 303, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 831, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487386545}, "language": "english", "review": "Death 1: green slime\nDeath 2: green slime\nDeath 3: burning green slime\nDeath 4: purple slime\nDeath 5: spikes\nDeath 6: ricocheting bottle of lava that i didnt know existed until i used trajectory into lava and hit hit a green slime on its way back to me killing us both... fml XD\nDeath 7: still laughing about death 6, while getting murdered by a green slime\nDeath 8: grumble\n\nThis game will test your resolve and make you go insane if you let it. but kleep in mind 99% of the deaths you inevitably will recieve will still be as funny as your first time playing and they will be YOUR FAULT, you were too slow to react, jumped a tad bit too far/late drank the wrong potion ect.

Each kid you play as has different weapons, stats, and spells and they'll feel and look different,as an example, there isnt just one axe style or look, each weapon has a variation and each variation still has more randomized stats.

There is also a nice amount of detail like Grumbuls hunting smaller creatures and being able to knock over torches in the background to set things on fire. \n\nThe mechanics are fantastic and things like climbing and jumping feel responsive and fluid. Combat is nice and entertaining with things like shield blocking, grappling and using the environment to your advantage. Everything \"feels\" just right and it's a joy to jump and run and stab and so on and so forth.\n\nSo far it is a bit lacking in content though. Only one \"area\", 3 classes and a handful of enemies are present. So if you buy this game, know that this is but a little piece of the final product.

Whether it's pure action or tactical gameplay, Catacomb Kids is here to deliver it well. As you venture forth through multiple procedurally generated levels, you'll find yourself facing the brutal challenges of traps, relentless enemies, poisonous mushrooms, and.. fire ( surprisingly my worst enemy in this game ). You will spend your time exploring and scavenging for better equipment to make your character stronger. And... if you choose to.. you can eat stuff to gain beneficial stats for your character. See that annoying bat fluttering about above your head? You can eat that. See that weird gooey slime making its way across the ceiling? You can eat that. See that ugly goblin that tried to kill you a few seconds ago that's also lying on the ground right now because you decapitated his head? You can eat that. Oh, what's that? You lost your leg? Well, you can fuckin eat it OR you can smolder it with a torch and attach it back on as sort of a peg leg. You're a monster in this game if you choose to be, and I love it.\n\nThe enjoyment I get from playing this game is the interactive elements of the environment around you. This means that there are multiple ways of dealing with certain situations. In example, if you see an angry goblin rushing at you with a weapon at hand, what would be your first instinct? You have options. Fight him head-on. Run away and lure him into a trap. Pounce him and continously bash his head in with a rock or any other small, portable object. Pick him up, throw him into a pool of piranhas and watch him get shred to pieces. Goomba stomp him. Cast a spell that can either manipulate the situation to give you a higher advantage or completely obliterate him. Dip your weapon in a fire potion and burn him to death with your mighty weapon blows of destruction. Throw a slimeball in his face to blind him, then stand back as he swings his weapon around at nothing like an idiot ( Then kill him, of course ). This is just ONE of many situations that can occur. There are endless possiblities. \n\nI can't even imagine what this game has to offer at full release. It already shows so much promise in its current state as an early access game.\n\nIs it worth the $16? For me, personally, YES. I'm having a blast with this game.

de madeira esburacadas, grandes buracos de onde saem os morcegos , estatuas que s\u00e3o fontes de agua , monumentos , paredes emtijoladas , covis de grumbuls , salas de rituais , \u00e9 bem bonito\n\no som do jogo \u00e9 muito detalhado , como fogo , agua , piranhas batendo os dentes , sons vareados de cal\u00e7ados , po\u00e7\u00f5es , feiti\u00e7os ... a trilha sonora \u00e9 vareada e muito bem ambientada . o tema medieval das trilhas sonoras quase me passou despercebido , porem foi uma otima jogada\n\n\u00e1 uma lista vastas de equipamentos , estou jogando a 1 ano e at\u00e9 hoje eu descubro coisas novas . a todo tipo de inimigo nesse alpha , grumbuls de fogo (imunes a fogo) , grumbuls invenenadores , assasinos saqueadores , esqueletos , guerreitos mortos vivos , outras crian\u00e7as , ja que o nome do jogo \u00e9 catacomb kids (d\u00e3)\n\ne por ultimo e n\u00e3o \"menos melhor\":\n\no jogo \u00e9 repleto de minimos detalhes e intera\u00e7\u00f5es , voce pode jogar uma batata em um grumbul e ele vai pegar a batata e estar vulneravel por alguns milesimos , esquentar alimentos em fogeiras , fazer bomba caseira , pode cegar inimigos com gosmas , jogar tochas para iluminar o local ou incendiar outros inimigos , manipular armadilhas ao seu favor , enfim , se eu fosse contar todas as possibilidades , a analise nem seria sobre o jogo , mas sobre todas elas\n\n\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [th]jogabilidade[/th]\n        [th]10,0[/th]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]som[/td]\n        [td]9,0[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]design[/td]\n

You're better off just running for the exit and ignoring everything on the level. Certain enemies like bats have an absurdly large amount of health. There's no quickrestart option, so you're stuck returning to the main menu and rechoosing your character. If you could replay the last dead character through a quick restart the game would be way less annoying. Killing enemies is like trying to thread a needle with a twizler while drunk. The autograb function makes it near impossible to go where you want in the heat of the terrible fighting mechanics, you'll be stuck levitating slowly while your character tries to move (can't even tell you how often I've been crushed between the cieling and a ball and chain trap because the game thought I was trying to climb it).

A foe could find a flask of poison you dropped, try it and die. A monkey could steal a bomb from your backpack, run away and explode around the corner, taking an enemy with him. That kind of thing. The game that REALLY popularized this concept was SPELUNKY and, I'm sorry to say, it has also soured games for me since. Many games following SPELUNKY'S example misunderstood this concept and bludgeoned the player with sheer randomness: BROFORCE is the pinnacle of this sorry development. Not a fan.\n\nAnyways, CATACOMB KIDS gets it right. It gets it 100% right. Here's what happened today. I found a flask and ran into three Grumbuls. Even one of these dudes is a challenge - they fight smartly and chug potions to boost their skills - but three were a death sentence. I panicked and threw the potion at them - and I was really lucky because it turned out to be a potion of flames. One of the Grumbuls went down, another jumped into a lake to douse the flames and was eaten by pirahnas. The third attacked and I threw a ball of slimy goo in his face.

There are NO awful bugs and the game runs pretty well. Furthermore the developers are constantly working on the game and they are very close to the  \ncommunity( https://www.reddit.com/r/CatacombKids/new/  ) as you can see here.\n\nThere is enough content to play hundreds of hours or even more and not only because it is a rouge-like. Catacomb Kids has so many possible ways to play. On every new run you can try someting new and so its never get boring. For example there are five different weapon classes(Hammers, Swords, Daggers, Spears, Axes) and each weapon class splits into six differnt typs. And those are just the weapons, there are also magic, armor, skills for each weapon class and so on. This game can be incomprehensibly complex, but this is the point why Catacomb Kids makes so much fun! Though you have to invest some time to understand everything and get into. And yes the game is really hard and you will fail at the beginning however its a part of the game and you will love it. \nThe graphics are functional that is clear. But the Pixelart has its charm and the game looks in his own way very beautiful.\n\nSo just buy this piece of software and have fun!

It's not uncommon to roll away from an enemy and straight onto some spikes within seconds of starting the game.\n\nBut it's *fun*. It's like Spelunky (you HAVE played Spelunky, haven't you?) except with some traditional action RPG elements like classes, equipment, skills and attributes, and it makes for lots of intriguing possibilities.\n\nMaybe you play as a Wanderer, and you pick up the first Grumbul corpse you find, hold down V to track the Grumbuls. You find the leveling orb and level up Intelligence and choose Trajectory. You aim the first mystery potion you have at a pair of Grumbuls, but it's a potion of might! Fortunately, you also knocked over a sconce and set the floor on fire. One of them makes a beeline for you, so you run like mad. Fortunately, you chose Boots of Gossamer and you don't trip the pressure plate, but the Grumbul does... but not slow enough to get caught by it. It hits you for two health out of your four and sets you on fire. You roll into water to put the fire out and then jump out of the water, but not before a pissed-off fishana jumps out of the water and takes your final health point.\n\nMaybe you play as a poet, and you chance it with three health. You learn the Double Jump spell (it's a spell in this game!) and find another Magic In Motion spellbook. You hold C to learn that one, too, but click on the middle, which gives you the floating book skill \"Otherblink\". You get the leveling orb and choose Strength with the skill Heavy Lifting, which lets you lift boulders around, one of the more satisfying ways of killing enemies. You accidentally come across three Grumbuls and hightail it out of there, only to end up in a chamber with lava on the bottom and little room to maneuver. You hit V a few times as your pursuers get closer and it Otherblinks two of them into the lava. You deliberately click a trap and a weight comes smashing down, and you jump up and ride up, but make sure to jump out before you're flattened. You hunt and consume five green goos and overheal for three points but get poisoned by mushroom gas. You hightail it to the exit door, snapping a line which fills the area with flammable gas and lights it. You barely avoid it, but out of curiosity, hang around in the gas caused by another potion that got too got and evaporated. Ugh! Getting zapped! But since it's from a gas, it doesn't last as long. Wow, there's the door. I actually made it to level 2 this time?\n\nPart of the fun is that it's *really* hard to tank this game. You can often win against the occasional Grumbul, but you have to be really strategic if you want to survive. The Grumbuls in later levels are often special - fire-resistant, poison-spewing or extra strong and you might want to really plan out your attack.\n\nEven in the character creation, you have to compromise a great deal. If you're willing to take on negative traits such as clumsiness, bad swimmer, loud, messy eater or hates <weapon type>, you can get more health and magic, but the negatives can really trip you up. Choosing a character with a damaged weapon can do the same, but you had better find a good weapon soon - some damaged starter weapons have difficulty even hurting goos.\n\nSome elements of the game are just a joy. There's something satisfying about shaking a chest open instead of the usual game mechanic of opening the lid. Throwing dead Grumbuls into the water will totally distract the fish. Throwing a dead slime at a Grumbul will splat and cover its eyes for a couple of [precious] seconds. Some lifeforms in the dungeon piss each other off and you can use this to your advantage, especially later in the game.\n\nReally looking forward to more development. It takes quite a while between releases, it seems, but they are jam-packed with stuff.\n\nI hope they make a class that's better with traps, even if there are other compromises, because sometimes, I need a break from dying on spikes :)\n\n(Though note: if you choose Defense twice, you can choose a trait that prevents one-shot kills if your health is >75%.

It's something that sets them apart from games like Rogue Legacy, that have the kind of difficulty roguelike fans look for, and an affectation of 'nintendo hard' platformers that hit people right in the nostalgia, but have no real substance behind them. \n\nI could tell right away that the developers of Catacomb Kids were not only familiar with more venerable roguelikes, but that they had a keen insight into what makes them so captivating. I often find myself thinking my way around a problem much like I would in Nethack or DCSS, where I'd tally my resources and make calculated decisions that would often fail spectacularly. My poor catacomb kid would die, but with every death I learn a little more about the game's logic.\n\nThis level of complex entity interaction is something I expect from any game calling itself a roguelike (much more so than, say, the overzealous expectation of an ASCII interface), even to an extent that I believe it's a cornerstone of the genre. \n\nCatacomb Kids does not claim an indulgence of weapon types, monsters, or classes for the player. Instead, they have created a meaningful and treacherous arena for players who want a game that demands that they think tactically and, most importantly, learn from their mistakes.",

Hard as hell. Permadeath dungeon crawler platforming game with many ways to approach situations and tons of ways to die. You will die a lot, but it makes succeeding that much more rewarding. \n\nYou begin by selecting one of three (at the moment, only three) classes and then you pick a character from a randomly selected group of individuals, each with their own unique abilites, items and weaknesses. Once you enter the catacombs you are free to do whatever you like. You can go back through the door you just entered right from the start or you can rush the door to the next floor. However the smart way to play would be to explore the area and grab the \"orb of leveling\" which can be found on each floor as that is the only way to level your character.\n\nYou can interact with just about everything in the environment, for example: you can pick up a rock and sneak up on an orc standing near a torch, throw the rock at the torch, knocking it over and setting the orc up in flames. You can throw a potion at an enemy or even in a fire near an enemy causing the potion to break and fill the area with whatever effect it holds. In one particular game I alerted an orc enemy by making too much noise. He ran over to me and severed one of my arms. I defeated him and then was able to pick up my severed arm and eat it. I soon after walked into a trap which triggered a burst of flames that killed me. \n\nThe game takes a great deal of patience and a decent amount of skill, or maybe rather familiarity with the game itself in order to progress through the catacombs. After 4 hours of playing I have yet to see the 3rd floor, although I can't play for more than an hour at a time without taking a break, but that's just me. If there was any reason not to play this game it would be because it is too hard.

In Spelunky, you could gear up with a shotgun and take out your foe from distance, or equip a jetpack to hover over your insurmountable foes, or use bombs to hack your way through. This game? No, you will often have to go out on a limb(of getting insta-killed) and get your hands dirty.\n\nAlso, although it's interactive, you find it hard to find out what every objects, items do. Neither will you harness all those function in reality(You end up throwing potions only at best. I dunno how much other players make out of what they found. At least this is the case of mine & one famous youtuber who played this game for a while).\n \nAnd the update speed...I simply hope it doesn't share the fate of Starbound :/\n\nEDIT: It's still early access.

You'd think this would come after finally defeating him -- but I still haven't. I just had my best chance and blew it, and it was truly awesome. I'm not great at platformers at all, but this game is difficult. Yet, unlike, say, Dark Souls (not really a platformer -- I know, shhhh), it always feels fair. Not at first, no. At first it's going to feel like you're bouncing down a flight of stairs, and once he adds stairs you probably will. But eventually you'll understand the various complexities of what makes a good build and how to navigate the world without dying. How to navigate quickly, eventually. And how to find, after hours and hours, the thing that's truly exciting about this game. That shot of adrenaline. \n\nI might play a 20 minute session or two hours. For instance, I spent more time writing this than I did on the run that inspired me to write this. But it's not a casual game in the slightest. It's unforgiving. \n\nI can't wait to see what classes he adds next and what other weird systems he'll introduce. I haven't felt that way about an EA game in a while.

I also play a lot of games and cycle through them pretty quickly. I have this sitting firmly atop my \"Perpetually Playing\" category.\n\nIt's dope. I feel cool playing it even though I suck at it.

At this stage in the game's development the quality of the platforming alone is enough to warrant the $15 for me, but should you need more convincing, read on by all means!\n\nThe movement is tight and responsive, such that very few things feel unfair once you've mastered the controls (one exception is the \"ledge-grab\" mechanic which is a tad unpredictable at times, causing you to stick between two \"climbable\" edges--say a ladder on one side and a ledge on the other--when trying to make a speedy escape from a gas trap or otherwise, but prior knowledge makes this avoidable, if still a bit trying). This transparency and responsiveness is paramount to (at least my) enjoyment of the game given the its punishing nature. At this point in development there are two \"finished\" classes (still subject to change, of course) and a third is scheduled to be released with an update in the near future.\n\nDespite the protracted development schedule it becomes increasingly clear with each \"monthly\" update that the game is either a labor of love--or an obsession (but hey, what's the difference, amirite?!)--for the developers. This comes through in spades when you've played enough to consistently get beyond the first floor or so. Another nice thing is the community and the ways that the developers chose to allow access and input therein. Between reddit, irc, and weekly development streams, the team has done a great job meting out content without giving too much away or over promising. Overall I'm as excited now as I was when I supported the Kickstarter a year ago and that in itself is an achievement for the dev team. There is great momentum and it feels as if the nice things about this game are only improving throughout the cycle.\n\nI will add more to this as features and content are added, but I would like to say publicly that the thing I am MOST looking forward to is couch co-op. The amount of strategy, thought, and awareness required for success in a single player run is high, but the reward is commensurate in my estimation. I can only imagine and I fully expect that co-op play will similarly increase the stakes as well as the payoff.", "timestamp_created": 1434574417, "timestamp_updated": 1434574417, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.563803", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "16349708": {"recommendationid": "16349708", "author": {"steamid": "76561198182151634", "num_games_owned": 40, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 800, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1455197180}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uce74\ud0c0\ucf64 \ud0a4\uc988! \uc644\ubcbd\ud55c \ub85c\uadf8\ub77c\uc774\ud06c\uc911 \ud558\ub098\ub77c\uace0 \uc0dd\uac01\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4\n\uc2a4\ud0ac\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud558\uace0 \uc801\uc808\ud55c \ub09c\uc774\ub3c4\uc758 \ucee8\ud2b8\ub864\ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc774 \uc874\uc7ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4\n\uc721\uc131\ub3c4 \ub2e4\uc591\ud558\uac8c \ud560\uc218 \uc788\uad6c\uc694!", "timestamp_created": 1434181047, "timestamp_updated": 1434181047, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "16265534": {"recommendationid": "16265534", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074498743", "num_games_owned": 96, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 3009, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485029256}, "language": "english", "review": "An incredible game that challenges players to think outside the box, I've been playing this game for hours on end but I'm still discovering new things every playthrough!", "timestamp_created": 1433794286, "timestamp_updated": 1486323747, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "16237588": {"recommendationid": "16237588", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040644163", "num_games_owned": 206, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2961, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512972157}, "language": "english", "review": "\n-Pros-\n-Soft, gentle learning curve (and by that, I mean \"no matter what you learn, your deaths are always comfortably attributed to your own folly, rather than the mechanics.\")\n-Tight mechanics, I've only found a few issues with the procedural generation.

I've been slimed, decapitated, torn to shreds, burnt, poisoned, drowned, poisoned and drowned at the same time, burned to death with my own spells, burned to death after knocking over a torch, burned to death after incenerating a goblin, only to have him start me on fire, and many more.\n\nFastest death so far? 3 seconds after spawning (yep, my fault). Longest lived character? Probably 40 minutes and I was DAMN PROUD!!\n\nHard as it is, it's totally fair. Each of my deaths was due to inexperience, rushing in without looking, panicking and mashing the attack button instead of timing it, mis-timing a jump, or (most frequently) losing a fight due to poor strategy or timing. The battles can be pretty epic, especially once your skill level rises and you can be more creative with your combat choices. Early on you'll be happy you lived at all.\n\nThere's something about the way permadeath is done in this game that makes it fun and very compelling. Part of this might be due to the fact it's only in Alpha 0.0.9 and is extraordinarily fast & responsive, and impressively bug-free for such an early version.\n\nThere are a couple issues I'd like to see fixed. The jump mechanic can be a little wonky. If you jump into a wall with a ladder on it, you'll stick to wherever you hit on the wall as long as (a) there's a ladder there, and (b) you're still pushing left or right on your controller. However, if you roll the controller UP as you reach the wall (a natural movement, since you'll be wanting to go up the moment you get there), then you will not stick to the wall and instead fall back to the ground.\n\nLastly, a wired XBOX controller makes a HUGE difference -- it's much easier than the keyboard for this game -- but the controller bindings don't work for OSX. I ended up buying ControllerMate for OSX and then programming it to match the KBD1 key bindings.  The game doesn't seem to actually recognize the controller; it works because ControllerMate converts each button press to an equivalent key binding.\n\nOverall, if you like dungeon crawlers of any type, this may end up being your favorite.", "timestamp_created": 1431066293, "timestamp_updated": 1431067564, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.626147", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "15735032": {"recommendationid": "15735032", "author": {"steamid": "76561198127153980", "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2260, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507712801}, "language": "schinese", "review": "procedurally generated platformer\u5df2\u505c\u6b62\u5de5\u4f5c", "timestamp_created": 1431053498, "timestamp_updated": 1431053498, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.474684", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "15502279": {"recommendationid": "15502279", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047221877", "num_games_owned": 683, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 996, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483437326}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u6b7b\u306b\u30b2\u30fc\u30ed\u30fc\u30b0\u30e9\u30a4\u30af\u306a\u30a2\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3067\u3059\u3002\n\u69cd\u3001\u5263\u3001\u30cf\u30f3\u30de\u30fc\u3001\u65a7\u3001\u30c0\u30ac\u30fc\u3001\u9b54\u6cd5\u3068\u591a\u304f\u306e\u6b66\u5668\u3092\u64cd\u308a\u306a\u304c\u3089\u4e0b\u5c64\u307e\u3067\u6f5c\u3063\u3066\u3044\u304f\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3067\u3059\n\u3002\u5012\u3057\u305f\u6575\u306f\u6b7b\u4f53\u304c\u6b8b\u308c\u3070\u98df\u3079\u308c\u307e\u3059\u3002\uff15\u5339\u98df\u3079\u305f\u3089HP\u56de\u5fa9\u3002\n\u30ad\u30e3\u30e9\u6bce\u306b\u7279\u5fb4\u304c\u3042\u308a\u3001\u80c3\u304c\u5f31\u304b\u3063\u305f\u308a\u3068\u9762\u767d\u3044\u3002\n\u30ea\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u6027\u3042\u3063\u3066\u826f\u3044\u3002\n\u78ba\u304b\u3053\u308c\u30a2\u30fc\u30ea\u30fc\u30a2\u30af\u30bb\u30b9\u3060\u3063\u305f\u3068\u601d\u3044\u307e\u3059\u304c\u3001\u666e\u901a\u306b\u9762\u767d\u3044\u3067\u3059\u306d\u3002\u4eca\u8cb7\u3063\u3066\u3082\u5341\u5206\u697d\u3057\u3081\u307e\u3059\uff01\n\u4e00\u65e5\u4e00\u56de\u3084\u308b\u304b\uff01\u3068\u3044\u3046\u6c17\u6301\u3061\u306b\u306a\u308c\u308b\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3067\u3059\u3002\n\u30de\u30be\u306a\u65b9\u306b\u306f\u4e00\u62bc\u3057\u306e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3067\u3059\u3002\u672a\u9451\u5b9a\u30dd\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u98f2\u3093\u3060\u3089\u71c3\u3048\u3066\u70ba\u3059\u8853\u3082\u306a\u304f\u6b7b\u3093\u3058\u3083\u3046\u3068\u304b\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u304b\u3089\u306d\uff01\n\u4eca\u30a4\u30c1\u30aa\u30b7\u3067\u3059\uff01\u82f1\u8a9e\u308f\u304b\u3093\u306a\u304f\u3066\u3082\u51fa\u6765\u307e\u3059\u3088\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1429788549, "timestamp_updated": 1429788549, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505888", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "15498308": {"recommendationid": "15498308", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118156545", "num_games_owned": 93, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 11260, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 616, "last_played": 1514065018}, "language": "english", "review": "Is gud.

If you mess up just a little bit in this game, it punches you in the gut and kicks you in the teeth. Randomly generated catacombs and randomly made characters make the game infinitely fun. Right now Catacomb Kids is in Early Access, but there is tons on different variants in the game. (Weapons, shields, armor, potions, catacombs layouts, and different types of magic.) Right now there is only two classes with more on the way in future updates. Along with all the single player features, there is a verses mode with eight different arenas, but there is only local co-op and verses an AI. The only bad thing that I can say about this game is that there is no setting for changing the difficulty. \n [h1] Pros              [/h1]      \n[list]      \n    [*]Versus mode\n    [*]Randomized catacombs\n    [*]Randomized playable character \n    [*]No game breaking glitches\n    [*]Great controller support\n    [*]No performance issues \n   \n [/list]      \n      \n[h1] Cons             [/h1]      \n[list]      \n    [*]Can be too hard for some\n    [*]Very unforgiving\n    [*]Barely any display options\n\n [/list]      \n    \n[h1]  Conclusion                [/h1]    \n\tCatacomb Kids is a brutally fun roguelike game, but it could be too hard for some people. It really needs a difficulty setting.  Catacomb Kids has almost unlimited replay value because it has randomly generated playable characters and catacombs. In the end, Catacomb Kids is 100% worth a buy even in Early Access, and there is more content on its way to make this game worth it even more.\n\n[h1]  Video Review                [/h1]    \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohZhqOxoIm0\n-HiPFiRED  \n\n\n[i] If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Original_Curators_Group#curation]Follow Original Curator Group[/url][/i]\n\n[i]Check out the Original Network Groups.

The ability to start and play the game different every run through makes it get old incredibly slowly, and the high difficulty means that its always challenging. Text really isn't a great way to describe all the nuances and mechanics in the game, and it's actually more fun to figure them out for yourself. With all these great things in mind there are two major complaints I have:\n1. It's Early Access\nEarly Access games are always risky, and are often buggy. In this case there are a great many parts of the game that just straight up aren't implemented yet. It's still incredibly fun, but once you level your stats to a certain point, the unique bonuses that are supposed to come with them just aren't implemented yet. In addition to this I've run across massive frame drops on lower floors(6+), as well as random crashes.  If you are interested in getting involced in the dev process though, this is the only time to buy. If you think you can wait however, by all means wait for the full release.\n\n2.

The procedurally generated dungeons and the statistically random generated characters add endless variety and unique situations. \n\nBrutal and unforgiving. Expect quick deaths if you do not have appropriate reaction speeds; the random generator can create incredibly difficult to traverse trap rooms. One nice touch right from the beginning is the ability to \u201cre-roll\u201d by entering the exit from the previous floor. \n\nThere are too many gameplay elements to explain, but the attention to detail in the weapon-type combat, spell-type combat, and ailments is very refined and filled with variety, even at an Alpha stage. The level up upgrades (Rainbow Orb); if you survive long enough to make it to these coveted items, they will allow you to use attribute upgrades like parrying, free-running, reduced damaged from traps, plus many more expanded as you obtain more orbs.\n\nI am very excited to see the game develop further, to see more classes, and see how refined the gameplay between them comes.

I don't even know where to begin, so I guess I'll start off with the background. I originally torrented an earlier version of this game. Yes, I'm a terrible person, but keep in mind how hard it can be to judge a game from a trailer and some gameplay footage. (Hint: It's bloody difficult.) I did end up purchasing the game though, because I think that the content that they placed for early access was spot-on.\n\nWhat piqued my curiosity from this game is the depth of this game. There's just so many interactions in this game that you simply would not expect a Triple A developing team would do. While I am comparing apples to oranges here, let's say you're in an Open-world RPG and you kill a goblin. Would you have been able to eat the goblin down to the bone? Would you have been able to eat the bones of the goblin and possibly choke on some while losing health? Simply put, you can in Catacomb Kids. For anyone playing, if you kill the purple slime and throw the ball toward the kombold, then it blinds the enemy allowing you to kill it or let it fall into the traps. \n\nIf you are able to, you can bottle a ball of slime and cook it in an open camp fire and drink the slime. Luckily for me, it was sweet. After going through some floors, you can meet a merchant, which sells a number of different equipment. Of course, on the off-chance that you don't have any money from killing the goblins, you can try and kill the merchant him/herself to acquire some loot. It's just these little things, like throwing a goblin into a lake of piranhas to get across without being gnawed to death, that is really fun. \n\nEach time I enter a new floor, shit goes down. Quite literally; there are traps being activated with spikes from a pressure plate, flammable gases dispersed to blow up, mushrooms that extrude nauseous gases, and potions that can either freeze, zap, or burn you to death. Simply put, each floor is pretty unforgiving in its current state of the game, and on the off chance you step on a trap and it teleports you to the bottom of the stage, you better hope that you don't get stepped on like a goomba. Personal experience from that.\n\nGameplay aside, Controls in the game are top-notch, but a bit atypical from what I expected. If you have some experience using a Super Nintendo Emulator like snes9x, then you will get into this game a little bit smoother than others. I wish that the interaction between the ladder and wooden platform would be a little bit smoother, but that's something to wait for later I suppose. \n\nAs for graphics, the game seems to be currently set to a 4:3 aspect ratio resolution, but won't be a huge deal as most of the area will be covered in the shadows. There's no options for AA whatsoever or quality settings, but let me be honest here. You won't need to worry about having 800x600 screen to play this. \n\nMy main gripe at the moment is probably the music. It's not bad in that it doesn't fit, nor is it just poorly composed. I just wish I had an option to turn it off, even moreso it would be nice if the music would be muted when I'm on a different program. Other than that, it's quite soothing.\n\n**\n\nOverall, a lot of people have been saying to wait until the final product comes out. I don't disagree with this statement. I'd hate to be hyped up for a game only to be disappointed and regret investing my money into this team, but this game deserves my money. While I have not been able to get to the end of the game, the content they currently have out right now feels like enough content to be a full-fledged game. Just not for the same price value. \n\nIf anything though, I wish that there would be some more random interactions between heading to the next floor. So far, I've been able to see two different merchants, a kombold encampment, and a narrow dungeon. There would be times between each floor where I get a wad of cash, not knowing when or where I'll spend it. Perhaps a clergyman can heal players, a wizard that can imbue weapons, or a tailor can disguise you as a kombold. They're probably coming in the updates, but here's to hoping that this game will be worth the investment!", "timestamp_created": 1425252629, "timestamp_updated": 1425252629, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.581212", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "14715006": {"recommendationid": "14715006", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070508383", "num_games_owned": 467, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3740, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1463684346}, "language": "english", "review": "EARLY-ACCESS REVIEW\n\nRogue-like platformer at its finest. \n\nCan't really recommend it to newcomers to the Roguelike genre. \n\nIt blends all the best elements from titles such as Spelunky, Rogue Legacy and The Binding of Isaac but adds some complexity in the platforming mechanics. \n\nThe pacing is also very good, balancing the dungeon crawling caution with precise and tactical combat, rewarding plannig and cunning and almost instantly punishing carelessness. \n\nMake no mistake.

Even in the game's current incarnation, the Bully and Poet classes offer an entirely different gameplay experience from the start, and even then, a vividly different experience depending on whether your chosen victi-er, \"hero\" is, say a clumsy, hammer-wielding powerhouse, a sneaky spear specialist, or a notorously messy eater who apparently realy likes daggers.\n\nIt only gets deeper from there, as progressing through each dungeon will yield such familiar roguelike experiences like identifying randomized potions, looting and eating fallen foes (for health and stat bonuses- there is no \"hunger\" stat), and learning your choice of spells from whichever magical tomes happen to be lying about. There is no \"experience,\" either, at least in the traditonal sense, and level-ups are gained through locating a special orb that appears once per floor, meaning exploration takes the place of grinding, and combat is largely optional if you can navigate around it (unless you're interested in pilfering your fallen foes' gear and potions). Mind you, certain kids may possess a stat that enables them to gain experience in the use of specific weapons, but this is a circumstancial occurrence.\n\nEach gained level nets you a point in a stat of your choice, followed by a character perk in that stat's as-of-yet invisible tree of skills, confering special abilities like charging your attacks, aiming your throws, and trampling your foes as you sprint through them, so by and large each of your runs will yield a very different character indeed.\n\nIt's almost sad, then, that for all this depth, each individual run is painfully short- and I use the term \"painfully\" on purpose. Like Spelunky, Catacomb Kids' levels have a single-minded interest in making your hapless dungeonman perish in whatever brutal way it can, sparing no expense in its \"hidden deathtraps\" budget, as well as pitting you against some fairly ruthless foes. Even mundane accidents like bringing electric-enchanted gear into the water, knocking over a torch and lighting the room ablaze, and choking on a bone while dining on your last meal will bring you down swiftly and mercilessly. \n\nThis is at once Catacomb Kids' primary appeal and its weakness- with no time limit for traversing each floor, players are free to take full advantage of the game's depth in fine-tuning their character's stats, equipment and spells to take their best shot at each obstacle as it arises, but ultimately, all that work can be undone in an instant, and more often than not, it will, over and over again, with individual runs rarely lasting more than a scant few minutes until players have built up some considerable skills (at which point, runs will -occasionally- last more than a scant few minutes). \n\nFor those who prefer a quick and visceral experience that doesn't feel like they're losing too much progress with each death, Catacomb Kids is an outstanding coffee-break game, and for those who want to feel like death is lurking around every corner and every moment of continued existence is a victory in itself, Catacomb Kids is a blissful challenge. However, for those who'd prefer to sit for an hour or two delving as deep into the dungeon as they can, Catacomb Kids' death-after-death-after-death gameplay grows stale rather quickly in its current two-class, one-environment state.\n\nStill, to say this game has potential is an understatement- with an original and genuinely fun character progression system that's simple to comprehend and deep enough to play with at length, combat mechanics that are at once bluntly simple to learn yet intricately challenging to master, and a decidedly different character emerging with every run, Catacomb Kids has the makings of everything we love about Spelunky, The Binding of Isaac, FTL, and other genre-defining romps through random peril into the loving arms of near-certain demise.\n\nIf you've got a short attention span and a death wish, this game's definitely worth a play, and likely only getting better from here.", "timestamp_created": 1425239048, "timestamp_updated": 1425239048, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.599867", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "14712614": {"recommendationid": "14712614", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030774454", "num_games_owned": 654, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 953, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505700204}, "language": "english", "review": "+ Procedurally-Generated Dungeons\n+ Procedurally-Generated Characters\n+ Fantasy enemy tropes with decent implementation\n+ Generally avoidable, but clever and brutal traps\n+ Decent Item variety, and some minimal craftingesque item use.\n+ Consumable enemies (Wha...?)\n\n- Only 2 Classes to choose from\n- Price point high for the amount of content currently availible\n- Occasionally clunky controls with keyboard", "timestamp_created": 1425230403, "timestamp_updated": 1425230403, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "14711786": {"recommendationid": "14711786", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052725855", "num_games_owned": 180, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 707, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1438587445}, "language": "english", "review": "Orcs are bitches, rats steal your books and bats throw you onto deadly spikes.\n\n10/10 would die again... and again... and again.", "timestamp_created": 1425227310, "timestamp_updated": 1425227310, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 13, "weighted_vote_score": "0.467237", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "14701706": {"recommendationid": "14701706", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046485497", "num_games_owned": 460, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 979, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 30, "last_played": 1513890079}, "language": "english", "review": "Fair enough I have only 1.1hrs in record and that has been enough to make me enjoy this fun little challenging treasure of a game.

This game is very Rogue-like, and is just as difficult and addicting as you expect.\n_it's just as difficult and addicting as you expect: It's hard to put this game down, every run is different, every run can end in minutes, every run entice you to play more.\n_Looks nice: Very dark, though, so don't expect any treat for the eyes here. But everything looks clean and simple.\n_Relatively bug-free: For a game that's in Alpha, it runs pretty well. Needs more content though.\n\nCons:\n_It's an Alpha right now: So if you HAVE to buy a game only when it's finished, hold off on this. Deffinitely keep it on your radar though.\n_Control scheme could be better: If you don't have a gamepad, don't play this game until you do.

Yes, I realize it's in alpha. That's probably why - it has some rough edges it needs polishing. The devs also realize that by making it early access they are making it available for review. This game does a lot of things really well, and a few things poorly, mostly in design choices of game rules. Let's start with the general discription:\n\nIf you liked Spelunky, and like traditional roguelikes, you'll love this game, even for how frustratingly hard it is. I could almost describe Spelunky as easier than Catacomb Kids (CK). CK takes traditional fantasy elements and a fun yet dark aesthetic and imerses you in a really compelling world where gear, character stats and unidentified potions control the way you play the game. At it's current price, it's a great value. I've already dumped hours into this game.\n\nPROS:\n-Tight, mostly responsive controls make this game a joy to play on a gamepad.\n-Fantastic sound and good music.\n-Megapixel GFX do not seem trite, and are rather well done for a aesthetic that's easy to love.\n-Combat is varied, strategy is deep, builds are different enough to make it interesting.\n-Monsters have fairly solid AI and will force different approaches to each one.\n-Unique character generation means you can continually roll bunches of 6 Kids with different gear and builds until you pick your favorite or try something new.\n-The environment plays a lot into your strategy. Why take on a Grumbel face to face, when you can throw a rock and knock over the torch right next to him?\n\nCONS:\n-Completely useless characters are rolled fairly often. No one is ever going to play a Kid with 2 HP.\n-Humanoid monsters are faster, tougher, more accurate and better at climbing than you are. It's almost like fighting the Spelunky shopkeeper five times on every floor.\n-Once in a while you'll find yourself in places in the dungeon you can't get out of. Probably just an alpha issue.\n-As far as I can tell, there's only one tileset.\n\nThat being said, it's a good game and will probably keep getting better with each update.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1425075308, "timestamp_updated": 1425075308, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "14679835": {"recommendationid": "14679835", "author": {"steamid": "76561198213642676", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 115, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1425076595}, "language": "english", "review": "It's to slow right after you finish the tut.

A trait like \u201cLikes Swords\u201d will give your kid a skill bonus, while a trait like \u201cclumsy\u201d will make them particularly loud when landing. You level up by picking up glowing orbs, or gain magical spells by finding books in the dungeon. It\u2019s fairly easy to get into the rhythm of bounding around and fighting off the denizens of the catacombs. \n\nYou should expect to DIE without warning. This game is incredibly difficult, and it doesn\u2019t care how or when you die. You will enter a level and suddenly you\u2019ve been slain by an orc, or by drinking a potion that happens to burn you alive. Once that occurs, it\u2019s back to square one with a new kid and on to penetrating a new dungeon.\n\nCatacomb kids is definitely not for the squeamish or the impatient. You have to take your take to assure yourself safe passage through the catacombs, and keep your guard up against the terrifying A.I. of the monsters. I\u2019m not going to say the game gets easier when you get higher levels, or gear, because I\u2019ve never had the pleasure of becoming a powerhouse. Catacomb Kids takes pleasure in destroying your hopes and dreams, and more than likely it was your own damn fault.\n\nThis game uses objects in a way that not many others have. You can eat the corpses of the fallen, or throw their goo against a wall to create a sticky trap. You can combine meals to increase your stats, use potions as bombs, and so much more. There is a lot to the system if you live long enough to bask in its glory. \n\nChanges we want/Additions\n\nAttribute deficiencies \u2013 I don\u2019t mind the random skills that give the player some negative factors, but the negatives in stat points is unnecessary. The game is already brutally hard to the point that it seems like an annoyance to lose stat points. Especially when you can enter a catacomb and instantly die from the swipe of an enemy after finding a perfect stat combination for your character. \n\nScenery - Level design is fine for a Rogue Lite, but the levels become a cluster of cobbled rock too quickly. I\u2019d like to see more of a varied look to the areas. If for nothing more than adding a bit more ambience to my continuous deaths. \nPlatforming \u2013 Platforming is a bit too floaty and will lead to tons of accidental deaths. I wish it was more traditional to the 2D spirit of Super Mario and other platformers.\n\nEnemy Difficulty \u2013 When you\u2019re starting out the enemies are much too powerful. You\u2019ll face off against monsters who can take 5 stabs from your weapon, and instantly kill you in one hit. It\u2019s a little too frustrating after dying multiple times in a session, and finally gaining victory and receiving terrible drops. \n\nGearing up \u2013 Since Orcs don\u2019t mess around and can kill you in one hit at the start of the game. The reward for defeating them is usually an awful piece of gear. Since these hard nose battles can end with them simply winning through a battle of attrition, defeating them should feel more rewarding to the player. Mostly because they are pretty adept at breaking through your attacks, and ignoring any top of roll moves you attempt. \n\nCooperative play \u2013 This title features a competitive mode which is cool and all, but I\u2019d love to tackle the dangerous catacombs with a pal. Make it happen!\n\nEarly Access Verdict\n\nAs of Early Access release Catacomb Kids is a brutally hard game that often focuses too hard on frustrating the player. It has a lot going for it in the way of a great item system and interesting combat. The A.I. is murderously powerful and unrelenting, the jumps are a little imprecise, and slaying the enemies isn\u2019t as rewarding as it could be.\nAs of now the game is loads of fun, but feels as if determination isn\u2019t enough to progress through the catacombs. I\u2019d prefer better rewards and investment for tackling death at every corner. It needs a little less Dark Souls and slightly more Dungeon of the Endless at the moment. Let\u2019s see how it shapes up in the next couple of patches!\n", "timestamp_created": 1424920248, "timestamp_updated": 1424920248, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517110", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "14656255": {"recommendationid": "14656255", "author": {"steamid": "76561198151621860", "num_games_owned": 9, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 173, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1428100841}, "language": "english", "review": "Just amazing...

Lot's of random/procedural goodness, stats, classes, weapons, enemies, clever traps, etc. There is even a brilliant implimentation of some basic physics built into the game which you must strategize with and use to your advantage. The aspect that really makes Catacomb Kids stand out are the small details that add comlexity to such a simple platformer, for example, I discovered that when you are weilding a magic dagger of electricity, jumping into a pool of water will (for now obvious reasons) f***k you up. Another neat mechanic is your food pallet. Eating certain combinations of enemy corpses will have varrying effects.

The controls are excellent IF you use a controller (I'll get into that later), the enemies are really fun to fight, the combat feels pretty nice, and mechanics are what makes this game stand out.\n\nAbout the controls, I say it's excellent with a controller because the keyboard is a little weird, however that's just my opinion. It's not unmanagable though, and if you prefer keyboard, go for it!\n\nThe enemies are really interesting, since the grumbles, which are the main enemies, tend to have a lot of health, however are easily predictable. The slimes, goos, and byats are all easy meals, which is great. When you descend deeper, more types of enemies start to appear, making the game a little more difficult each floor.\n\nThe combat is something that made this game really great. With blocking, rolling, parrying, and dismemberment, you have tons of options. There are a variety of melee weapons, aswell as tomes for those who prefer the mage class. Speaking of tomes, the spells in this game are each unique, and are all good in their own way. \n\nThe mechanics, however, are what makes this game what it is. For example, you can heat up a boulder using a fire spell, then push it into water, pick up a poison mushroom and cook it, ridding the poison and making it safe to eat. You can beat enemies to death, create distractions, or activate traps or switches with JUST a rock! You can melt balls of slime or goo, and consume them for health, or use them as weapons against grumbles by blinding them. You can knock over torches and create a fire, burning enemies in the vicinity. Plus how each kid is randomized with different traits just adds more variety to this game!\n\nThat's the end of this review. Keep in mind, this is my first one, and it may not be clear. If you're interested in difficult, but fun rogue-likes, you'll definitely want to pick this game up. 9/10.", "timestamp_created": 1424551062, "timestamp_updated": 1424551062, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510513", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "14580720": {"recommendationid": "14580720", "author": {"steamid": "76561197986488715", "num_games_owned": 180, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 649, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495839753}, "language": "english", "review": "Love this game!

Mix of Spelunky and Darks Souls kind of fits but with even infinitely more weird stuff that happens. It's always the bunch of things that interact in ways you had never thought of making something awesome, just so you can abuse the hell out of it next afterwards. \n\nYou can  and really should experiment. If only your life probably will end quickly otherwhise. And with time you learn tricks that help you tremendously - or kill you because you make some incredibly dumb mistake. Maybe lay a  stone on the pressure plate to trigger the giant weight and go through before it is back up? Maybe stop it by freezing the whole thing in place? Or just use some slime to stick it to the ground? Or maybe you should cut of the rope and throw it around with that one strength boon? Or just let enemies run into it and laugh? Or use it to craft items? Or put bouncy paste under it to throw enemies into the air just before they become pancakes with no chance of escape? Or...\n\nThese lists of interactions can be made for pretty much all gameplay elements. And all these things you can do connect with the other things you can find or make. \nFor the EA part: It's surprisingly polished. At the moment the biggest stuff missing is content past floor  5. There are a bunch of supre scary enemies and variety but if you get past the Twins (yeah, as if, good luck :P) the difficulty slowly decreases because the later stuff isn't there yet. Also, so far only ~20 from the ~60? level up boons are implemented so if you get that far you probably don't want to focus on one stat only. To be fair, you will have to play for a loooong time until you see any of that.\n\nIt is a game of YASD but you keep comming back and back and back. And I don't think there is any game quite like it. \nIn short: It's pretty damn awesome.", "timestamp_created": 1424542906, "timestamp_updated": 1424544254, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5,

This a simply fantastic roguelike platformer. To me, it feels like a combination of Spelunky and Super Smash Bros in a fantasy environment.There are four big selling points I'll discuss below. TL;DR: Very fun, fluid movement, challenging skill based combat, incredible variety of organic environmental interactions, and all play styles are equally supported\n\nThe thing that initially drew me to this game is the way the player moves throughout the environment. It's the smoothest system I've ever played with, and traversing the environment is not just a means to an end, it's a pleasure. The only gripe I have with it is there are occasionally environmental hazards you can't protect against, but they're few and far between. \n\nThis game is extremely difficult, make no mistake. In my opinion, not all of the stats are as balanced as they should be; it's very difficult to survive hits from Grumbuls (humanoid enemy, think orc) early on, and getting good will definitely take practice. That said, the combat is very fun. Killing the enemies is always satisfying, and your deaths feel horribly brutal, but never unfair. The magic system is very intuitive and is useful both in and out of combat.\n\nThe third and perhaps biggest selling point for me is the interactions that happen organically in the world. For instance, within the game there are poisonous mushrooms, boulders, pools of water, and fire magic. Let's look at the interactions possible between these four objects. If there are fish in the water, a mushroom can be thrown in to leak poison into the water and weaken the fish. Using fire magic, you can burn up the mushroom and it's poison cloud to safely pass. Using the same magic, you can super heat the boulder, and hit it into an enemy to deal extra damage and potentially set them alight. If you need food in a pinch, you can heat the rock, push it into a pool to boil the water, and then throw in the mushroom, which will cook and become edible. \n\nThe final aspect is that this game supports playing essentially however you want. In many roguelikes, leveling up is based on getting experience from fighting enemies, completing objectives, and so on. In Catacomb Kids, each floor has a leveling orb, which, once picked up, allows the player to level up once. Nothing else matters, as long as you get the orb, you can level up. That means if you want to play by dodging dangerous situations with teleportation magic, no problem. Want to slaughter everyone you come across? Cool. Tackle the levels however you want, because you won't be punished for skipping rooms and opponents like you would be with an EXP system.\n\n\nOverall, it's a very fun and unique experience that I think is absolutely worth $16 in the current state. The developer is very communicative as well, and does weekly Dev streams on Twitch.\n\nEdit: I forgot a HUGE aspect (equal playstyle representation), so I've updated the TL;DR and added the section.", "timestamp_created": 1424486663, "timestamp_updated": 1424570786, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 59, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.795997", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "14568996": {"recommendationid": "14568996", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997103678", "num_games_owned": 257, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 336, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468096515}, "language": "english", "review": "I have been playing this game for 15mins.

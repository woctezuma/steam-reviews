This is done by a disabled gamer who may have a difference critia from others but is a good propective on the game all the same\n\nMy base stats for this game:\n\nSound: 80% out of 100\nGraphics: 85% out of 100\nControllers: 60% out of 100\nReplay value: 50% out of 100 (will go into detail on this with controllers)\nADA (Americans with Disablities 508 complience) friendly: 60% out of 100%\n\nOverwall Score is a 67%\n\nSound and Graphics: Going for a paraody on the megaman (x) series it wass done well. I can see a lot of Cuphead style boss design with borg implants. This game hits home with my love for 2d with a 3d rendering. The sound seems to get a lot of influence from 8-bit titles like Goonies and Capcom era games from the NES with a updated flow and modern remix. \n\n\nControllers and ADA compilance: This is where the game has a lackluster tarish from having a higher overall. Where double forward gets you killed when you are use to Capcom's lovely interfere. The fact you have to smash the dash button mid-jump to use multi-dash jumps is a deal breaker for someone who has dextary or joint issuees. If you do not have these issues, count your self lucky but I do hold this against the title itself. Finding it is not ADA friendly is a huge issue in many games today. Some of the issues also stem from having less ground under you then Skiver's level in every single map or having more spikes then Alex the Red's level from MMX 5 where you need the ability to quickly pull out a series of dashes and jumps to have a chance....These controls should be refined with a beta tester who has experience with ADA or a disabled gamer to refine the layout. \n\nReplay value:....To add in\"salt\" to injury if you cannot finish the entire game on one life you lose everything. Not even Capcom at thier worst have they come close to making this mistake. This is \"Angry Video Game Nerd rage worthy\". It kills all fun of play in the fact that even in casual mode it is a kill joy. Mighty No 9 has better reseach and development in it practices. I would urge the developers to at least give a mode where one can keep the gear they collect and not punish those who have issues in mastering the game on thier insane diffculty curve. Besides that the levels are challedging and would feel like fun if the work was not so brutally punished for failure even to casual or disabled players. \n\nOverall: As with many indy developers I have reviewed over the years; it seems they have no clue as to what is good gameplay, too what is overly hard/easy, or even how to develop in a manner that supports good overall design for any player. This title is all too common to be riddled with flaws. The concept behind is niche, as it canters to a strived player community. That is acceptable but not giving a reasonable control system to allow for at least a par on the graceful controls of Capcom the IP owner of the original work this game is a paraody of shows the cheap feel that this game gives. That tarnishes all of the shinning achivement this game has for me and those like myself.\n\nI will review if the developers of this game give these issues a deep overhual.", "timestamp_created": 1514323406, "timestamp_updated": 1514323644, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.460733", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38686994": {"recommendationid": "38686994", "author": {"steamid": "76561198338588093", "num_games_owned": 21, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 350, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 350, "last_played": 1514362851}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6e38\u620f\u4e0d\u9519\n\u4f46\u662f\n\u7cdf\u7cd5\u7684\u8054\u673a\u4f53\u9a8c\n\u771f\u7684\u96be\u53d7", "timestamp_created": 1514271963, "timestamp_updated": 1514271963, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38686505": {"recommendationid": "38686505", "author": {"steamid": "76561198147771075", "num_games_owned": 49, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 2264, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 230, "last_played": 1514334567}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Es un muy buen juego de plataformas y su componente roguelite lo hace m\u00e1s entretenido.

In 20XX m\u00fcsst ihr euch wie in den Klassikern von Capcom durch 8 Level mit ihrem jeweiligen Boss durchk\u00e4mpfen, bevor ihr euch aufmachen k\u00f6nnt, in den finalen Leveln den Endgegner zu bezwingen. Es gibt auch in 20XX (bisher) zwei Charaktere: Nina, die wie Megaman X verschiedene Projektile aus ihrer Armkanone schie\u00dfen kann, und Ace, der seinem Schwertk\u00e4mpferkollegen Zero entspricht. Beide Charaktere k\u00f6nnen die F\u00e4higkeiten besiegter Bosse \u00fcbernehmen und in den darauffolgenden Leveln verwenden.\n\nDer gro\u00dfe Unterschied zu den Megaman-X-Spielen sind die Roguelike-Elemente. Genauer gesagt handelt es sich hierbei um [b]Permadeath[/b] und [b]prozedural generierte Level[/b]. Permadeath bedeutet lediglich, dass ihr nur ein Leben habt (es gibt zwar einen leichten Modus mit zwei Extraleben, der ist aber mehr f\u00fcr absolute Anf\u00e4nger gedacht und l\u00e4sst einen auch keine Errungenschaften/Achievements freischalten) und am Ende jedes Spiels all eure Ausr\u00fcstung und Upgrades verliert (egal, ob ihr verliert oder gewinnt). Ihr k\u00f6nnt jedoch w\u00e4hrend des Spiels sogenannte Soulchips einsammeln, mit denen ihr anschlie\u00dfend in eurem Hauptquartier st\u00e4rkere Upgrades freischalten k\u00f6nnt, die dann in zuk\u00fcnftigen Game-Sessions auftauchen k\u00f6nnen. (Es sei jedoch betont, dass ihr das komplette Spiel auch v\u00f6llig ohne jegliche Upgrades durchspielen k\u00f6nnt, wenn ihr gut genug seid.)\n\nProzedural generierte Level bedeutet, dass jede Runde anders ist, da sich alle Level jedes Mal, wenn ihr spielt, ver\u00e4ndern, was den Wiederspielwert von 20XX immens erh\u00f6ht. Level werden quasi auf zuf\u00e4llige Weise aus handgefertigten Levelst\u00fccken zusammengesetzt und Upgrades und Gegner werden nach einem bestimmten Schwierigkeitsschema (also je weiter ihr gekommen seid, desto schwieriger werden die Gegner) zuf\u00e4llig platziert.\n\nWer sich an diesen beiden Merkmalen nicht st\u00f6rt, den wird 20XX garantiert nicht entt\u00e4uschen. Die Steuerung des Spiels ist einsame Spitze (Tipp: Vsync im Spielemen\u00fc ausschalten) und der Wiederspielwert ist, wie bereits erw\u00e4hnt, extrem hoch (man siehe meine Spielzeit). Es gibt \u00fcbrigens auch eine deutsche \u00dcbersetzung, die zumindest das G\u00fctesiegel \u201eausreichend\u201c verdient, jedoch ist das Spiel, denke ich, selbst mit rudiment\u00e4ren Englischkenntnissen nicht allzu schwer zu verstehen.", "timestamp_created": 1513545125, "timestamp_updated": 1513545617, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503386", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38385240": {"recommendationid": "38385240", "author": {"steamid": "76561198390949547", "num_games_owned": 21, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 43, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506999965}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "um jogo legal no estilo mega man, vale a pena conferir", "timestamp_created": 1513541183, "timestamp_updated": 1513541183, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532020", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38382571": {"recommendationid": "38382571", "author": {"steamid": "76561198197682366", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 6440, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 688, "last_played": 1513729894}, "language": "english", "review": "Having played this game from the Alpha release, I can personally say that this is one of the best indie games I have ever played. The game scratches the itch left by the absence of megaman games in the last 7 years, with the last (actual) megaman game coming out on May the 1st 2010. It feels just like a megaman game should be, having smooth controls (which can be changed depending on your preference), an incredible soundtrack, and great character designs.\n\n[u] 20xx is a rogue like [/u]. If you have played rogue likes before, you of course know how things are with the genre. But for those who do not know, a rogue like is a genre of game where the player character is sent into a procedurely generated level and have to reach it to the end of said level, completing whatever challenge the game presents you with. You also will in fact lose whatever items you recieved during your run when you die (aside from certain acceptions). Throughout the game you will slowly unlock new items to encounter and obtain throughout your runs,  this encourages the player to keep playing and unlock all there is to obtain. Also as a final note on rogue likes, they tend to be quite difficult so you will hopefully get better as a gamer in general thanks to the challenge presented (that, or you will stop playing the game for whatever reason you might have, which is of course fine).\n\n[u] On to the design aspect of the game [/u]. 20xx has a 32-bit feel to it and it personally makes me feel nostalgic, having really gotten into platforming games because of Megaman X4. The sprites also of course have the said 32-bit feel to them, and have gone through alot of changes throughout the different patches for the game. The Bosses all have unique designs (some very reminiscent of early Megaman X bosses) that all have a borderlands style intro slide. \n\nBut that is all I will say so as to not cheapen the experience of the game for those who don't really want any kind of spoiler whatsoever, so here are my ending thoughts. 20xx is a great game to hold over megaman fans until the recently announced [u] Megaman 11 [/u] is released. The game is very unique and has a ton of personality. And while the game does have it's flaws, the overall experience you get from this game is great and will surely keep you coming back if you like platformers. \nSo take it from a long time platforming veteran, if you like platforming games, you will like this game. So please give it a shot, and if you don't like it go ahead and refund it. It's ultimately your choice on what you want to try, buy, or whatever.

I have 120 hours in this game. Let me tell you how much of a gem this game is.\n\nIt has the control tightness of Super Meat Boy with the insane power-ups of a game like Prototype, couched in Megaman-style game mechanics and aesthetics. In a word, it's addicting.\n\nPrior to it's 1.0 release, the game had *weekly* updates. To me, that tells me the devs 1) care about the game 2) care about the player base 3) rock and deserve free beer. When you launched the game, the game literally had a countdown indicating how long until the next update. No one playing post-1.0 will know that, no one who wasn't a beta player will know that, but it should be underscored and remembered. Every week, when my 20XX update started auto-downloading, I would always play because I would wonder what new powers they put into the game this week.\n\nIf you're reading this you probably already have a sense of what the gameplay is like, so instead of telling you about the gameplay let me tell you about the game design. The devs included Halo-style \"skulls\" which modify some aspect of the game. These skulls can be turned on/off, in any combination. \n\nIn the beta, dying meant losing all of the upgrades you've picked up on your current run. This is still true, but now you get the chance to re-buy some of the upgrades before starting your run. If you don't want to, you don't have to, but this gives players who don't want to start from zero the option to start their next run with a bit of a buff.\n\nAnother optional tweak the devs give you: the power-up drops in this game are random, but suppose you really hate some particular power-up. The devs added a neat \"de-program\" mechanic, which lets you eliminate some power-ups from randomly dropping in your upcoming run. This, like the \"re-buy\" mechanic feature I discussed above, costs \"soul chips\", which you pick up during a run. So these features are balanced in the sense that you can only re-buy and de-program according to how well you did on a previous run. \n\nThe key with both of these features is they are optional. The devs give you so many options it's mind-boggling to me how big name game companies don't invite these devs as consultants for their projects.

What a great surprise! I'm really amazed with this game. I've got much more than I was looking for.\n\nHere is a \"short\" description of the features of the game:\n\nCharacters:\nNina and Ace. Both are similar to Mega Man X and Zero. Nina has a buser, that shots forward, and Ace has a Saber that slashes enemies close to him. Both can charge their attacks, doubling the damage output.\n\nWeapons:\nYou can find other weapons while progressing the game to replace the default one. For example, Nina has a weapon that can fire four shots in the cardinal directions, and Ace has a Spear that can extend the range of his attacks.\n\nSpecial Powers:\nWhen you defeat a boss you have a choice to get his power, or another items. Each poer is unique and you can equip three special powers at a time, on different buttons. You can manage your active special powes on the pause menu.\n\nBosses:\nThere are 8 bosses (excluding the final ones). Each boss has a unique power, and is weak to another boss power. Much like Mega Man series. The difficulty of each boss increase as you progress through the stages.\n\nArmors:\nThere are 4 sets of armor, each one has 4 pieces: chest, foot, arms and helmet. Each piece for each set has an specific effect. For example, you can dash in the air, or double jump, get an extra charge for your weapon, use less energy for you special attacks, etc. You can use different pieces from different sets, or try to collect an entire set to get an extra bonus effect. \n\nItems:\nOn the Mega Man X Series, we had a few items, that could replenish or raise your health/energy. On 20XX we have many stats (movement speed, height of jump, attack power, and so on) that can be modified with items and power ups. Some items will give a minor increments, while others can give a huge boost in one stat, while decreasing other. Items can be found in shops on the stages, on special chests, or after defeating a boss.\n\nCurrency:\nThere are three currecies in this game:\nNuts: You receive those from chests or eneies. You can use them to buy items on shops, or exchange to HP and Energy on some machines.\nTokens: In some stages, before the boss room, you may find a slot machine, where you can use those items. You may receive a power up item, some pick-ups or, if you are unlucky, nothing.\nSoul Chips: Some special enemies drops those chips, that can be used to unlock new items, to be used on future runs.\n\nStages:\nIn 20XX the stages are randomly generated, so each run is unique. There is no fixed place for power ups, armor pieces and other items. There is no guarantee you will find an specific item in you run. \nYou cannot choose the first boss you will fight, and after beating the first stage, you have can choose between three bosses to proceed. They are not in a specific order, and you may not find the weapon of the previous boss useful against the next.\nThere is usually one shop (sometimes two, one of them right before the boss). Also, you may find a Glory ZOne in the middle of the stage. When entering on this room, you have a task to perform. If you are successful, you will get a piece of armor. Those tasks involve destroying enemies, reach the end of the room without damage, disabling traps, etc.\nDue to this random feature, the replayability of the game is enormous. You may have a very hard run, or you may become so powerful that you can destroy the bosses in a blink of an eye.\nOn normal mode, you have only one life, but there is no instant kill traps. Pits and spikes cause only damage. You can always adjust this selecting another difficulty setting.\n\nThe Ark:\nThis is the place where you start, and where you come back after a run. From here you can choose to play a game, select another mode (daily challenges, special runs, etc), switch characters, and unlock items or buy them to use on the next runs, with Soul Chips.\n\nMultiplayer:\nYou can play with a friend! The game will zoom in and out depending on the proximity of the players. The boss door will only open when both player reach it. If a player die, the other will continue alone until he can find a capsule to ressurrect the first. Power Ups picked by one player will affect the other. Armor pieces will appear in pairs, one for each player. It is possible to use two Ninas or two Aces. Tottally fun. I just wished there was a fight mode between players :)\n\n\nI already said too much and there is still a lot of good things I could mention about this game. The graphics are great, the animation of the characters is awesome, the response of the controls is perfet!\n\nI highly reccommend the game.

This in my opinion is how the game should have stayed. \nThis was a game that I always went back to again and again to try to complete it and I had a lot of fun doing it. \n\nYou went through the game hoping for that perfect run and upgrading yourself along the way. If you died, you lost it all and had to try again. \n\nAdding permanent upgrades means that you can basically start the game with an op weapon and a massive health bar and get to the end of the game really quickly which wasn't what the game was about when I played it. \n\nDon't get me wrong the permanent upgrades are optional and you can leave them off if you want to but anyone new to the game isn't going to have the same experience of 20xx that I had and I feel that's a great shame. \nI do highly recommend the game. It's an excellent challenging platformer with great graphics and controls. I just wish it was released without the permanent upgrade option. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9WXDoQIE_I", "timestamp_created": 1513017878, "timestamp_updated": 1513017878, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38213561": {"recommendationid": "38213561", "author": {"steamid": "76561198099556024", "num_games_owned": 162, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 174, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509066306}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Claro derivado de Megaman que coge todo lo bueno de la saga y lo rehace a su manera.

She looks like an ugly rag doll when she moves\n                  - Frustration because you suck and need to git gud\n                  - default control scheme is pretty bad, but you can rebind to get around this. however, will still sometimes \n                     (rarely) feel \n                     like you only \"lost\" because of using a keyboard (unless you have a controller)\n\nI think it's worth the fifteen, but maye a little steep for the penny pinchers.

years and I have seen it improve a lot. Yes, the basics were all there and you knew what the devs were trying to do, and it worked, it was fun. But now that the game is a few months released, the game is so polished. I look back on the old videos of people playing and it has come a long way. Granted, I'm not too terribly concerned with graphics, gameplay is what matters and boy does this deliver.\n\nI really have nothing bad to say about it besides it has quite a skill curve and it's tough to get far at the beginning while you are unlocking items for future runs. But that is all a part of the challenge and you feel a sense of progression. Also, it's hard to get my RL friends into it because you need a few hours to figure out the intricacies of the controls. \n\nI grew up playing mega man X. Probably the first game I ever rented at blockbuster. I rented it probably 3 more times after that. I've played them all. This game truly does scratch that itch for me. When I found out there were different upgrades for your character, that sealed the deal. I love it so much. \n\nThe controls are tight and if I mess up, it's my fault.\n\nThis review is kind of all over the place, but get the game if you love platformers of any kind.

I beat the game 4 hours of playtime ago, and I can't wait to get back in to challenge defiant mode with my buddy\n\nThe ONLY criticism I have is that they skimped on maps by having 8 bosses utilize 4 map-types (and therefore 4 level soundtracks). This is sad because the music is AMAZING and man what I wouldnt give for 4 more tracks of catchty-stick-in-your-head-all-day-chiptunes. That being said, if they put out a DLC for extra level maps, I would buy 2 copies of it immediately. \n\n10/10, highly recommend.\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1510984704, "timestamp_updated": 1510984704, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565191", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36575743": {"recommendationid": "36575743", "author": {"steamid": "76561197975291847", "num_games_owned": 57, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 260, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511741600}, "language": "english", "review": "I enjoyed this game various times, but I don't think I'll be playing it again.\nI clocked in a couple of hours alone, and about 2 hours with my brother (we both played the original Megaman series on the nes & snes).\n\nIt was really fun, even dieing was fun and funny.\n\nMy/our issues: (1) no real sense of progression and (2) there are only 4 tilemaps for levels so even though its \"procedurally generated\" you always end up with more or less the 4 same stages themes, who cares if the bosses are different they are only at the end anyways, it just gets repetitive pretty fast...\n\nThe bosses were also pretty easy, their patterns where very easily identified and so playing the \"procedural levels\" and getting to the same bosses everytime gets very repetitive very fast.\n\nFor 15$ I think this game is expensive but I enjoyed it. Im an aspiring Indie dev as well so I'm not getting a refund in order to support Chris, even though my 15$ isn't going to make or break him. I just feel like there is a general lack of content in this product and hopefully the Developer is willing to add in some more tilemaps just to change the feel of the levels which would do a great deal of difference. \n", "timestamp_created": 1510937278, "timestamp_updated": 1510937278, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36560441": {"recommendationid": "36560441", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025369789", "num_games_owned": 195, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 652, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510638777}, "language": "english", "review": "This game does what it set out to do (Megaman X gameplay in a roguelite format) pretty well, the movement and combat and whatnot is all solid and fun.

hours of gameplay).\n\nThe surprising thing was how relatively easy it was, not that it's a cakewalk but once I had a decent understanding of the game bosses went down pretty quickly and most of my failed runs came from it generating ridiculously difficult platforming segments (the second to last stage is guaranteed to have some), especially if I had the poor luck to not get a movement upgrade. \n\nI wouldn't mind a bit more stage/boss variety, you'll always encounter the same stages and bosses on any given run, but it does look like the game is still getting updates even though it's out of

Its strongest point, to me, is its pinpoint controls; no wasted motion, no sliding, no committed-length jumps. Controller support is on point, too. This is a standard-bearer for platformer controls. \n\nThe aesthetic is fun and colorful, attacks are flashy and the destruction animations/sfx are crunchy and satisfying in a way that even Megaman X wasn't. \n\nThere are two comparisons being made, though, that aren't quite apt: Megaman X and the Binding of Isaac. \n\nCompared with Isaac, the item pool feels painfully shallow. The game boasts 100+ items, but many of them fall under basic stat increases. Almost nothing in the item pool will define a run, will change the way you approach the game significantly. In Isaac, a player might start a run and find a powerup that makes every shot explode; this vastly changes how the player will engage enemies. 20XX is limited by its jump-n-shoot nature in that regard. \n\nAdditionally, powerups don't quite synergize the way they do in Isaac. Rather, they seem to just stack as the player grows into a much more powerful version of the same Nina they started with. Sure there are double jumps and such, but there aren't really alternate paths a double jump could make available. Why? Because not every run will have a double jump. \n\nThe level design has to exist, even in procedural generation, such that the player can get to everything with the basic kit. It feels like there are no secrets to find, no real rewards for exploration other than a chest containing a regular powerup. Megaman X crushes 20XX in this department.\n\nThe two comparable games also have lore. Megaman's is surface level and Isaac's is more esoteric, but 20XX has less of a story and more of a setting. The world feels hollow. \n\nBoss battles in 20xx are nothing like the ones from Megaman X. I have about 10 hours into the game and, even with a splash screen proclaiming the boss pre-fight, I can't remember any of their names. I tend to think of them as mask-wall-thing, bat boss, fire goat thing, chill penguin (oh, actually, I just remembered it's Shatterbeak), and the sunflower guy. Oh, and the wheel. They just don't do that much. It doesn't feel like the boss is fighting the player so much as just doing what it would normally do if you turned its power on. They're completely lifeless. \n\nThe music is nice, but not memorable, with the boss battle music being particularly underwhelming. I should feel like I'm in a life or death battle. Instead, I feel like I'm gardening or something. Beating the bosses feels like housework. Oh, I just remembered; the boss weapons feel unnecessary, too. \n\nOverall, 20XX is fun for a bit, but limited. Do not go in expecting Megaman X. If I'm completely honest, it still feels like this game is in early access. It's good, really good, but not for very long.", "timestamp_created": 1510736422, "timestamp_updated": 1510736422, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36518119": {"recommendationid": "36518119", "author": {"steamid": "76561198215959179", "num_games_owned": 70, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 607, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 6, "last_played": 1513959029}, "language": "english", "review": "A very aptly named game, as it will take 20xx years to bloody complete it", "timestamp_created": 1510689425, "timestamp_updated": 1510689425, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36509349": {"recommendationid": "36509349", "author": {"steamid": "76561197978093405", "num_games_owned": 218, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 866, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 139, "last_played": 1513593390}, "language": "english", "review": "The depth may feel lacking compared to some other roguelike games, but the crisp controls and varied movement powers keep every run feeling fresh.

With some caveats of criticism. This game isn't perfect. The procedural generation isn't fair and it takes some of the bad tropes of megaman, like the disappearing blocks, and places them everywhere in a little too much platforming and a little too little action. The enemies are interesting in some areas and generally boring in others. There really are only 4 level types to play and it was disappointing to see the bosses didn't each have their own unique area. The bosses get more HP and a few more tricks as you go through the upper levels, but only a few seem well done with this design and others seem blatantly unfair. Power Exploitation is fun for the bosses, but like some poorly designed Megaman weapons, you keep wishing they had more use than just for attacking. Some of the powers can be used to control traps in the areas, but it's lackluster due to the fact that the powers don't make the characters more accessible. 2 Shield powers, 2 Direct Shot powers, 2 Arcing mortar powers, a boomerang, and \"melee crystal\" that wishes it was a dash attacking power.\n\nMegaman has some difficulty, but there is a difference between a mistake of the player and a mistake of the level. This game suffers more from the latter in it's design. Most damage taken from falls will feel more like an issue of the level design and less of a \"This is a hard level\" feel. I would suggest working more of the procedural generation to keep full blocks for well timed wall jumps and areas that encourage a little more fun of shooting/slashing enemies to pieces. Ride Armors were fun in the X games, and their placement could also add to the fun. While I like the core upgrades spiced around the area, the only one that feels complimentary to the level design is the hover. Furthermore, it would be interesting to have the leg parts be avaliable more frequently than the others. Maybe it's just my bad luck, but it always feels like the upgraded parts tend to come in order of Helm, Armor, Arm, Boots. The idea of the set bonuses are also pretty nice but I think the fact the Owlhawk and the Armatort share the hover feature feels a little disappointing. Maybe Owlhawk should have some sort of higher jump/slow fall instead?\n\nIf there were more powers, more bosses, more enemies, more levels, and a little less of the obviously cheap design, such as half block wall jumps, off timed lasers and platforms, and boxed in jumps that require the most perfect of bunny hops, this game would be a real masterpiece. As it is, it's an inspired concept that needs more polish. I'll continue to play it from time to time and I look forward to trying the Co-op later.

As such, while it's not worth getting at full price, it's a good casual X-like game to try out when discounted. Do keep the following issues in mind though:\n\nThe vanilla game primarily suffers from being too easy. It tries to extend its replayability through modifiers and hard modes, similarly to Risk of Rain, but without the base difficulty to back it up. The balance is okay but not the best, with the Zero-like melee character being significantly easier and stronger than his counterpart to the point where he makes the game a cakewalk.\n\nThe level design also suffers from a lack of longevity. The procedurally generated levels are not only simply not on par with the handcrafted well-designed levels of, say, X1-X3, but you're also bound to see a lot of repetition very soon, much like in Dirt 4 (which also died out largely due to a flawed tile-based generator which generated significant repetitiveness). As such, the difficulty quickly turns into simply making sure you're not killed by the swarm of increasingly tougher enemies, though in my experiences the upgrade rate for the Zero-like character can easily eclipse the rate at which the enemies grow in strength.\n\nThe bosses are also very simple and lack the strategic beauty of those in the X games. While boss weaknesses do exist, for the most part there's no real point in using them as both the buster and the saber greatly outclass them in the vast majority of situations, especially when focusing on damage upgrades.\n\nHaving said that though, the game quickly gets fast and thrilling, which, for me, is easily the game's strongest suit. It's something I felt the SNES X games always lacked simply by virtue of being on the overly clunky and slow SNES. It's more reminiscent of the Megaman Zero games in that sense, which, barring the weird design choice of going with ranks and having them be important for getting new weapons, I always felt were significantly better than the X games. It certainly wouldn't surprise me if they took some inspiration from the Z games, seeing as the ending features a reference to Z4. The roguelike element does add some variety to the game as well and encourages different playstyles without really infringing on the main X-like gameplay. I've heard people mention that the graphics aren't its strongest suit, but while they do indeed look less visually appealing than those of the X and Z games, they definitely get the job done - the animations are fluid and sensible, the enemies and attacks are easily to discern and there are no issues with the camera or anything of the sort. I got used to it in just a couple of levels, without having watched any gameplay footage before.\n\nAll in all, it's a good game to do a quick run of every now and then.

I feel this is the true spiritual successor to those games.  The controls are tight and feel perfect which is a huge deal in these games.  The bosses are fun and I like the mechanic of giving them all tiers of diffuclty based on which order you fight them in.  The randomization of the levels at first I thought wouldnt work in this style of game, but I was wrong. Only real critisism of this is their are only 4 main types of levels plus the end stages 2 bosses each share a level.  This may be something they will change in the future it is minor as the 4 main stages that are presented I feel are done very well.  You have the ability to play as Nina or Ace which is the equivilant of X or Zero in the MMX series.  These two play quite differantly and it was a good idea to seperate them rather than try to incorporate melee into Nina's charater.  You do have to option for Coop however I have not at this time played it. While I feel it would be fun trying to do this with a normal play thru, when the game gets into higher difficulties i feel would be almost impossible.  Speaking of diffculties you have the option to play with various options turned on, such as enemies do more damage, or have more life, or move faster.  I like that you can toggle each of these indivudally.  My personal favorite addition is endless mode though.

It is a platformer with snappy controls and challenging stage layouts and bosses; it is a roguelike with random level generation and gear upgrading over the course of many, many runs; but first and foremost, it is a Megaman love letter and deconstruction all at once.\n\nThis review comes from someone with no experience with Megaman X, and little with the classic games, so if you're in the same boat, here's what I think independently of the obvious comparisons.\n\nIn 20XX, you play as either Nina or Ace, two robotic \"contractors\" created and now hired by Drs. Brighton Sharp and Arlan Flat (DEFINITELY not Light and Wily) to stop what seems to be a manner of robot invasion or takeover. To get the job done, you'll need to face down eight different bosses, each with different patterns and weaknesses and their own themed stages built at random. You're going to need all manner of upgrades, help from a friendly training robot and a very tired robotic cat, and some platforming skill to receive your \"payment\" for a job well done.\n\nThe game just FEELS good to play, once you get used to the dashing and walljumping mechanics. The controls are responsive and platforming is fun, if occasionally difficult. This is also a bit more fair than what Megaman games I've played, though it IS pretty difficult and I still don't have a full clear. Combat is satisfying and upgrades are interesting, even if some are underwhelming or can get you used to bad habits in terms of gameplay (leading to some \"damn you muscle memory\").\n\nIt's really a game you have to learn by doing. Each boss you kill drops a version of one of its attacks, which you can pick up and use for yourself (up to three active at one time) or forego for an upgrade or some money (and yes, the currency really is called Nuts, they know exactly what they did there and they run with it). Each boss, as is Megaman tradition, has a weakness to another boss's weapon, so you want to plan your route through the levels if you want to exploit them. Each boss power also has an \"additional\" practical use, and it can be fun to figure out synergies and how to go about using them properly.\n\nThe art style is very bright and bouncy, the soundtrack is fantastic. The game can get a bit busy visually at times, especially in the later stages, and the later bosses can be teeth-grittingly difficult (looking at you, late-level Astrals). Most of the levels don't feel like a long grind, though be warned that an overall run can take quite a bit of time, at least 30 minutes (though you can save and quit after boss fights). It genuinely does not feel that long. There are various difficulty modes so you can scale up the challenge for yourself with special conditions, a daily and weekly challenge, a seeded mode, and a boss rush.\n\nOh, also points for the writing. The game's quite funny. Look at the Datalore when you get a chance!\n\nAccessibility concerns:\nThe game is demanding visually especially at later levels. Things are moving very fast. Most things are clearly defined, but some platforms in Agnisort (fire/factory) levels can look like background elements, or background elements can look like platforms. Text describing upgrades and text in the Datalore entries is quite small and can't be scaled, however the UI can be scaled and changed between visual and numbers for easier understanding. Color differentation is somewhat important to distinguish the various \"elite\" enemies from each other (elites tend to have a black and red color palette) as well as pickups (green vs blue vs gray), and there are four different \"core\" armor sets corresponding to the colors pink, orange, yellow, and green, though these are distinguished by name and shape. The elite enemy designs might be sufficiently different, but I'm not colorblind.\n\nAs with any platformer, the game asks a lot of you physically, lots of button combos and dash-jumping is almost required, as is some level of button mashing. Controls are remappable, but the game recommends you play with a controller for a reason as a keyboard won't let you make all the required button presses at the same time. Powers are mapped to Y, LB, and LT on an Xbox-style controller by default, with dash being RT, A being jump, and X being shoot.\n\nThe game can get overwhelming at times with a lot going on, as should be expected with a platformer. There are a lot of sound effects happening at the same time. Hearing is mildly important to distinguish traps or enemy fire, though I wouldn't say it's required. Nina and Ace's grunting happens a lot and can quickly get VERY grating, so be warned.\n\nThe game contains brief flashes of light at some points, namely bosses. These are not sustained.\n\n\n\nAll in all, definite 8/10, glad I bought it, definitely worth it, there's lots to do. Though completionists beware.

This game is supposed to appeal to X fans but it is a totally different game. Instead of writing a fat paragraph I have compiled a pros/cons list to give you an idea on what this game is about. Cons list may be a little long, but maybe it's because my MegaMan x nostalgia keeps kicking in since the X series were my favorite games of all time and still awaiting X9 which may never come out, but I do still recommend this game.\n\nPROS:\n-Addictive\n-fluid controls\n-fast-paced gameplay\n-has online coop\n-accumilate points to unlock power ups and bonuses\n-gives you a choice when you defeat a boss to gain their weapon or pick other powerups\n-when you die, you start everything over, so you have to make best of each run and choose your powerups wisely\n-there are different type of helmet, buster, armor, etc. powerups that all do different things\n-there are in game challenges that will grant you extra power ups\n-every run you have will be different (1 run you may have a certain combo of powerups while in another run you'll have a different combination)\n\nCONS:\n-The music is not memorable (like it was in MegaMan x)\n-Graphics kind of seem like you're playing a flash game (kind of)\n-levels do not have much depth in them (even mighty no.9 had nice lengthy levels)\n-bosses seem a bit too easy (however there are difficulties you can choose with \"skulls\" to add more of a challenge like the latest Halo games)\n-you don't choose what level you want to enter when you begin to play like all of the MegaMan and MegaMan x series (you do choose from 3 everytime you beat a boss)\n-there is only the weak buster attack and the charged up attack but no in between (like MegaMan X had)\n-there are no hidden paths in the levels to find super secret power ups (like it was in X)\n-not very story driven (but doesnt ruin the fun of the game)\n\nI may have left some things out but you get the idea. Even though I recommend and enjoy this game a whole lot, it's not MegaMan x, and we may not ever get another MegaMan x. Times have changed and so has the way people play games nowadays.

The gist of it is every run, you start on a random boss and upon defeating the boss you choose from a random 3 out of the remaining 7. This is a great twist on the Megaman format of always going in the order of weaknesses being obtained and I would love to see the Devs start adding to the boss roster to really add more of that randomness.\n\nThe game scales its difficulty the farther in a run you go and often times will put your platforming skills to the test. That wouldn't go great if the controls didn't feel as fluid as they do. Especially after considering how it felt in those first few days of Early Access. The game has come a long way.\n\nHonestly, it's worth picking up for anyone to just try out, Megaman fan or not.

But oh no no no... in this version you'll despise the end of your run.\nHave you ever played one of the crazy over the top japanese bullet hells? Then imagine that, but on a 2D sidescroller with some potiential fuck up depending on your run. If you got flight boots, You're a lucky one, Air Dash? Yeah you're lucky, now if you don't have any of those? Either restart your run, or prepare for a hell of a time.\nThe game will designate enemies to block your path to lower your hp, and that makes it borderline impossible to fight the 2nd final boss, he's just a mixture of boss attacks with a little protect beetle which is annoying but still easier then the actual stage.\nFinally the Last stage, yes, you don't just fight the other boss right away, you have to go through yet another lovely unforgiving stage that will dwindle your HP and NRG, be sure you have the bolts necessary to buy hp and shop items cuz your NRG will be dead for the majority of these stages.\nThe final boss is cool at first but then becomes a repetitive mess and leaves your hands sweaty and slightly unsatisfied...\nTHEN have that you go though yet another segment that is even more hell then the final 2, again, horrible and unfair places and lava pits, luckily no traps, but you'll be fighting alot of enemies going through the final stage, some not hostile, some there to drain the remaining hp from your sorry sorry hp bar.\nThe end segment will not be like how Isaac's is, where you're either super OP or not, it will bleed you out of everything you own before giving you the conclusion.\nIt's such a good game. But the end game will not make you feel good and it will demoralize you, even when you beat the final boss, it just isn't satisfactory, it makes you work for that final damned cutscene...\n\nOverall I give this game a 9.5. its so awesome, the music is amazing, the enemies telegraph nicely and you can tell what their about just by looking at them, and the graphics are bright and happy.\n\nBut that end Segment will make you bleed and make you say/regret alot of items you wished you had.", "timestamp_created": 1508727637, "timestamp_updated": 1508727637, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35925012": {"recommendationid": "35925012", "author": {"steamid": "76561198176219297", "num_games_owned": 47, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 154, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508624575}, "language": "english", "review": "this is the kind of game that makes you happy about the indie game movement. it's a game made by gamers specifically to fill a niche of game that they (and others) have always wanted to play. it's like those people who made a metroidvania because they wanted more of those games to play. you gotta respect that. in this case it's Mega Man X fans attempting to capture a co-op experience. this would be admirable if nothing else, but a slavish devotion to recapture the general feeling of MMX ensures that from aesthetic to mechanics to physics you always feel that similarity. it's mostly appreciated, though at times overly derivative. the inspirational source would've been obvious without copying even the tiniest details like the silly boss names, while i would have personally liked to see the game twist its own identity in there a bit more.\n\nregardless a co-op MMX experience is a great idea and this delivers. it's an easy recommendation to anyone who simply yearns for a game of that nature. i struggle somewhat with the amount of action going on in this fast-paced widescreen game, but i also have not practiced much in single player. if there is a potential for frustration it's mitigated by short play times to complete an entire run, customizable difficulty options, and instant replayability.", "timestamp_created": 1508688838, "timestamp_updated": 1508688838, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35923465": {"recommendationid": "35923465", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043726774", "num_games_owned": 1050, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 143, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508684602}, "language": "english", "review": "If you like Mega Man and rogue-likes, such as Rogue Legacy, then grab this game. \n\nThe visuals are nice, the music is very Mega Man-esque, and the controls felt good.

I will say when you first start a run you will feel sluggish speed-wise until you increase your movement speed. Throughout the levels you gain nuts which can be traded for health and temporary power-ups. You also collect soul chips, which stay with you after death. Between runs you can trade the soul chips for permanent upgrades.

It gets a bit too obsessed with RNG, some things would have been much better being pre-generated, but it's an awesome platformer that any Mega Man fan should try.\n\nFull disclosure- I'm a huge Megma Man fan, especially of the X series. So if I'm biased- that's the reason.\n\nThis has got to be one of the most inventive platformers I've ever player. And it's all RNG. Even now, I can't believe how much of it is randomly generated. And the game doesn't feel like a horrific patchwork of stage design like some other RNG-reliant games do. Stages have a great flow to them, they're just short enough that they don't overstay their welcome while still managing to show off their respective gimmicks. \n\nBut probably my favorite thing about this game is how easily you can \"break\" it, and how it just doesn't care. See, pretty early on in a run, you can get leg upgrades that let you do some creative platforming. And with them, you can skip huge chunks of a stage. And the game manages to dissuade you from doing that: if you skip too much of a level, you risk missing some loot or health pickups. So that's a nice risk/reward balance right there. You're encouraged to explore, but if you want to speed run the game, you can easily do that, and the game supports it.\n\nThe soundtrack is also great. I was kind of expecting some Jrock a la MMX, and they kinda went with generic \"indie music\". But it's good generic indie music, so I don't care.\n\nYou can also customize the game's difficulty by playing on Defiant (hard) mode and activating or deactivating certain modifiers. Some of them just make the game more frustrating or remove cool features, such as this cat that you can buy that drops chests a certain levels that just won't be there in Defiant difficulty, but others do make for an interesting challenge.\n\nSadly, the bosses aren't great as the stages. They're kind of a joke. Most of them can be beaten by just mashing the attack button. Since almost everytihng in the game deals only 1 damage to you, you can only die from excessive chip damage. So the only benefit bosses have versus regular enemies is large health bars. And even those can be burnt to nothing with a few damage upgrades.\n\nBut while we're on the topic of bosses, they do look pretty cool. But in a reverse of the bosses are too easy problem, bosses are the only enemies that are visually interesting. Jim Sterling said that they look like Pokemon. I agree, they do. Unfortunately, they look like 4th generation pokemon.\n\nThe game also has some pretty serious communication problems. When you pick up upgrades, they're described in al ine or two of text. And these descriptions can be either perfectly adequate (attacks deal more damage) or uninformative. Or worse- they can be decieving. The developers chose to describe a lot of items and upgrades using baby talk, probably to come off as whimsical or to try being funny. Sadly, that often comes at the cost of telling you what an upgrade actually does. One of the two playable characters can get a big axe. The game describes it as something along the lines of \"deals massive damage, but very slow\". \"Slow\" isn't the actual handicap of the weapon- it has a horrible, uniterruptible aerial attack. Would've been nice to know about that before I bought it. Or, the game has \"very safe labs\" that can give you powerful upgrades that come with significant downsides. One of them says \"damage massively increased. For everyone.\" I thought that that means that only enemies deal more damage, and not environmental hazards like spikes, because it said \"Everyone\", not \"Everything\". The game lied there. Everything deals more damage.\n\nAlso, the game could really use some RNG controls. Sometimes, the RNG can actually cut whole features out of the game. For example- \"Glory Zones\" are mini-stages that you can find that provide with core upgrades- the game's equivalent of armor upgrades in MMX- when completed. These are awesome. They're pretty challenging, but give you worthwhile rewards for finishing them. But because whether or not they appear at all is RNG, you could (and probably will) have entire runs without them. Why? Why not give players an option to increase or decrease the likelihood of them appearing? You can later buy an upgrade that makes Glory Zones appear in every level, and it makes the game considerably more enjoyable. Why is that an upgrade and not a toggleabple menu option?\n\nAlso, let's go back to those core upgrades. They're also awesome. They give you interesting bonuses and can improve you platforming abilities by a whole bunch. And when you finish a matching armor set, you get some very, very impressive new power (such as dashing in the air three consequitve times, bye bye stages). But that also amplifies the RNG problem- the game doesn't care which armor upgrades you already have, so your chances of completing a whole set are very low. I've played the game a lot, and even so I could only complete two out of four armor sets, and even that was due to dumb luck.\n\nBut even so, it's a marvel that the game manages to be this fun when everytihng is randomly generated.

For one thing, and I'm sorry if the developer ends up reading this but the visual design just isn't very good. I by no means could draw anything remotely close, but visually it looks very amateurish, and reminds me of the sort of things that friends of mine would have been drawing in middle school. Charming in its own way, but a bit strange to me for a purchased product. I understand that this game isn't coming from even a small studio, but there are plenty of indie games that have a more polished look to them over all.\n\nNext, our stand-in for Zero feels useless on most levels, with the X stand in being far superior. I won't blame the devs for this too much. The nature of the game being randomly generated just sort of makes it feel like our X would in general be the superior character because they've got a ranged ability. On the plus side, this game does not force you to play as different heros! You can both be the X-equivalent or the Zero-equivalent at the same time, one of you implying playing a pallet swap. That's a huge plus for me.\n\nOn the much more minor side, I can say that this game does and doesn't support ultrawide (21:9 aspect ratio) monitors. While I find the normal stages render to the entire screen, the daily challenges or whatever they're called render in 16:9 letterbox. I'm not sure why. I don't really mind it all that much, I expected the game to do 21:9 with 16:9 pillar-boxing, it's just strange that it works in one and not the other. I'm sure there's a reason.\n\nNow, let's move on to positive, because now that I believe most of my gripes are out of the way, I do have a lot of positive things to say. First off, the game *feels* right in terms of how it handles. While the level design can sometimes be lacking, I feel like I'm playing a Mega Man X game, from the way you slide down walls, to the dash, or the dash-jump combo. It all feels right, and that's great. The game also runs very smooth and doesn't feel sluggish ever.  The games greatness weakness, the randomly generatedness, is also its greatest strength. There appears to be a lot to do in this game, and I doubt I'll ever become completely bored with it!\n\nIt's Mega Man X with Co-op guys! For a guy who really loves the series and only has one friend who really loves it too, this was a dream come true to me! You should have seen the look on my face when I was trying to find something that the both of us would enjoy playing with each other and I found a literal dream come true. I don't care about the negatives, this is a great find and I'll be logging a LOT more hours in the game than I currently have. (Probably sitting at around 3-4 hours at the time of writing?)\n\nI'm sure some would say the music isn't going to win any awards, but I quite like it and I'm happy that I bought the soundtrack. It fits the game well. I might add more to this review in the future because I've just scratched the surface, but I'd say despite whatever negatives this game might have if you've got a friend and you both love Mega Man X style games, absolutely buy this. If you're alone, I'd almost definitely say buy it. This fills a void that's been filled by essentially nothing since the release of X7.\n\nP.S.\n\nReally a minor complaint but, for the life of me I'm not sure why you have the default dash bound to I believe one of the triggers or should button. I instantly rebound it to the b on the Xbox 360 controller, because that's what the dash button would have been in the Mega Man X1-3 games, and I'm pretty sure most of the series as well on the equivalent controller. Executing a jump-dash just doesn't feel as easy or as right with the current setup. Not a big deal though-- buttons are rebindable, and I'm sure there's a reason for it that I'm simply just not seeing yet.", "timestamp_created": 1507537207, "timestamp_updated": 1507537207, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35589659": {"recommendationid": "35589659", "author": {"steamid": "76561197976114008", "num_games_owned": 129, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3618, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507598325}, "language": "english", "review": "Literally Megaman co-op with some added rogue-lite mechanics.", "timestamp_created": 1507526687, "timestamp_updated": 1507526687, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35572422": {"recommendationid": "35572422", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035901164", "num_games_owned": 286, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1915, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 93, "last_played": 1514253985}, "language": "english", "review": "I quite honestly can't say enough good things about this game.

Each of the weapons does extra damage to a specific boss (but I'll leave that for you to find out) and has another secret use.\n\nSome of the platforming (especially in the Sky world) can be a real pain, but it never feels unfair, as the character controls feel extremely tight and polished. Throughout the worlds, you will find challenge rooms, shops, and other areas, which grant you with pieces of armor and stat boosts.

Pero ahora el juego ya llego a su version 1.0 por lo que ya puedo dar mi opinion finalmente.\n\nSobra decir su semejanza con la saga de Megaman X: Personajes, obtener los poderes de los jefes (y que los jefes tengan un poder al que sean debiles),  armaduras, y la principal caracteristicas de la saga X que son el Dash y el deslizarse por las paredes. Pero los que diferencia a este juego (y su principal encanto) son los niveles generados aleatoriamente y el cooperativo que es genial, usando entre dos personajes que son Nina (quien representa a X) y Ace (que representa a Zero).\nLos niveles son tematicos de cada jefe (aunque algunos jefes comparten la tematica) y se sienten muy diferentes unos de otros, y tienen dificultades que pueden ser apaciguadas por ciertos items. Sobra decir que la dificultad de los niveles va creciendo mientras progresas en la run.\nEste juego como es tipico en Rogue likes tiene items que puedes conseguir a los largo de los niveles, despues de derrotar al jefe o comprando en la tienda, pero hay ciertos items que son bastantes unicos ya que son armas de doble filo. Me explico, te dan algo muy bueno pero te quitan algo, por ej: Incrementar muchisimo tu ataque con las armas pero no dejarte usar los poderes por el resto de la run o dar dos puntos de armadura por cada punto de vida.\nComo en los Megaman X, cada pieza de armadura te un pasiva pero el chiste es completar el set para conseguir una pasiva muy poderosa (Por ej: Si completas el set rosa todos tus ataques son cargados) y en este juego tambien podemos disfrutar de un set de armas (Dios, como odio el hacha para Ace).\nTambien quiero destacar la genial musica electronica que tiene este juego y las daily runs que pueden hacerse solo o acompa\u00f1ados por un amigo en local u online.\n\nPara terminar, para el estreno de este juego metieron los logros para Steam y lo que yo mas esperaba que eran unos buenos jefes finales.\nValio la pena la espera, recomendado 100%", "timestamp_created": 1507254161, "timestamp_updated": 1507254161, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.449173", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35478638": {"recommendationid": "35478638", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001533758", "num_games_owned": 149, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 1287, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 164, "last_played": 1514318770}, "language": "english", "review": "It's Mega Man X as a roguelike: Kill bosses, steal their powers, bite off more than you can chew, die horribly, repeat.", "timestamp_created": 1507144325, "timestamp_updated": 1507144325, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35451146": {"recommendationid": "35451146", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041496907", "num_games_owned": 120, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3284, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507212354}, "language": "french", "review": "20XX est un des meilleurs jeu ind\u00e9 que j'ai jou\u00e9.\nAchet\u00e9 en early access en juin 2016, le jeu n'a pas arr\u00eat\u00e9 de devenir meilleur.\nCe jeu est la fusion parfaite entre M\u00e9gaman et un rogue-like, des niveaux g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9s al\u00e9atoirement des items randoms, 8 niveaux avec leurs boss.\n\n\nLa direction artistique est superbe les niveaux sont toujours beaux avec chacun leur th\u00e8me.

Let's Rock! First of all, given the title, it's very Mega man X and to be fair, that's a huge +1 in my book.\n\nI grew up playing all the megaman games, espically the X series, as a child (and now). 20XX does what the lack of X (megaman) content we have gotten through the 10+ years by beloved fans creating their own vision and gameplay mechanics to life. The creators kept improving week by week with communicating with the fans to make the game  FLIPPING AMAZING! It's like the creators wanted us to take part in this, deep down, i say \"yes, that was their plan\" because this game feels alive and fresh.\n\nMighty #9 was a HUGE disapointment, it was slow, janky controls, poor level designs and was not fun in the slightest. I'm gonna talk about the individual aspect of 20XX...\n\n[Story]\nAs of course, judging by the title of the game, this does take place in the 20XX. Chaos starts happening around world, it's up to Nina (Megamwoman) and Ace (Zero) to save the day or earth or... their payment debts? actually the story is nothing to carzy, very megaman, which is fine.\n\n[Gameplay]\n20XX really took influences from the X series and snorted a ton of crack because holy HELL this game is FAST PACED!!! I've never heard my controller make so many clicks in my life since Megaman X4! The controls is tight and responsive. if you missed the platform or fall to your death, that's YOUR fault, not the game. The biggest mechanic in the game is the RPG elements. There are items, armors, shops, slot machine, weapons and secret weapons throughtout the game and it'll drastically change the way you play the game. You could be a tank built doing 100 damage for your basic attack and have 20+ health or become SONIC THE FREAKIN HEDGEHOG with your speed over 10+ and pass the through the main course in a heartbeat. The choice is yours alone playing the game. What makes this game have more replay value is the SEED system, meaning random generated levels like \"The Binding of Issac\". No area is the same. This game can be really hard, if not prepared or skilled enough.\n\nSPOILERS! SPOILERS!\n\n[Final Level/Final Boss]\nWhen I first played this game back on early release, they only had 3 bosses fully functional until NOW!!! After defeating all 8 bosses, you think your done until you go up to the teleporter at the end of 8th stage saying \"Onward\" and i'm like \"Wut?\" so you proceed on until you're in freakin SPACE! SPACE, THE FINAL FRONTIER! This level test all abilities for the final fight. YOU WILL DIE!!! This level is difficult, the enemies are stronger and level design is made to tick you off. Finally, reaching the end of the level, you fignt one of the evil doctors. He LITERALLY is a hybrid of all the bosses you fought. Shootin Minecraft? yep. Shootin ice shoots? check. Fire balls on your balls? Double check. This is a tough fight because the pattern is all over the place. I was damage boosting most of the time because i was like \"how dodge? Dodge to? WHAAAAAAAAAAT IS HAPPENING!\" After clawing your way to victory, you're rewarded 3 power ups letting you know that there is 1 level left... F#@K! You thought the previous level was hard? Pfffff nah. This level is Satan's butthole. However, somehow reaching the final fight. The final boss wasn't hard or anything but it was memorable because the room is HUGE and played out like small level to pass through and damage him. After defeating the boss, you think a cutscene or something but something feels off. After proceeding on, you go through another door then EVERYTHING IS BLOWING UP! WHOAAAAAAAAA! You have to dash your way out to the escape pod. Finally reaching the escape pod, you get brief cutscene of our main heroes escaping, the ship blows up their escape pod leaving a \"MMZ4 ending\" until it pans to the right to show our heroes alive and well.\n\n[The END]\nThis game melts my heart with how far it has become.

I highly recommend it.\n\nOverall I think it's a game with an amazing replayability. The game is hard but not punishing: falling makes you lose 1 HP and not your whole life for example. I have only tested the multiplayer in local at this point.\n\nPros:\n+ Tight controls. It took me 10 hours to finally beat it the first time in normal mode. It feels much easier now. You just learn to get better every time you play.\n+ Rogue like. This games reminds me of Toejam & Earl for its rogue-like elements despite being a fast action platformer. Every time you play it's different. The game takes me in average 1h to complete without rushing at all.\n+ Save & Quit feature at every end of a stage. You can play for 5-10 min if you want and continue the day after. This is ideal for people who work and can't really afford to spend a lot of time.\n+ Check points everywhere. If you fall you will just respawn to the nearest stable platform you have touched. You never feel like doing the same part over and over again.\n+ Great modern 2D graphics\n+ Catchy 8-bit music. They stick in your head like the music of Megaman.\n\nCons:\n- Bouncing character effects. When your character is in movement and then stop you can see this bouncing effect like if every part of your character tries to resist the movement. A lot of indie games on Steam I have played have that. For some of them it adds some charm to the game but for a Megaman like I expect tight controls and pixel-perfect precision. The controls are tight but the bouncing effects makes you feel they aren't.\n- Small minor bugs here in there. Very rare though. It's not breaking the gameplay but they are visible enough to be mentioned.\n\nWarnings:\n* This game is not really for casual players. It's hard and requires training before finishing it. It took me 10 failures before I finally beat the game the first time.\n* It's a rogue like, you must not mind losing. As I said, I started with a Win/Lose rate of 1/10 (probably more actually). If you play a game in order to complete it in one go, that's not going to happen.

That game was so painful it made me bitterly against roguelikes.\nTo paraphrase the current US president: \"The problem with Enter the Gungeon is not that it implemented rogue-like elements wrong, but that it implemented rogue-like elements faithfully.\"\n\n20XX is different, better, and far more fun. This is because it removes the most terrible rogue-like element; 20XX removes torturing the player for no just or discernable reason and then removing your all progress in the game.\n\nThat being said, here some 20XX flaws:\n-Moving platforms are sometimes too close vertically to jump in between them, or too closely packed together otherwise, causing many unnecessary falls. Some non-moving platforms also have this problem.\nExamples include certain areas randomly found in the Fire Level (Agnisort I think it was called), the Sky Temple to a lesser extent, and the final level\n-Your movement and jump stat bonuses will kill you. If you improve your speed too much, your character will fly off so fast they miss the platform you were aiming for. If you improve jump height too much, your character will accidentally slam into a spike or damage area. Movement needs to be consistent in a platformer, or it breaks the player's rythym.\n-Minor art concerns. Not the style, but the animations bother me. The best example I have is when you stop walking. When you come to a halt, your upper body flings forwards slightly. It would make more since if the character stopped themselves with their legs, like happens in real life, but instead their upper body swings like a bobblehead for a moment. There are more examples of animations like this, but I don't have time to nitpick all of them.\n\nRegardless of the above dialog, I will end this review with a sentiment many people here have clearly said and echoed.\n\"Don't get Mighty No. 9, get 20XX!\"", "timestamp_created": 1506776449, "timestamp_updated": 1506776449, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35314393": {"recommendationid": "35314393", "author": {"steamid": "76561197979998458", "num_games_owned": 407, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 774, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509249085}, "language": "english", "review": " I bought this during early access, played enough to know I liked it then shelfed it for its full release. \n\nThree words:\nWorth The Wait\n\nIf you liked Megaman X you'll like this.

I'm going with Thumbs up because I had fun for a while with this game, but I found plenty of things I didn't like. In general, I liked much more the platforming elements than the rogue-like ones. If you are more into the platforming than the rogue elements, this Megaman-like game is definitely for you. But if you are looking for a game which good replay value, well, think again.\n\nPROS:\na) Good platforming elements, although also a bit uninspired. Worlds are at least well differenciated from each others.\nb) Good controls, the dash is a little tricky but it's until you get used to it.\nc) Nice colourful graphics.\nd) Enemies are varied and well designed.\ne) Really good and varied boss fights. That has to be the thing I liked the most. Also, bosses weapons are fun, though some are more useful than others. Also, each boss is weak to one of the other weaopns, which is cool.\n\nCONS:\n- They have to do with the rogue-like aspects in general: \na) Levels are not actually random, they are generated from preset chunks that get together according to which level you are at that moment. This is one of the worse things I found, as you don't really feel runs are much different from each other, which drastically reduces the replay value the game has. I get that this may have to do with the balance of the game. Still, it's a dissapointment. After 4 hours I already felt I was playing the same levels all over again. Fine for a platforming game, but not for a rogue-like which is supposed to have random levels.\nb) Also about the levels, no secret areas whatsoever. Exploration is rarely promoted throughout the game.\nc) In the same tone, augments rarely make runs very different from each other. Most of them are just stat modifiers. They don't actually add new ways to play and beat the game, just more of the same. \nd) The only thing that add some variation are bosses weapons, but most of them are useless anyway. Much more when taking one of them means you are not getting more augments or nuts.\ne) There are no relevant builds you can make, as damage and life are the 1st and 2nd most valuable stats. You pretty much always have to aim to increase those. \n\nTL;DR: Platforming aspects of this game are good enough, specially the boss fights, but I can't say the same about the rogue-like elements. The lack of crazy randomness that make runs actually feel different from each others is really noticeable in 20xx. Levels are not actually random, while most augments are just stat modifiers that don't add nothing new to the table. I feel like they wanted to keep the game balanced at all costs, which leeds to stale, boring and repetitive runs for the most part.

Likewise, it plays like a \"roguelite,\" featuring fairly short (~45 minutes) runs through procedurally generated levels full of randomly selected powerups, forcing you to adapt your playstyle to the abilities you are given in your current run.\n\nCompared to a normal Mega Man game, it's significantly easier in some senses, with early bosses falling very quickly to basic attacks and no instakill traps (spikes just hurt, pitfalls send you to the last solid ground you were on), but this makes sense given that it's a \"roguelite,\" with death ending your run. The levels are also procedurally generated, rather than hand-crafted, which adds to the replay value significantly but, unfortunately, provides one of the few points of frustration I have with 20XX: some layouts are absolutely obnoxious without a \"proper\" set of mobility abilities, and can't be forced through at the cost of health due to either falling down during a climbing section or being sent back a good distance by a pitfall, leading to the very few unfair-feeling losses I've had.\n\nCompared to a normal \"roguelite,\" it's a fairly standard setup with persistent unlocks between levels, both in the form of a limited set of permanent upgrades, and new random items you can make available for your future runs. (You can also spend the persistent-unlock currency on a small selection of bonuses for your next run only, so it never stops being useful.) It's also on the more merciful side, with a low difficulty mode which offers you three lives before your run ends and the ability to save a singleplayer session between any two stages, though it also features quite a few extreme difficulty options for players who want to rise to the challenge, through a customizable challenge mode system, as well as fixed-layout daily and weekly levels with leaderboards, both in normal difficulty and challenge-mode difficulty.\n\nMentioning \"a singleplayer session\" hits on my favorite thing about 20XX, though: it has two-player cooperative multiplayer, both local and over the internet, and it's amazing. Despite the \"loading some sketchy netcode\" loading screen, by the end of Early Access the netcode for 20XX has actually been quite stable, though with occasional glitches, and multiplayer Mega Man is one of those things I never knew I needed until I had it.\n\nAll in all, 20XX is a good entry in the indie \"roguelite\" category, and a very good Mega Man-like game. It comes in highly recommended for any \"roguelite\" fans, and recommended for fans of Mega Man if they're not opposed to a version focused on replay value rather than polished, hand-crafted level design. Even if you're not particularly into either of those, it's a fairly solid action platformer - probably a bit harder than average, but significantly easier than Super Meat Boy or something, and I would still recommend it even at full price.

You jump, dash, dodge, and shoot your way past death lasers, fireballs, flying icicles, vanishing platforms, various enemies and bullets, to kill bosses. Then you rip their arm-guns off their corpses, and use them to beat the next stage. The game's bright, it's got a wickedly upbeat chiptune sountrack, and it's plain good fun!\n\nThe extra stuff you'll see:\n- Some boss weapons neutralise various environmental hazards, making platforming much easier as long as your special weapon energy lasts, so you need to decide whether to use energy to make the platforming easier, or conserve energy for enemies (especially bosses) or future, possibly nastier hazards.\n- Failing an obstacle 'only' causes some health damage (and a respawn nearby, in the case of falling off the stage) rather than being insta-death like the games this pays homage to. Casual-friendly!\n- Each playthrough features randomised levels from playthrough to playthrough.\n- You can buy upgrades during a playthrough, so there's a little stat-allocation / RPG-lite involved.\n- You unlock upgrades outside each playthrough depending how well you did in the last playthrough. The newly unlocked upgrades will show up in later playthroughs. As these get progressively stronger and have more interesting interactions, you'll progress further or faster in each playthrough as you unlock stuff, and the game experience varies more depending on what items appear during your playthrough.\n- In the 'hard' mode you can add skulls to make the game even more challenging, anywhere from a bit harder, to impossible. And yes, you can make it so spikes and falling off the stage kills you instantly. Just like it should be. I'll never turn this on, I'm a scrub =P.\n- There are daily and weekly challenges where your randomiser's 'seed' is set to a fixed value, so you play through the exact same layout as everyone else. There's leaderboards for those, if you're into that kind of thing.\n\nMy first few playthroughs were short because I sucked. As I got better, playthroughs took longer until I finished the game. I think my first completed game on easy mode was about ninety minutes or so. Now, I'm better again (and have unlocked more stuff) so a playthrough takes an hour or less. I've also had a few satisfying playthroughs where I only had twenty or thirty minutes spare, so it doesn't take a huge time commitment.\n\nWhy buy it?\n- This game is great for something light to jump into even for a half an hour.\n- This game scratches the platformer-shooter itch just right.\n- Each playthrough varies, so there's plenty to keep it fresh even though the core game is quite simple.\n- You can choose whether you want to play anywhere from casual-ish difficulty all the way past Nintendo Hard to suit your taste each playthrough.\n\nIt's not perfect, of course. There isn't a huge amount of enemy variety, and if you get unlucky with the randomiser, your playthrough will be rather short. It's also a game that I find I cannot 'binge' on, typically doing one playthrough per session.

It seemed to me like I probably wouldn't be buying my favorite new Mega Man X game. I wanted to, of course, so I told myself that I was essentially voting with my wallet on the concept of a Mega Man X knockoff with superior gameplay mechanics. That's what the reviews of the time said this was ... and probably still do.\n\nTo start with, yes, this game is procedurally generated. That's not just some nonsense made up to hype the game (which is what I'd expected at first). The procgen system is used to assemble entire levels from a cache of connectable level components, some of which are fanmade. The transitions between any two level peices is so seamless that it feels like playing a contiguous level every time, in fact. Which is what the procgen is doing in this game to begin with - making it impossible to effortlessly speed through every level by memorizing them all. It spits out a new level every time, or new enough that you're not going to know where all the hidden items are when you start each level, where the enemies will spawn in, nor what variety of difficult platforming challenges await. That's not to say that you can't zoom through levels without breaking your stride, taking out every enemy along the way, if you're skilled enough to do so. And unlike most rogue-lite (and other rogue-) games, your skill will have a bigger impact on your performance than your luck will in most cases.\n\nIt's not all positive, though. Arguably the largest problem 20XX still has is that it's got only five distinct levels for its ten bosses to inhabit. Each level will be used for two bosses apiece. They still generate fresh ones with every load, but Agnisort is still Agnisort. If you've played No Man's Sky you'll know what I mean (it's like saying \"The snowy planet is still the snowy planet\"). There's also no Steam Workshop support for fanmade characters, levels, etc. And the items you can get instead of taking the weapon from a defeated boss are absolutely not even close to worth what the boss weapons are, which sucks especially severely when you're faced with the prospect of tokenly picking up a crappy boss weapon just to break even loot-wise (and maybe feel a little better about a crappy deal in retrospect).\n\nBut the moment-to-moment gameplay? Superb. The visuals? A brilliant middle ground between the Mega Man X sequels on PS1 and a Newgrounds Flash game. The balance? Think 'Mega Man X for SNES'.... 20XX is now my favorite game in this subgenre, having beaten out every Mega Man (and X) game (that I've played) for that distinction. None of the Mega Man games let you play one playthrough endlessly as the game made up levels for itself on the fly. They didn't have co-op play. They weren't this balanced, for the most part (X1 being the exception). They didn't let you upgrade every aspect of the main character during a single playthrough (though you lose your upgrades between playthroughs in 20XX). And they clearly weren't playtested to Hell and back like 20XX was in its early access phase. This is one of the best 2D platformers I've ever played in my life, and I say this as someone who was young when the NES and Master System were new. If you're an old Mega Man fan and want to find a new classic in the same niche, 20XX is exactly what you're looking for. It's a great game to play with a podcast on instead of the in-game music, too. 9.6/10.", "timestamp_created": 1506023609, "timestamp_updated": 1506052709, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35112015": {"recommendationid": "35112015", "author": {"steamid": "76561198082557053", "num_games_owned": 99, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 95, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 14, "last_played": 1514177409}, "language": "english", "review": "Great Game,  Great Control, Great Soundtrack, Great Nostalgia.

My mom wanted to go visit one of her friends and I was very young at the time so I had no choice but to go. To make a long story short, thankfully they had an SNES and left me alone to play. I will never forget that day as it was my first introduction into the amazing world of Mega man games. The platforming, the power ups and the boss fights, even when I was young I realized there was something that just clicked with this game, it was perfect.\n\nAs an adult I still play Mega Man X and love for it all the same reasons. Being older made me appreciate the game more with its amazing music, tight controls, and fun level designs. There were times though I wished I could play it with someone else. I think the developer of 20XX felt the exact same way.\n\nGetting to the point, 20XX is the Mega-man game we all deserve, need, and should play. While I would say 20XX borderlines on plagiarism, I can\u2019t really call it a fault because it is done so damn well. Not that 20XX doesn\u2019t make itself unique with its own ideas but at the end of the day it doesn\u2019t stray far from the formula.\n\nLet\u2019s be honest though, with games like Mighty No 9 that probably isn\u2019t a bad thing. Let\u2019s get to the features like an anime fan on prom night!\n\nThe year is 20XX and because of that there are Robots!\n\nThat more or less covers the story for the entire game. If 20XX had a fault it would be that it has a non existent story. I am not saying that Mega Man was Westworld or anything close. However, 20XX doesn\u2019t even make a small attempt at a story whatsoever. You just have two scientist who are making robots for giggles?\n\nStory aside, the game is exactly feature for feature on par with its inspiration in all other aspects.\n\nNow if for some reason you had a life and don\u2019t know what this game is about. 20XX is an action platformer/roguelike that has a heightened focus on nailing precise jumps, shooting, and fighting bosses and stealing their powers. You can then use those powers on other bosses who might have a weakness to that power. Think simple: fire beats ice, wind vs lightning, etc. You have a choice of two heroes, either the blue shooter or red slasher. (Sound familiar?) Each of these characters, fundamentally, plays differently. While I enjoyed both, I found myself enjoying red slashy guy the most.\n\nThe moment you load up your first level you are going to instantly feel familiar with this game. You can dash, shoot/slash, jump, wall bounce, it\u2019s all there. The beautiful part is that it works exactly how you would expect it to and how it should. The only caveat that I could think of is that this game is BEST with a controller. I didn\u2019t even try using anything else because it wasn\u2019t meant for it. Now a game like this is broken or made on the response of its controls and thank god 20XX nailed it.\n\nCombat is smooth and enjoyable. You have one goal, which is to go from left to right and fight the boss. Both characters have a multitude of strategies available to them depending on what power ups they unlock. These power ups are unlocked in the hub area or completing bonus challenges in the levels. You might find boots that give you a double jump or a different type of main weapon. Platforming is easy to do but hard to master. The only gripe I had with the controls was the constant need to hold down the dash button. Holding that button made you faster and was downright necessary for certain platforming challenges. This led to some moments where I would accidentally dash off a ledge to my death.\n\nWhat makes 20XX unique is how it approaches upgrades, level design and difficulty. The \u201croguelike\u201d factor comes in the form of procedurally generated levels. Meaning that each play through should have a different combination of platforming challenges. You can also find random boxes with money and health, loot etc. The game basically tells you to forget trying to memorize the level design and for the most part, it\u2019s right. There are however times that I did spot the same platforming challenges over the four hours I played. Despite that, I never found any of the levels dull, poorly designed, or over staying its welcome.\n\nOne aspect I enjoyed is that as you get deeper into your run the enemies do begin to change depending on what bosses you choose to fight first. As an example, heading into the flower boss level early on you might find the enemies to be slower and not as aggressive. On the flip if you were to fight the flower boss as a later choice, all those enemies are upgraded/champion versions of themselves whom are far more powerful and aggressive. This gives 20XX plenty of replay value as your enemies in a way are getting upgraded abilities the same way you are. Not forgetting to mention the shifting level design.\n\nAs you play 20XX you begin collecting Soul chips which is a currency you can spend to unlock new kinds of upgrades. When you finish a run you are returned to the hub area where there are multiple shops. Some of these purchases are temporary, benefiting only the next run. Others are permanent upgrades like finding a chest at the beginning of a level or health boosts. The hub area also gives you access to the many daily/weekly challenges. If all that wasn\u2019t enough there are also multiple difficulty modes. One that includes modifiers to make it even harder.\n\nOne area that 20XX does separate itself on is aesthetics. \n\nWhile everything does feel \u201cfamiliar\u201d and there is plenty of robot action and mayhem. Graphically 20XX is different. Obviously everything is still cartoony looking but 20XX is made in 2017 and it shows. Everything is incredibly smooth when it comes to animations, effects and character design. It does enough for it to feel like a modern take on a classic but still keep the heart and soul. I will admit there are times I missed the anime themes the way X presented them, but that is more a personal preference and far from a gripe.\n\nMusically 20XX is fantastic. While I am not a musical aficionado I can say that I personally enjoyed it. The music does a good job of keeping your heart pumping and keeping up pace with whats on the screen. Now I admit there are times I was too focused on jumping to notice the music but it was doing its part when I did. Sound effects are okay and par but I did feel like that they were just lacking a little bit.\n\nIn all I had a hard time finding a gripe with the game visually. It makes me wonder what they could\u2019ve done if they had four million dollars, hmm.\n\nPurely nostalgia driven or not 20XX is a fun game.\n\nIf you asked me would I like to play Mega Man with a friend, I would\u2019ve said hell yes. 20XX lets you do that and it works perfectly. Is this a game that is going to please everyone? No, but it\u2019s a far better quality then other games with the same ideas. Even if you aren\u2019t a nostalgia addict, as a roguelike its a good game and offers plenty of replay value.\n\nI have seen people play this game upwards of twenty plus hours. I don\u2019t think I personally could get that mileage out of the game. Each play session is about an hour or more. Obviously high replayability is the focus here as you unlock more upgrades, abilities, etc. The only thing I personally wished for was more bosses. There is a serious lack of boss variety in 20XX.\n\nTo wrap up, 20XX does plenty to innovate old ideas and keep true to the source. I recommend this title to any retro fans or people who enjoy roguelikes. There is plenty to enjoy here and I underline again the fact you can do it with a friend. I personally can\u2019t wait for the sequel 20XXX.", "timestamp_created": 1505586897, "timestamp_updated": 1505586897, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547325", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34996691": {"recommendationid": "34996691", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997585444", "num_games_owned": 148, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 6007, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 439, "last_played": 1514027658}, "language": "english", "review": "Basically this game is designed to be a roguelite megaman X game and as such the most important thing to get right is the feel of the game, the responsiveness of the controls and the basic enjoyment of just shooting stuff. \n\nAnd this game gets it perfect.

The art style is a bit... newgrounds? (Although not without its nice touches in animation, like charging up a shot or when at low health). The cutscenes are really rather low budget and seem to tell a different story to what the gameplay and lore actually says. the music however is excellent and exactly what you'd expect from a game like this.\n\nThe rest of it is the usual issues that you will either love or hate about the RNG nature of rougelites.

The name of the game is simple: beat all the bosses and give the big bad(s) at the end what for. However, as roguelikes do, if you die on your journey to defeat all the bosses once (or three times if you play on the easier \"Reverent\" mode) you will be forced to start again. On your multiple \"runs\" you will acquire augs, items that improve your parameters, cores, armor pieces with varying abilities which can be mixed and matched to suit your playstyle, and different basic weapons, altering your basic attack, for the current run. A unique currency, soul chips, can be earned on your runs to unlock new items to appear or buy a few already unlocked items that you can use on your next run. There are two characters, Nina and Ace, who function very similarly to characters X and Zero, respectively. You can switch between which one you want to play in between runs in the hub area. \n\nLevel design is procedurally generated. While this is nothing unusual for a roguelike, this is the part where I stress that Megaman X fans may not love this game as much as other people are saying they might. In Megaman X games each level was carefully crafted and could be revisited at any time. Whichever stage you went to first, there would doubtless be little secrets or areas that you couldn't access until you had a specific upgrade or weapon. Then, you would revisit it, and get the item that was behind that wall or underneath that truck or anywhere else under the sun that it might've been. 20XX loses that element due to procedural generation of levels. There's no set order for you to receive core (armour) upgrades and after one boss you only have 3 random bosses out of the remaining bosses to choose from, along with being unable to revisit cleared levels in that run. There are out of the way small hidden areas with augs, but in my opinion there is only one specific generated secret area that is actually that hard to spot.\n\nI bought this game a while back during early access after seeing mention of it elsewhere and as a fan of both Megaman and roguelikes was instantly hooked. While I haven't been around supporting the game as long as most longtime supporters, I have seen the work that has been put into this game by the developers in that short time and I can see that they truly care about this game. That is a very strong quality that is sometimes missing in certain games nowadays. As you play, read up on all the enemies and items, and listen to the music you can see the love put into it by all parties involved.\n\nA condensed list of pros and cons, some that I didn't touch on above\n\nPros:\n-A soundtrack so good it's a crime\n-For the most part, plays like a Megaman X game\n-Online leaderboards and rankings catered to speed runners\n-Massive replayability\n-Local and Online multiplayer\n   -Both players can play as the same character if they want to\n-Just funny enough\n-Lots of data lore on every item, core, boss and enemy in the game accessible with more appearing as you defeat them more and more times. For you readers out there who want a taste of the world and setting of 20XX (like me)\n-Has been polished for years by a very devoted team\n-The soundtrack is so good I have to give it two separate points\n-A hard \"Defiant\" mode for players who want a challenge, with a multitude of modifiers to make your game harder\n-A robot cat\n-Really good looking\nCons:\n-Lacks certain Megaman X elements that may make or break the deal for some people\n-Procedural generation may get boring after seeing the same combinations a lot of times\n-Some secret areas are not so secret and also suffer from being repetitive\n-Controls may feel more \"slippery\" compared to Megaman X\n-No secret street fighter moves\n-Some players may have to unlock a large amount of items before being able to finish a run due to difficulty spikes at certain points catching someone off guard\n\nTo bring things to a close, 20XX is not what Mighty No. 9 should've been, but shares elements of what mighty no.9 was emulating. If you are looking for a real classic Megaman X game that has everything that that series did, you will not be wholly satisfied with 20XX, but may still find it a pretty neat game. If you're into roguelikes, definitely give this a whirl. Even if you're a Megaman X fan, I would still recommend you give this game a try so long as you aren't put off by the roguelike aspect. \n\nOne last little thing from me. It's easy to say this game is \"A Megaman X roguelike\" and possibly disappoint a few people but I have come to love this game as itself and not as a Megaman X-esque roguelike. Even if you have no expectations going in, I totally recommend this game.", "timestamp_created": 1505270213, "timestamp_updated": 1505270213, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.563492", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34905794": {"recommendationid": "34905794", "author": {"steamid": "76561198279077034", "num_games_owned": 47, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 246, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505239158}, "language": "turkish", "review": "Baya g\u00fczel ancak yeni update ile a\u00e7\u0131lm\u0131yor", "timestamp_created": 1505239238, "timestamp_updated": 1505239238, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34896227": {"recommendationid": "34896227", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004097512", "num_games_owned": 10, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2637, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 304, "last_played": 1514343341}, "language": "english", "review": "First ever review of a game and its well worth it. 20XX is an amazing game with solid mechanics and true tribute to the Mega Man X series. \n\nPro\nco op\nlots of unlocks\nsmooth mechanics \ngreat level design\n\nCon\ngame leaves you desiring for more content but its a solid amount for now", "timestamp_created": 1505199169, "timestamp_updated": 1505199169, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34890626": {"recommendationid": "34890626", "author": {"steamid": "76561198138213224", "num_games_owned": 838, "num_reviews": 62, "playtime_forever": 323, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504835998}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "[h1]20XX[/h1]\n[b][i]Review tamb\u00e9m publicada com minha autoriza\u00e7\u00e3o na curadoria Mamilos Club.[/i][/b]\n\nDesenvolvido e distribu\u00eddo pela Batterystaple Games em parceria com Fire Hose Games, 20XX surgiu com quem n\u00e3o quer nada e acabou espantosamente preenchendo um pouco da lacuna deixada pela Capcom ao n\u00e3o desenvolver novas aventuras ap\u00f3s a saga X de MegaMan, embora Nina \u2013 nossa hero\u00edna \u2013 ainda n\u00e3o seja ovacionada como merece, ela vem conquistando uma legi\u00e3o de f\u00e3s e com m\u00e9ritos, afinal o t\u00edtulo possui mais de 90% de aprova\u00e7\u00e3o na plataforma Steam.\n\nA hist\u00f3ria do jogo \u00e9 extremamente clich\u00ea \u2013 claramente inspirada no rob\u00f4 azul da Capcom \u2013 e tamb\u00e9m traz dois cientistas fazendo experimentos que resultam no descontrole das m\u00e1quinas, agora cabe a voc\u00ea e seu parceiro \u2013 Ace, que seria uma refer\u00eancia ao \u201cZero\u201d \u2013 neutralizar todo este maquin\u00e1rio e salvar a humanidade do caos.\n\nA jogabilidade \u00e9 simples e nada diferente dos jogos roquelike, para quem j\u00e1 teve experi\u00eancia com MegaMan ou algum jogo similar, os controles s\u00e3o familiares, assim como os movimentos e habilidades, o grande diferencial de 20XX \u00e9 que mesmo no modo mais \u201cf\u00e1cil\u201d ele mant\u00e9m um bom n\u00edvel de dificuldade, algo que faz o game ficar ainda mais interessante e exigir dom\u00ednio e aten\u00e7\u00e3o nas fases.

Abilities mostly seems useless for me because standard armour and weapon upgrades more and more powerfull and usefull.\n\nAnyway I recommends this game to play because it's very fun to play at coop the game with favourite gameplay.

The platforming in level 6 or farther becomes exponentially more difficult if you don't RNG one of the 3 good leg Augs, which because this is a roguelite you have no guarantee to get. It also makes the harder versions of some bosses MUCH harder than they would be if you had decent movement options.\n\nSecond, unlocking a lot of the buyable/collectable augs after the first 5 or so runs ends up being a detriment in a lot of scenarios when it just increases the pool of options that you can get from stores/chests for augs. A lot of them are useless depending on existing upgrades and some can be actively bad for you.\n\nOn the positive side, the gameplay is immediately familiar to veterans of the Mega Man X series. both the X (Nina) and Zero (Ace) analogues are fun to play and remind you very much do how X and Zero controlled in the early MMX games. The music and sound effects add a lot to the nostalgia of the experience, and fit nicely with the aesthetic of the game.\n\nOverall it's well worth it's price of entry for anyone into Mega Man or old school platforming, and fans of the Mega Man and X series will have a lot of fun here.

I think this is a fine game and it does feel pretty similar to controlling X complete with charge shots, dash jumping, and wall kicking.  Like Megaman X, the game has 8 boss levels before a couple finale levels.  However, these initial levels will need to be replayed over and over and over in order to have a shot at the finale levels.  There is a very small number of unlockables which makes the roguelite part feel unnecessary and repetitive.  Most upgrades are stat boosts which leads to very similar runs unlike many other roguelites which provide different experiences each time.  On top of that, the early first 6-7 boss levels are pushovers before having a huge difficulty spike that depends heavily on your luck with drops whether it is possible to continue on in the run.  Overall, this isnt a terrible game but with the lack of content it would have been much better as a standard single play game instead of a roguelite which gets too repetitive quickly.

I haven't even played yet tried the second character yet (Zero-type).\n\nPros:\n1.  It controls very well.  For example, the dash, wall jump, etc. all feel totally natural.  It does all the fundamental things a good platforming game like this should.\n2.  The weapons, upgrades, and enemies all vary nicely.  \n3.  While it is challenging (I played on the normal difficulty, but there are easy and hard modes), it doesn't lean on annoying death traps to make the game feel longer than it really is; when you take damage or die, it feels like your own fault.\n4.  The difficulty curve is great as you progress through the game.\n5.  The rogue-like aspects are a lot of fun and give it a lot of replayability.  They don't feel tacked on and give you a lot of choice in how you build your attributes.  This adds a lot to the Mega Man-ish formula, more than I thought it would.\n6.  It has an interesting and attractive visual style.\n\nCons:\nReally the only bad thing I can say about it is a minor quibble.

Megaman X defined my childhood. Still, 20XX falls short. The procedural level element works fine, but comments about each level feeling \"samey\" ring true. Whenever you sign a contract with The Procedural Devil, it comes with a set of pretty standard drawbacks. If you ever suffered under No Man's Sky, you understand how barren it can feel even when surrounded by abundance. 20XX emulates this feeling when the same enemies appear in each level.\n\nSecond, for a roguelike game, I believe 8 bosses is too few to provide the variability and diversity required for sustained replayability. I loved defeating my first boss, walking into the reward room, and seeing 3 fresh Bosses to choose from. \"Wow!\" I thought. 2 runs later, I was already growing tired of running through the stages to fight bosses that were, unfortunately, well designed aesthetically, but less inspired when it came to difficulty and weapon design. If you ever played the later installments of the X series, you know how laughable some of the powers got and how unrewarding they felt to use. Shooting, literally, a giant blue square, is dumb. This is what the dragon boss in this game rewards you with. Not a flamethrower, not some cool flying dash move....you shoot a giant blue square.\n\n\nDon't get me wrong--there's a lot of potential for this game with an expansion or sequel. *The bones are good*. The gameplay is smooth, the artwork gorgeous, and the intentions well-made.

Dashing and wall climbing feel crisp, clean and fantastic. Feels so great to plow through a level smoothly, when you can make it happen. \n\nPlayed alot of online co-op in this and it's great.

Mega Man style powers up, controls, and weapons. But Rogue Legacy randomness and getting some permanent upgrades between runs.\n\nThe only thing that isn't randomly generated is the power up that a boss drops, that's fixed. Outside of that it's allllll random. Level order? Random. Item drops? Random. Stats upgrades? Random. Level layout? Random.\n\nNow, it isn't a strict random, it's more that the level layout has a few major sections that select from a group. So you will see the same layouts appear many many times. What keeps it fresh is the enemy and hazards within that layout.\n\nSure I'll have seen these 5 platforms before, but I didn't see them dipping down into a laser beam, with vertical lazers between each of them making my jumps a lot harder.\n\nOh look. Different level, those same 5 platforms. But they vanish this time, and I have fireballs blasting up where I need to jump.\n\nIt would be nice for there to be more variety in the fixed platform layouts, but that in no way detracts from an amazing game.\n\nI use an XBox 360 controller for windows, I don't know how I would play this game without one. Or at least without another controller. I would not advise anyone to try this game just with the keyboard.\n\n\nEDIT:\n\nAn addition to the review. Higher difficulties alter level layouts, adding a LOT more complexity and making it a lot harder to avoid damage. So you may not even recognise the similar layouts due to the addition of so many traps. So my biggest complaint in wanting more variety is already answered in what the higher difficulties provide.\n\nHowever, some of the boss powers are able to manipulate the environment, able to prevent some of the 'traps' from working. I won't say what or how to not spoil it. But it really adds more strategy to what powers to take from what bosses.\n\nI've also been really enjoying running the daily challenge.

At first I thought I was going to play this game and be disappointed after a little while, but before I knew it 4 hours had passed and I had not yet beaten it. Another 5 hours later I managed to finally beat the game, and I was ready to quit, but I realized I still had many other things in game to unlock to power me up more. I am 11 hours into this game and I have to admit it is far more addictive than what I thought it would be originally.\n\nPros: \nRandom level patterns smushed together for interesting layouts\nEnemies slowly gain strength as you progress\nItems are random and MANY combinations work well together (I almost never collect powers, always grab me nuts for more items)\nBosses and enemies are tiered pretty fairly and never seem to overpower you\nUse of a controller makes the game a cakewalk (though you should remap your keyboard and gamepad, the default button layout sucks horribly)\nMusic is very reminiscent of the SNES Megaman games I miss\nOnline play is pretty dope, though only using emojis to communicate is pretty annoying\n11 hours in and I am still sure there is a ton of stuff to unlock\n\nCons:\nSometimes trap timing is nearly impossible to get through without a lot of speed or jumping/flying past everything\nSome enemy attacks glitch through walls making it hard to dodge when you are cornered\nSometimes you wont find a health station for 3-4 levels\nMost of the powers are useless, seriously, use the reflect shield or dragons power, the others are too crummy in comparision\nAce has terrible attacks, yet everyone wants to use him online\nNo quick save for resuming later\nSome platform glitching has killed me numerous times dropping through the base of them\n\nSummary:\nI don't normally leave reviews, but this is something I think anyone who likes to test their skill will enjoy, it's great for long or short play sessions.

Desarrollado por el estudio independiente Batterystaple Games, estaba en early access desde noviembre de 2014, pero fue el pasado 16 de agosto cuando por fin sali\u00f3 de esa etapa ya como juego terminado.\n\nTiene 2 personajes disponibles para jugar, Nina, a distancia (inspirada claramente en Megaman) y Ace, a mel\u00e9 (inspirado en Zero). Con ambos deberemos avanzar por diferentes niveles cargados acci\u00f3n y plataformas, solos o en coop. hasta llegar al jefe final de cada uno de estos. Hay muchos elementos que cambian la jugabilidad, ya sea con mejoras activas a nuestras habilidades o bien bien por elementos de los escenarios, en los cuales tambi\u00e9n hay bastantes secretos y much\u00edsimas referencias a Megaman y al mundo del videojuego en general.\n\nSobre los toques roguelite que mencionaba al principio, consisten en que si morimos tocar\u00e1 empezar desde la base, lugar donde gestionamos todo (cambiamos de personajes, multijugador, comerciar, desaf\u00edos diarios/semanales etc), y los niveles tienen ciertos patrones que hacen que cambien seg\u00fan el momento en el que accedas a ellos. Es decir, cuando comienzas puede aparecerte cualquier nivel y luego al terminarlo ya podemos elegir cualquiera de los restantes, el caso es que seg\u00fan los niveles terminados que llevemos, el siguiente que toque cambiar\u00e1 para hacerse m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil en forma de plataformas m\u00e1s complejas, m\u00e1s enemigos, boss con m\u00e1s vida etc. Osea que un nivel concreto al que accedamos tras acabar 1 2 o los que sean antes de ese, ser\u00e1 m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil y diferente que si ese mismo nivel es nuestro primer nivel, no s\u00e9 si me explico, pero dicho sistema es muy simple de entender al jugar. Y luego por supuesto tenemos el desbloqueo de mejoras permanentes o seleccionables al empezar cada nueva run, t\u00edpicas de los roguelites.\n\nTodo esto adem\u00e1s aderezado con la posibilidad de poder jugarlo en multiplayer, ya sea en local en tu casa con otro amigo o en l\u00ednea. Su apartado sonoro tambi\u00e9n es bastante bueno, evocando a aquellas \u00e9pocas de Megaman. A poco que os guste las plataformas y la acci\u00f3n, los rogue lites o Megaman (por supuesto), os lo recomiendo bastante. Y tiene un precio muy econ\u00f3mico de 15 eurillos, para un juego que tiene much\u00edsimo contenido y es un tributo al m\u00edtico juego de Capcom.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1503932569, "timestamp_updated": 1503932569, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.615385", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34545662": {"recommendationid": "34545662", "author": {"steamid": "76561198107153265", "num_games_owned": 370, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 530, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503746489}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u548c\u57fa\u53cb2\u4e2a\u4eba\u6253\u5b8c\u666e\u901a\u6a21\u5f0f\u5c31\u6ca1\u6709\u5728\u73a9\u4e86\uff0c\u7ed9\u60f3\u4e70\u7684\u4eba\u70b9\u4fe1\u606f\n\n\u6298\u540e15\u5143\u5de6\u53f3\uff0c\u4e14\u6709\u57fa\u53cb\u4e00\u8d77\u73a9\uff0c\u63a8\u8350\uff0c\u5426\u5219\u4e0d\u63a8\u8350\n\n\u753b\u9762\uff1a\u6211\u53ea\u80fd\u8bf4\u5f88\u4e00\u822c\uff0c\u4e0d\u591f\u7cbe\u81f4\n\n\u97f3\u4e50\uff1a\u5370\u8c61\u4e0d\u6df1\u523b\n\n\u64cd\u4f5c\uff1a\u8fd9\u4e2a\u5012\u662f\u4e0d\u9519\uff0c\u5f88\u8212\u670d\uff0c\u624b\u611f\u548c\u6d1b\u514b\u4eba\u6ca1\u5dee\n\n\u96be\u5ea6\uff1a\u4e3b\u8981\u4f53\u73b0\u5728\u8dd1\u56fe\u4e0a\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u8bf4\u4e2a\u522b\u51e0\u4e2a\u5730\u5f62\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u6b7b\u4e2a\u51e0\u6b21\u5c31\u597d\u4e86\uff0c\u6709\u4e862\u6bb5\u8df3\u4e4b\u540e\u53ef\u4ee5\u8d70\u5f88\u591a\u975e\u5e38\u89c4\u8def\u5f84\n\n\u53ef\u73a9\u6027\uff1a\u62b1\u6b49\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u662frouge\u7684\u597d\u4f5c\u54c1\u592a\u591a\u4e86\uff0c\u8fd9\u6b3e\u901a\u5173\u540e\u5b8c\u5168\u6ca1\u6709\u7ee7\u7eed\u73a9\u4e0b\u53bb\u7684\u6b32\u671b\uff0c\u5c0f\u602a\u5c31\u90a3\u4e48\u51e0\u79cd\uff0cboss\u5b8c\u5168\u56fa\u5b9a\uff0c\u5730\u56fe\u867d\u7136\u662f\u968f\u673a\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u5730\u5f62\u7ec4\u5408\u5c31\u90a3\u4e48\u51e0\u79cd\uff0c\u9053\u5177\u5b8c\u5168\u6ca1\u6709\u65b0\u610f\n\n\u552f\u4e00\u52a0\u5206\u9879\uff1a\u53ef\u4ee5\u8054\u673a\u4e92\u5751\n\n\u4e2a\u4eba\u5c0ftips\uff1a\u89d2\u8272\u63a8\u8350\u59b9\u5b50\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5f88\u591aboss\u5bf9\u8fd1\u6218\u592a\u4e0d\u53cb\u597d\u4e86\uff1b\u526f\u6b66\u5668\u653b\u51fb\u5411\u63a8\u8350\u51b0\u5757\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u84c4\u529b\uff0c\u653b\u51fb\u8ddd\u79bb\u8fdc\uff0c\u8303\u56f4\u5927\uff0c\u4f24\u5bb3\u9ad8\uff0c\u9632\u5fa1\u5411\u63a8\u8350\u73af\u7ed5\u706b\u7403\uff0c\u62b5\u6321\u5c0f\u51b0\u5757\u4e0d\u6d88\u8017\uff08\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u662f\u4e0d\u662fbug\uff09\uff1b\u9053\u5177\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u5927\u4e8e\u87ba\u4e1d\uff0c\u87ba\u4e1d\u540e\u671f\u57fa\u672c\u90fd\u662f\u6ea2\u51fa\u7684\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e86\u5546\u5e97\u5c31\u662f\u4e70\u4e70\u4e70", "timestamp_created": 1503899177, "timestamp_updated": 1503899177, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34545514": {"recommendationid": "34545514", "author": {"steamid": "76561198211053815", "num_games_owned": 21, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 183, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506137532}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u56e0\u4e3a\u770b\u753b\u98ce\u6709\u70b9\u50cf\u4ee5\u524d\u7684\u6d1b\u514b\u4eba\u7cfb\u5217\u4e8e\u662f\u4fbf\u4e70\u4e86\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u8fd9\u6e38\u620f\u6ca1\u6709\u5267\u60c5\u95ef\u5173\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u53ea\u6709\u7adf\u901f\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u53ea\u8981\u4f60\u95ef\u5173\u4e2d\u9014\u5931\u8d25\u4f60\u524d\u9762\u6253\u7684\u9053\u5177\u5168\u90e8\u6e05\u96f6\u91cd\u65b0\u6765\u8fc7\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6211\u8fd9\u79cd\u624b\u6b8b\u515a\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u7b80\u76f4\u662f\u5669\u68a6\u4e00\u822c.", "timestamp_created": 1503898318, "timestamp_updated": 1503898318, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.460076", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34544928": {"recommendationid": "34544928", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994913440", "num_games_owned": 1038, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 805, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504431669}, "language": "english", "review": "I never would have expected Megaman X and rogue gameplay to combine so well.

In fact, it so blantently wears these inspirations you'd be forgiven for thinking it IS a Megaman game.  The gimmick here, if you will, is the addition of rogue-like features which means that the levels, powerups and enemies are randomized every playthrough.  At it's core it's pretty much like being able to play a greatest hits remix of all the Megaman games every time you play.  Find a particular run you liked?  Keep the seed and play it as much as you want.  Tired of that?  Play randomized games until you've had your fill.  It's simple, it's fun and it's well made.  I recommend it to any platformer (and especially Megaman/Megamax X fans) enthusiast, and that's all you need to know unless you want to read my critical thoughts below:\n\nThe roguelike is pretty standard, you find powerups that change your weapon and armor, but also boosts to your stats such as speed, jump, normal and special attacks.  These changes can make a big difference in how you play through the levels and definitely reduces the 'repetitive' nature of the game.  I'm really, really surprised at how natural it ends up feeling.  However, it's also at odds with aspects such sub weapons being stronger against some bosses.  In my experience it didn't matter because powering up your weapon and just using charge shots, especially when paired with some other particularly devestating abilities, is generally good enough.  This is probably because the enemy boss AI is pretty weak overall and just aren't interesting to fight, they get more challenging as time goes on but I died far more on the platforming than boss fights, by a margin of 15:1 I'd wager.  And there are ten bosses total, which is a fine number, but given the game is randomized each time it would be nice if they outnumbered the levels.\n\nThe gameplay is decent enough it could hold its own without the rougelike gimmick at all, and the random generation is the weakest, or at least less interesting, part of the game.  It works, and I'll be honest, it works a whole hell of a lot better than it probably should, but it's just constructing levels of varying length out of a toolbox of pieces and that box isn't terribly deep.  Each piece seems to be able to change based on how far you are in the game to make sure later levels are harder, but you will come to recognize them within a dozen play throughs.  It doesn't help that each 'kit' is shared among 2 bosses and that means there seems to be 5 level sets to build the ten stages from.  It a nice touch but the lack of a human spark along with the decidedly repetitious use of these pieces means it does little to actually delay the inevitable feelings of sameness, and makes the lack of diversity stand out more.\n\nThat may all seem too critical because as I said, the gameplay is pretty spot on and it's tons of fun.  At this pricepoint these are minor gripes at worst, and given Capcom's latest Megaman offerings, Batterystaple should be commended on bringing us exactly what we've been waiting years for: a meaty, straight-forwards Megaman platformer with a roguelike twist.

While this game is definitely worth the $15 price, I've seen negative reviews from players who did not read the description, or simply don't know what a roguelite entails. Maybe it's silly to hope that they'll read the reviews by chance, but it's worth a shot.\n\n[h1] Roguelite Details [/h1]\n\n  20XX has permadeath, which means you have to beat all 8 \"robot masters\" and the two Sigma-esque stages with their respective bosses all in one go. This will be a lot trickier than normal, since the levels are generated using hand designed segments, so memorizing the levels isn't an option. To compensate for this, there's a variety of powerups that you can receive along the way which will make the trip easier, and they are [i]much[/i] more powerful than you would fine in an X game. You'll be receiving large boosts to your damage, speed, jump heigh, health, and max energy. There are also more unique powerups, like shooting through walls, different busters/blades, a front facing dash shield, etc. In addition, pits and spikes do not instakill you, so don't worry about that.\n\n   Progression works a bit differently as well, since you're intended to die/win and repeat the experience over and over again. During a run through the levels, you'll occasionally find glowing enemies which are a lot tankier than their normal variants. When you kill these enemies, you gain soul chips, which allow you to unlock power ups which will show up in future runs. If you have unlocked all the power ups, you can still use soul chips to bring 3 of them with you into a run, prevent power ups from showing up at all that run, or buy tokens to hopefully get more power ups from slot machines sometimes found at the end of a level.\n\n[h1] Other Differences [/h1]\n\n   Ace, the not-Zero, plays a little bit differently when you're using his default saber. Instead of the having a variety of slashes like air slash, rolling slash, dash slash, etc, you simply have access to the triple slash combo [b]everywhere[/b]. You can triple slash when standing still, while dashing, while jumping, while wallclimbing, you can use it absolutely anywhere. If you want the rolling air slash (understandable), you can find it as an alternative weapon called the Spinning Glaive. Both the not-X and not-Zero character have alternate weapons to find, so try them all out and see which fits you best.\n\n   The movement in 20XX is very similar to Mega Man ZX. You can dash and turn around while still maintaining the dash speed, and you go straight up when you walljump instead of slightly off the wall (though the straight walljump was a glitch in ZX). In addition, you can hold the dash button to dash jump or dash walljump without actually performing a dash, like in X4 onwards. Other than that, it's not too different from a standard X game until you start getting the power ups that increasing your speed, increasing your jump height, or give you additional abilities like air dash and double jump.\n\n   Another big change to the formula would be the co-op. If you're playing local co-op, the camera will pan out to show both of you, and if you're playing online co-op, you get your own separate screens. Both characters have their own iframes against bosses, so both players can wail on a boss at the same time without getting in the way of each other. Finally, you have an emote wheel and a teleport feature which you can use by not selecting an emote for roughly 3 seconds\n\n   Finally, you have the boss powers. When you beat a boss, you have the option to pick between its power, some money (usable at shops), or a power up. You have access to all boss powers you've picked up in the pause menu, but you can bind three of them to buttons, so unless you have the power cycling option on, you no longer have to deal with clumsily flipping through your powers. All powers share the same energy meter, but they also only consume one energy per use.\n\n[h1]Is it worth it?[/h1]\n  \n   I definitely have gotten far more than 15 dollars worth out of this game.

I've been a lifelong fan of the series and this is basically a Megaman game with insane replayability and an excellent degree of challenge. This is the game I (and probably you) have been waiting for. The most important point for me is that the controls feel instantly responsive and mowing through enemies feels just as incredible as in those other games, if not better.  You can effectively play as Megaman or Zero, and both have their own different weaponry to choose from, and the randomized elements make each run (around 50 minutes long) a new experience, and keep things fresh. You can expand your potential pool of powerups in game by earning currency in-game, so the breadth and variety of the game continues to grow as you unlock more and more. For those desiring more difficulty, there are around 14 toggleable settings that make it more challenging. Either way, the permadeath makes everything instantly higher stakes and much more exciting when you're low on health.\n\nSeriously, if you're still reading this and hesitating and are at ALL a fan of Megaman or like twitchy skill-based action platformers in general, I implore you to throw out that hestiation and give it a shot.

If you like roguelikes but are unfamiliar with Mega Man, you are this game's intended audience. But, if you came here as a MMX fan and are expecting a more classic experience, you *may* find the roguelike elements getting in the way of your enjoment.\n\nTo start, in order to make the roguelike portion of this game work, some factors of classic Mega Man design were inadvertent casualties.\n\nOne of those is exploration. As the levels are procedurally generated, there are no Metroidvanian moments. Say in Mega Man X, you climb up a wall in Flame Mammoth's stage, see an Energy Tank behind a strange barrier of blocks, and you can't do anything to get it. But fear not, once you obtain that helmet upgrade, you can come back and claim it later.\n\nThis doesn't happen in 20XX because A. There is no backtracking to previous levels, and B. All of your items are random. You may never obtain the hover boots in a run, for instance. You might get the flight or double jump boots instead, but because you cannot plan around obtaining gear at certain stages, you also can't design cool moments around an upgrade's specific capabilities.\n\nFlight, double jump, hover boots, air dash boots. The most flavor you get out of those is the synergy between them and other upgrades or boss powers, like the boss power that launches a giant projecile that inherits your momentum, or the hover boots allowing you to spam your spinning air attack. While these are undoubtedly cool, I would have preferred to customize my character at my leisure, as opposed to when the stars align.\n\nIn the end, it feels like all items in the game are centered around a single purpose - boost your level clear times by increasing your mobility, offense and defense. There are other, weird upgrades you can choose to take or not, (like lose all max HP but 1, and convert the lost HP into temporary HP that's twice as strong) but they feel more like gimmicks than compelling choices. \n\nWhat's more, you are expected to grow in power as you progress, but this comes at the cost of feeling \"off\" at the beginning of the game. You feel slow, your dash barely moves you forward, and your jumps are short. But as you upgrade, you turn into a speed demon with omnidirectional air dash and insane jump height. It's awesome, but I felt the power spikes were too drastic. I hated the feeling of deprivation at the start of the game more than the power I got at the end of the game. I didn't get this feel of deprivation with Mega Man X. You get your single power spike from the dash upgrade, and the rest is more flavorful as opposed to game-changing.\n\nPersonally, I fail to see what positives roguelike randomization brings to the game as opposed to what you have to give up to get it. Obtaining gear through a shop feels hollow. Procedural generation means levels aren't memorable. The ever-present timer at the bottom of the screen pushes you to rush through a level instead of taking your time. But this may differ depending on your tastes. Some people enjoy getting through the game with whatever gear they find, and skillfully adapt on the fly to new challenges. Speed is a priority. Exploration and backtracking are secondary to achieving a high score on the leaderboard. If that sounds appealing to you, check this game out.\n\nI have to give kudos where they are due, and that is to the art and sound teams, as the character designs, effects, movement and controls, music and even the story are top notch. Unfortunately, the roguelike elements jarred me a bit too much to fully recommend this game to players outside of a roguelike-loving audience.", "timestamp_created": 1503681782, "timestamp_updated":

A game that was supposed to revive the spirit of Mega Man, a franchise of which I've played almost all games that came out for Gameboy and SNES. \nAfter playing a bit of  20XX, I made the decision to refund the game. It is not a bad game per se, it just it not what was promised. Sure, it looks a lot like Mega Man, but what matters here is gameplay. The controls are not as crisp as they should be and the level design -due to randomization- simply does not hold up. Cheesy Robot-Bosses aside, level design was the true strength of both Mega Man and Mega Man X, while this game creates weird half-heights and extremely repetitive sections in its levels. \nIf you did not come for the Mega Man nostalgia, but for a decent rogue-lite platformer, you might find some satisfaction with the game. However, when compared to genre greats like Rogue Legacy or Spelunky it still falls short for similar reasons (level design, controls).\n\n\nMaybe I'll give the game another chance when it is on sale in a few years, but for now I simply can not recommend it due to the misleading advertisment and somewhat disappointing gameplay.

If you are or were a fan of Mega Man X, you will be a fan of this game. The game features our two heroes, Ace and Nina. Nina is the blue bomber of the duo with her blaster and blue suit, Ace is the swordmaster of the duo with his laser saber (other types of melee weapons are available). The progression of the game features 9 procedurally generated levels with a boss at the end. After the boss, you receive a choice of either a weapon related to the boss you defeated, currency to be used in the levels, or a power up for your run. Soul chips you collect throughout your run can be used after you finish to buy a larger item pool or options for each run and permanent upgrades for each run that can be turned on or off. You may also buy powerups from a choice of 3 for your next run.\n\nGraphics/Art:\n   20XX stems from the art of the SNES era with being pixels and 2D, but I step up from old SNES era games. The art style is satisfactory and has a semblence of it's spiritual predecessor with using robots for 90% of everything in the game, this includes taking animals and using a robot twist.\n   Where I believe could have been improved on the art is the impact of the armor sets. On my first few runs of getting armor, I had no idea that my looks actually changed. I would recommend changing the color hue or making more drastic distinctions between each armor set. If you look at megaman, he is almost completely blue, so the introduction of a white/larger armor feels like a significant change. While Nina and Ace include multiple colors by design, the aquiring of new armor doesn't change the colors or overall feeling of complexity in the armor.\n   Still, this is very nitpicky, the overall feeling of the style is very spot on.\n   Quick extra note, the cutscenes could use some touching up and seem very rigid. They feel more of a slideshow over a cutscene. Seeing the addition of something more fluid and comprehensible would be great.\n\nMusic:\n   No complaints, music is great and have nostalgic feelings of its blue predecessor.\n\nMechanics:\n   Controls feel very tight. The following mechanics are present from the beginning for each run: jumping, dashing, shooting, gripping the wall, and charging (for stronger shots). One of the techniques that must be learned very quick is the jump dash, which is just a combination of the two. Most deaths in this game feel like a fault of the player's skill, not the game. There are only a few cases where I felt the game was at fault, but that is not from the mechanics, but how the stage was set up.\n\nStages:\n   The stages are procedurally generated and include a myriad of obstacles and hoops to jump through: moving platforms, stationary lasers, spikes, pitfalls, various enemies, and ice. Most stages feel like a floating platform in an open space rather than something like a closed tunnel. As it is, I think that the variety between the levels is not vast enough in terms of it's aesthetic appeal. Many of the stages include similar mechanics in each one with a different palette hue between them. The only differentiator in this is the ice which is isolated to the ice level. Take this with a grain of salt, each level is still fun and great to play and this is a great base to start from and as this game grows, this could easily change.\n\nProgression:\n   As the game progresses, you will find powerups and new pieces are armor that give you the feeling of growing stronger while at the same time, not completely breaking the mold. They do allow you to bend the rules, but not break them. Examples of this are getting stronger so you one shot enemies or getting boots that double jump. Powerups can range from simple extra attack to receiving bonuses for mismatching armor pieces.\n   One of the best cases in progression does not actually come from the player, but actually from the stages and bosses. As you progress through the game, you will find that the enemies change colors and their design includes more features to show greater strength. Platforming and jumping puzzles become faster and start to include more features. Bosses also become faster, stronger, and some of them include different mechanics that are unlocked at reaching a life threshold. For example, there is a mole(?) boss that rides a wheel with blades, if you fight him early it's a straighforward fight, but if you fight him later, after you beat him he splits into two smaller versions of himself that you have to beat. This is a great example of progression and I hope the developer continues this trend, either building the game more horizontally, with more bosses, obstacles, traps, etc, or vertically, pushing the game past 9 stages in some way.\n\nMultiplayer:\n   As a reference, I have tried only the local co-op two player mode. I don't know if there are other modes, but this is the one I tried. In a word, it's great. Both players share currency items and upgrades double spawn for each player, including the boss rewards. The camera pulls out further depending on how far each player is from each other. I prefer this to something like split screen because it is less jarring on transition and feels like more a gradual transition. Although, if it were possible, I wish that the player could choose to either have a slow pull out or a transition to split screen on camera threshold.\n   Other details, if your partner dies you will have a chance to revive them at points in each levels for a certain amount of your health. For the upgrades, some of them apply to each person on one person picking it up, so only one person needs to do a platforming section, but sometimes, depending on the upgrade (like armor), both will have to pick it up.\n\nClosing:\n   20XX is a great throwback and has tons of potential for the future. You can play it with your friends and family in local co-op quite easily. The progression is great in both the player and their surroundings. The game includes a decent amount of content warrant for a purchase. The greatest strength for this game is in its design, it is a great base from which to build upon. If the developer adds and updates this game, you could easily see more characters, mechanics, powers, bosses, etc.\n   The art style could use some work as well as some of the aethetics of the game to feel more distinct between stages.

I originally bought it from the devs 2 years ago and this game has come a loonnnnnggg way since then.  Basic gameplay loop is you play a round, die and spend chips on item pool unlocks (a la Binding of Isaac) or permanent upgrades (a la Rogue Legacy).  It does a good job of having that \"just one more run\" feel.\n\nThe good:\n+ Runs are varied. Sometimes I focused on normal attack power, other times I focused on special weapon abilities, another run I was a tank.  Each run changes up strategies.\n+ Boss weapons have affects on the environment (like disabling traps).\n+ Made me want to play MMX.\n+ Addicting as hell.\n+ Bosses are awesome.  The boss room level lay out and attack patterns change depending on when you play them.  If you play them on the first level they're pretty easy. But play the same boss on level 6 the room layout will be completely different and the boss can be quite challenging.\n\nThe bad:\n- Not as refined or polished as other games in the genre.\n- I personally think that some of the permanent upgrades are OP and make the game really easy. These can be turned off though.\n- Some bosses cause the screen to be zoomed out which is disorienting considering 99% of the game is a fixed zoom level. This one is personal.\n- Some hard to reach areas do not have any reward and are just dead ends.\n- Moving platforms move comically too fast or too slow sometimes.\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend checking this game out, especially if you've been looking for a new MM game.", "timestamp_created": 1503616410, "timestamp_updated": 1503620022, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.644398", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34469419": {"recommendationid": "34469419", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075514690", "num_games_owned": 32, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3672, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512905611}, "language": "japanese", "review": "2\u5e749\u30f6\u6708\u306e\u30a2\u30fc\u30ea\u30fc\u30a2\u30af\u30bb\u30b9\u671f\u9593\u3092\u7d4c\u3066\n\u9042\u306b\u6b63\u5f0f\u7248\u516c\u958b\u3001\u304a\u3081\u3067\u3068\u3046\u3054\u3056\u3044\u307e\u3059\uff01\n\n[h1]\u307e\u305a\u9593\u9055\u3044\u306a\u304f\u4fa1\u683c\u4ee5\u4e0a\u306e\u4fa1\u5024\u306f\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\uff01[/h1]\n\n\u30ea\u30b9\u30da\u30af\u30c8\u5143\u3067\u3042\u308b\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u30de\u30f3X\u3092\u307b\u307c\u5168\u9762\u7684\u306b\u51cc\u99d5\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u306e\u306b\u52a0\u3048\n\u30fb(\u30ed\u30fc\u30ab\u30eb/\u30aa\u30f3\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3)Coop\n\u30fb\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8\u30e9\u30f3\u30c0\u30e0\u751f\u6210\n\u30fb\u30ed\u30fc\u30b0\u30e9\u30a4\u30af\u8981\u7d20\n\u30fb\u7d30\u304b\u3044\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30de\u30a4\u30ba\n\u30fb\u30c1\u30e3\u30ec\u30f3\u30b8\u8981\u7d20\n\u30fb\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8\u306e\u30ae\u30df\u30c3\u30af\u653b\u7565\u3068\u76f8\u6027\u304c\u826f\u3044\u30dc\u30b9\u30d1\u30ef\u30fc\u8981\u7d20\n\u306a\u3069\u3001\u7d20\u6674\u3089\u3057\u3044\u8981\u7d20\u3092\u52a0\u3048\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\n\n\u305d\u308c\u306a\u306e\u306b\u3001\u52d5\u4f5c\u304c\u8efd\u5feb\u3067\u30af\u30e9\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u304c\u7121\u304f\n\u30c0\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u3001\u30b8\u30e3\u30f3\u30d7\u3001\u58c1\u8e74\u308a\u306e\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u304c\u9ad8\u3044\n\u3068\u3044\u3046\u5b8c\u6210\u5ea6\u306e\u9ad8\u3055\u304c\u826f\u3044\u3067\u3059\u306d\u3002\n\n\u30e9\u30f3\u30c0\u30e0\u751f\u6210\u3082\u3001\u3068\u3066\u3082\u3088\u304f\u6a5f\u80fd\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\n\u5358\u8abf\u306a\u30d6\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u304c\u898f\u5247\u6b63\u3057\u304f\u30de\u30b9\u76ee\u4e0a\u306b\u4e26\u3093\u3060\u308a\u3001\u5230\u9054\u4e0d\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u5834\u6240\u304c\u751f\u6210\u3055\u308c\u308b\u306a\u3069\n\u3068\u3044\u3046\u30cd\u30ac\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u306a\u3053\u3068\u306f\u3042\u308a\u307e\u305b\u3093\u3002\n(\u30c0\u30e1\u30fc\u30b8\u3092\u53d7\u3051\u308b\u30de\u30b0\u30de\u304c\u305b\u308a\u4e0a\u304c\u3063\u3066\u304f\u308b\u306a\u3069\u3082\u3042\u3063\u305f\u3089\u826f\u304b\u3063\u305f\u304b\u3082\u3057\u308c\u307e\u305b\u3093\u3002)\n\n\u30aa\u30fc\u30b0\u53ce\u96c6\u3084\u30c1\u30e3\u30ec\u30f3\u30b8\u3001Coop\u306a\u3069\u3084\u308a\u3053\u307f\u8981\u7d20\u3082\u5b8c\u5099\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\n\u79c1\u306f\u307e\u3060\u30aa\u30f3\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3Coop\u306f\u3084\u3063\u305f\u3053\u3068\u306a\u3044\u3067\u3059\u304c\u3001\n\u4ed6\u306e\u4eba\u306e\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u52d5\u753b\u898b\u308b\u3068\u666e\u901a\u306b\u3067\u304d\u3066\u305d\u3046\u3067\u3059\u3002\n\n\u3053\u306e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u304c\u597d\u304d\u306a\u306e\u3067\u3001\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u4f53\u9a13\u3092\u5c11\u3057\u3067\u3082\u3057\u3066\u304f\u308c\u308b\u4eba\u304c\u5897\u3048\u308b\u3088\u3046\n\u30dc\u30a4\u30b9\u30ed\u30a4\u30c9\u89e3\u8aac\u52d5\u753b\u3063\u307d\u3044\u3082\u306e\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3057\u3066\u307f\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\n\nyoutube https://youtu.be/ncXNoQfiMLg\n[url=http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm31804580]\u30cb\u30b3\u30cb\u30b3\u52d5\u753b[/url]  http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm31804580\n\n\u4eca\u5f8c\u306e\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30c7\u30fc\u30c8\u3082\u671f\u5f85\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1503615090, "timestamp_updated": 1503616052, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34468883": {"recommendationid": "34468883", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010972082", "num_games_owned": 100, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 677, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504746433}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing game.

I have been a Huge Mega Man fan for almost 25 years now.  And an even Bigger fan of Mega man X.  Especially the X games on the super Nintendo.  In my eyes, after X4 the games started going down hill.  This game, 20XX, is very similar to the X series the way I love them but it is not completely the same.  It feels much faster then the original X games.  In a lot of ways that is very good.  I love how I have to react really fast if I want to avoid getting hit.  There is A LOT more platforming in this game which is good and bad.  I love platforming but sometimes it is the only challenge ahead of you.  When there are obstacles to dodge and enemies coming at you WHILE platforming... the game becomes AWESOME!!!  I love the challenge of it.  Sometimes the bright colors of the enemy shots hide with the background (that's aggravating), but most the time there is no problem.  The game overall is really good!  I would recommend this game to any fan of the X series.  It's going to feel a little different but over all it is a breath of fresh air compared to any other Mega Man type games I've played.  \n\nThings I want out of the game is; More bosses!  Every time I do a run of the game I am facing the same bosses.  I love the idea of procedural games but you don't have to put all of the content in one run.  Have me face 8 bosses in one run and then some different bosses in another run.  Also, I would prefer different enemy types in every level.  Like, each enemy is themed to the stage they are in.  then during the \"Wily/Sigma\" stages you can combine them all to make it feel like you conquered these enemies before, now lets see what you learned, lol.  That would add a lot of variety to this game that I hope happens in the future.  Also, I feel as though the \"Zero\" character needs some work.  The game feels like it was designed for the \"X\" character because of the placement of the enemies with the platforming.  The \"Zero\" character has to put himself in way greater danger to hurt his foes.  I'd say make his sword more powerful against regular enemies and maybe be able to destroy enemy projectiles by slashing at them or something.  But hey, I'm only critiquing my opinions to make this GREAT game even better!  As it is right now, It's a Fantastic game when you play as the X character.  The leveling up of bosses is a great idea!  I just want more bosses. lol.  \n\nIf you are deciding if you should get this game and you are a fan of the SNES Mega Man X games, have no fear.  This game is for you and worth every penny.\n\nP.S.  I love how it has Co-op!  I never care if a game gets easier, harder, or just stays the same difficulty when playing 2 players.  People want to play with their friends!  This game did it right!  You might like it better on single player, but who cares! The option to play 2 players is there for you!", "timestamp_created": 1503544121, "timestamp_updated": 1503544121, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34451305": {"recommendationid": "34451305", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970951580", "num_games_owned": 55, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 248, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512265393}, "language": "english", "review": "This is what Mighty No. 9 should have been.

touch grazed my soul when I installed this game and played it from a friend's library for the first time, and I honestly believe my soul is nothing compared to this game's perfection.\n\nThis is a roguelike. Megaman X-styled. Randomly generated. Platformer. And it is absurdly good.\n\nIt has...very pleasing and simple graphics. Extremely tight controls that encourage both slow and fast playstyles. Very nice difficulty curve, it doesn't feel impossible right from the get-go like many other randomly generated roguelikes do. A very simple and progressive method of unlocking powerups that doesn't feel overly vague or too difficult, like the way TBoI handles it. And developers that actually listen to and interact with the community.\n\n...I'm serious, this is an absurdly good quality for a game to have. And it's uncommon, too, since Triple A developers sadly don't have the resources to do such a thing most of the time. It's one of the things that gives indie creators a lot of control with their games.\n\nAnd...I have to give some special attention to this game's music. I'm looking into composing music for video games myself, and oh my god, this game's music blows me out of the water. It's amazing. It really is perfect. It captures the classic Megaman feel, while also being its own totally different thing. It's among one of the best soundtracks I've heard, and I cannot stress that enough. It's so inspiring to me as a music creator myself. Whoever did the music, give yourself a pat on the back, buddy. You deserve it. And, actually, ALL of the devs, give yourselves pats on the back, since all of you worked together to make this wonderful game!\n\nOverall, I would totally reccommend this game. I would absolutely reccommend buying the soundtrack, too.

I thought this would play a bit more like Dead Cells, just with a Megaman vibe... however, I was wrong.[/h1]\n\nWhile I very much enjoy Dead Cells, 20XX lacks depth in just about every area. The main base/hub and items offered to the player does not feel like a progressive platform where you get better and more powerful and instead feels like a big happy-go-lucky megaman sandbox sidescroller. The UI and inventory also needs major work as most of the text is sort of painful to read and gather any real evidence that the player has accomplished anything. That's the only way I can basically put it unless you'd like to read more of my ranting.................\n\nOk... The only thing worth mentioning is the variety of bosses you're eventually able to face, however, what's upsetting is the repeditive gameplay and sluggish controls that I can only guess true hardcore classic megaman players will put up with. Being able to wall jump, dashing and moving in crazy acrobatic manuevers only to be limited to shoot in a straight line... This quickly becomes ever more frustrating when enemies are barely 2 pixels from being below or above you, thus forcing you to jump and time ever so accurately to lay a hit. While a majority of enemies die in 1 or 2 hits, some others take several or dozens while being placed in a helter-skelter fashion of the level with no spared expense of extra platforms to dash about to that may or may not dissipear. That being said, the platforming model used in this game is just a little too extreme and chaotic to say the least. A lot of the early levels I found myself in were full of slippery ICE blocks that are NOT forgiving whatsoever and become infuriating while you may just be trying to simply get back to where you were without being stabbed by spikes. Before you know it you are down to 1 health and then you slip off an edge, or maybe didn't see the upside down gravity walkway on the ceiling... While the levels are indeed random, they are not surprising or challenging and feel very linear, and even moreso annoying and easily able to make out chunks that you just witnissed in the last run. The level artwork, enemies and bosses are  well done and polished, although something about the actual player character design and story is just very cheesy and less polished and looks like it was designed in Adobe Flash a decade ago.", "timestamp_created": 1503291621, "timestamp_updated": 1503291621, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509870", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34387904": {"recommendationid": "34387904", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023031707", "num_games_owned": 369, "num_reviews": 129, "playtime_forever": 112, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509614824}, "language": "schinese", "review": "roguelike+\u6d1b\u514b\u4eba\u3002\u8e29\u5230\u523a\u4e0d\u4f1a\u79d2\u6740\uff0c\u5176\u5b9e\u662f\u6bd4\u6d1b\u514b\u4eba\u5bb9\u6613\u4e86\uff0c\u7ed9\u6211\u4eec\u624b\u6b8b\u7559\u4e86\u6761\u6d3b\u8def", "timestamp_created": 1503289927, "timestamp_updated": 1503289927, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34387866": {"recommendationid": "34387866", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989554549", "num_games_owned": 442, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 407, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503461160}, "language": "english", "review": "wow this game is amazing. likely the best indie game ive played-and I love ftl and hotline miami.

Anything Mega Man, I love. I saw this game and immediately wanted to buy it. \n\nThe clips I saw made it look incredible, but I was worried that it wouldn't play or feel as good as it looked. \n\nWell, worry not. This game is fucking amazing. It is SMOOTH, the controls are tight, you rarely feel like you're not in control of your character (except with insanely high run speed - but I'm bad lol) and one of the best things is, every run is different. Sure, there are the same bosses, same levels (More hazards do appear the later you do the levels, regardless of order so they are always increasing in difficulty) but I've had runs where I can steam roll bosses AND levels due to an armor set bonus, jump height and damage, then I've had runs where I can barely make it through the last level ! \n\nI'm waiting for this to stop being fun, but it keeps getting better. \n\nThis game is not only an amazing homage to Mega Man X games, but it's an amazing game in general. I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes Mega Man - but even if you just like platformers or \"roguelikes\" give it a shot. \n\ntwitch.tv/TrucktubGAMES", "timestamp_created": 1503270233, "timestamp_updated": 1503270233, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.613718", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34383905": {"recommendationid": "34383905", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021931423", "num_games_owned": 133, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 693, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503982312}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc815\uc2dd\ubc1c\ub9e4\ud6c4 \uad6c\ub9e4\ud588\ub294\ub370 \ucd1d 9\uac1c\uc758 \ub808\ubca8\ub85c \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc838 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4\n\uc81c \uc190\uc774 \uc7ad\uc2a4\uc778\uc9c0\ub77c \uc544\uc9c1 \uc77c\ubc18\ubaa8\ub4dc\ub97c \ubabb\uae7c\ub294\ub370 \uba54\uac00\ub9e8X\uc2dc\ub9ac\uc988\uc758 \ub2ec\uc778\uc774\ub77c\uba74 5\uc2dc\uac04 \uc548\uc5d0 \uc77c\ubc18\ubaa8\ub4dc \uae68\uc2e4\uc218\ub3c4 \uc788\uaca0\ub124\uc694\n\uadf8\ub7ec\uba74 \ud50c\ub808\uc774\uc2dc\uac04 \uc9e7\uc740\uac70 \uc544\ub2c8\ub0d0? \ub77c\uace0 \ud558\uc2e4\uc218\ub3c4 \uc788\ub294\ub370 \uc774\uac70 \ucee8\ud2b8\ub864\uc774 \uc815\ub9d0 \uc644\ubcbd\ud558\uace0\uc694 \uba40\ud2f0\ub3c4 \ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4 \n\uac04\ub9cc\uc5d0 \uba54\uac00\ub9e8X \uc2dc\ub9ac\uc988\uc758 \ud5a5\uc218\ub97c \ub290\ub07c\uba70 \uc815\ub9d0 \uc7ac\ubc0c\uac8c \ud588\ub124\uc694 \uc74c\uc545\ub3c4 \uc544\uc8fc \ud6cc\ub96d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4\n\n\uac8c\ub2e4\uac00 \ud55c\uae00\ub3c4 \uc644\ubcbd\uc9c0\uc6d0\uc778\ub370 \ub354\uc774\uc0c1 \ubb58 \ub9dd\uc124\uc774\uc2ed\ub2c8\uae4c??\n\n\uacb0\ub860: \uba54\uac00\ub9e8X\uc2dc\ub9ac\uc988\uc758 \ud32c\uc774\ub77c\uba74 \uc9c0\uae08 \ub2f9\uc7a5 \uc9c8\ub7ec \ub878\uc787 \ub098\uc6b0", "timestamp_created": 1503269602, "timestamp_updated": 1503269687, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34383389": {"recommendationid": "34383389", "author": {"steamid": "76561198110847648", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2030, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1514221510}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]Easy recommendation for everyone who likes action-platformers!!![/h1]\n\nyou don't even have to have played the MegaMan series to appreciate the level of polish and dedication the developers put into this well crafted piece of entertainment!\nwith the controls being as tight and precise as one could hope for,the platforming really is a blast to execute!\nthe weapons,powers and augmentations all feel meaningful and different enough to justify their existence in the game!\nthe currently very popular rogue-like formula, that got applied to sooo many games-but sooo few good ones,combined with classic 2d-action-platforming actually feels sensible and natural and lets you spend a ton of time with it without getting bored!\nstill...none of this would matter if the game isn't a joy to play.\nso i'm glad i can tell you this:\n\n[b]20XX IS FUN!!![/b]......it's that simple", "timestamp_created": 1503267465, "timestamp_updated": 1503267621, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506218", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34381847": {"recommendationid": "34381847", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017133746", "num_games_owned": 36, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2846, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 101, "last_played": 1514322445}, "language": "english", "review": "The year is 20XX.

It provides everything you would expect from a Megaman game (cool character/enemy/boss design, awesome music, tight controls, carefully crafted level design, various powers, etc.), but puts its own ideas into the mix as well, resulting in something that stands out from other Megaman clones. For example, being a rouge-like game, there is less focus on level memorization and more focus on quickly assessing any difficult situations that come up. This needs to be done well by the the player, as they only have one life and no continues. There's no need to fret though, as the game compensates for this difficulty in multiple ways. Pits and spikes, which are typically instant-kills in Megaman games, only take one unit of health in 20XX. It also incorperates an augment powerup system, so though the game may get more challenging as it goes on, the player continuously grows stronger. With enough time and a good run, the player can eventually become a near-unstoppable juggernaut (or, since the characters are robots, I guess it would be a juggerbot).\n\nIf you like Megaman, or even if you like action platforming in general, you will love 20XX.

Wer die Mega Man X Spiele mag, der kann hier definitiv nix falsch machen. Wer zudem noch gefallen an Rouge-like (oder eher lite) findet, der wird dieses Spiel lieben.\n\nAnfangs bin ich kaum weiter als Level 2 gekommen, doch nun schaffe ich es fast immer bis zum Ende (obwohl ich noch oft bei den neuen beiden Levels draufgehe, aber das wird sich mit der Zeit auch legen). Hier h\u00e4ngt viel vom eigenen k\u00f6nnen ab und nicht nur welche Items man findet, obwohl es nat\u00fcrlich viel einfacher ist, mit den richtigen Upgrades. Wei\u00df man erst mal wie sich die Levels zusammensetzen und welche Angriffsmuster die Gegner und besonders die Bosse haben, so wird man mit der Zeit von alleine immer weiter kommen. \n\nBesonders das Freischalten neuer Verbesserungen \u00fcber die gefundenen Soul Chips schaffen einen Anreiz immer wieder eine Runde zu spielen. Hat man erst einmal alles freigeschaltet, wird es aber auch nicht langweilig, da man durch die ganzen neuen Items eine gr\u00f6\u00dfere Varianz in die L\u00e4ufe bringt. Nat\u00fcrlich kann es auch passieren, dass man sich einen Run durch falsche Items versaut, aber auch hier lernt man mit der Zeit, wann es besser ist mal ein Upgrade einfach liegen zu lassen.\n\nAktuell hoffe ich, dass Level 9 noch ein bisschen angepasst wird, da mir dieses doch noch etwas unbalanciert wirkt, aber ansonsten kann ich das Spiel uneingeschr\u00e4nkt empfehlen.

It has some mega-man aesthetic with an art style akin to Brawlhalla. Platforming and movement controllers are tight, bosses get tough, and co-op adds another layer of chaos to a run. This game offers great incentive to come back and play more by offering permanent upgrades that are purchased using the harder to come by in-game currency (the longer you play the better permanent upgrades you can get) as well as allowing players to spend previously acquired currency on items to start the next run with. Since it allows you to start back at level 1 but maintain some upgrades that had been worked towards in previous runs as well as unlocking new items that will drop in the next run, the permadeath mechanic isn't so punishing that it would turn players away but adds the risk and difficulty that comes with a roguelike. Overall it is a great balance of generosity and challenge and offers smooth gameplay that works amazingly well at higher levels once the pace and difficulty begins to ramp up exponentially. \n\nThere are also various timed challenges you can complete daily, weekly, or at other intervals for more rewards and overall is a great package that allows for some of the most engaging roguelike platforming out there.", "timestamp_created": 1503138616, "timestamp_updated": 1503138616, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34346133": {"recommendationid": "34346133", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026410098", "num_games_owned": 195, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 847, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507719352}, "language": "english", "review": "Megaman X  and the Binding of Isaac conceived a wonderful child, \nAnd it was named 20XX.\nThe Township rejoiced and the infant was held high and paraded around town", "timestamp_created": 1503133320, "timestamp_updated": 1503133320, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.639214", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34344943": {"recommendationid": "34344943", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019926689", "num_games_owned": 607, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 141, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510453712}, "language": "english", "review": "Mighty No.9 raised over 4 million dollars.\n20XX raised a little over 20,000.\nIt's not how much money you have, but what you do with it that matters, clearly.\nVERY solid game that always gives you a new experience.

This balance of skill and unlocks already puts it way over so many other current rogue-likes that feel too reliant on random chance to get a good run rather than skill.\nI really dig the ability to turn off unlocks in each run to give a fun purist difficulty mode.\nThe weekly challenges, boss rush, and other modes are another really impressive addition.\nI haven't tried the multiplayer yet, but that's just another bonus mode on top of this already solid game.\n\nArt:\nI might be a bit biased on the art considering that I spent a lot of time on Newgrounds and Flashportal growing up, so if you can relate to that you'll probably also dig the style here.\n\nMusic:\nThe soundtrack is a small list of tracks, but none of them have gotten annoying to me after 4 runs.

A lot.\n\nIt is what it says on the tin: Come expecting Mega Man X style of gameplay, stay for the rogue-lite randomness and item pools. There's a good bit of variety and learning curve in the game, and the items and weapons feel pretty good once you're used to them. Aiming a couple of the boss weapons is incredibly unintuitive, but this game lends very well to experimenting with differnent things to get used to how they work.\n\n95% of my time so far was spent in the Beta, by the way (which was lovingly tended to for an incredible amount of time; This was a great example of Early Access Done Right even in the year of 2017). There's a lot of final touches I haven't seen yet that I'm sure I'm overlooking, but there's one particular pair of points I want to address.\n\nBy default, falling into bottomless pits won't kill you. This is good! It means you get to explore a bit and aren't heavily penalized for falling off of things. There's a lot of moving platforms, and a lot of enemies that fly, and you're not screwed just because something came on screen at the worst time. Falling into a pit seems to only ever deal 1 point of damage, and then resets you on the last bit of stable ground you were standing on. Fun!\n\n...until you get into the final levels. These are the Wily Stage equivalents; Utilizing everything you know and your best reflexes to topple challenges that expect you to be able to respond to them. That's where my biggest problem lies with this game. At the risk of sounding like a scrubby scrub who scrubs, the final bits feels overly reliant on platforming over bottomless pits with no solid land \"checkpoints.\" This isn't inherently bad, but if you're run didn't give you any kind of movement speed or maneuvering ability (double jumps, enhanced jumps, better dashes, whatever) you can feel unfairly penalized for not being able to move fast enough. I've had more than a few runs end because the spinning platforms were blocked by laser barriers flickering every half a second and my only way out was a series of temporary platforms (Mega Man WHOOOOOOMF blocks) that didn't match the timing on either the mobile platforms I had to maneuver through or the blinking laser barrier.\n\nLosing a ton of health because of \"difficulty\" isn't fun, and the final stages aren't particularly short! If you're lucky you'll get the tools to help you, but it does feel unfair at times due to the random pools of platforms and sequences.\n\nAs mentioned, I like this game a lot. I'd like it a lot more if I didn't have runs end simply because I dared to pick up certain upgrades, and as an effect I made the final platforming challenges nearly impossible. I'll continue to work on improving my own play in the meantime, but the combination of \"haha, you're too slooooow\" sections is a bummer.\n\nBuy and play this game.

If you are a fan of the X/Zero/ZX series, don't let the art style deter you. You are missing out on some great jump n' shootin'.\n\n20XX takes the fundamentals of the \"X\" series and puts it through the filter of a rogue-like. Movement, abilities, armors, bosses; it's all there. After about 10 minutes of playtime, veteran X players can rely on their muscle memory to make dash jumps and control their jump height. I was pleasantly surprised by how well they nailed the movement of the X games they are so clearly trying to emulate. The weapons the bosses give you have both applications in the stage and can be used as a weakness to a different boss. The armors that you find (I believe there are 3 total) rely on RNG to be discovered and purchased. They are not hidden away like the X games, but the abilities they give you are just as meaningful. It's almost like a \"best of\" armor pieces from X1-6, with a few new ideas in there as well. The bosses are also well designed and fun to fight. No spoilers, but, in particular, the final boss of this game in is fantastic. It really tests you on every aspect of the game in one fight, without feeling unfair.\n\nThe only deviations from the X formula are the tone of the story and graphical style, which may be a bit divisive. The story is rather tongue-in-cheek and the item and enemy descriptions are unabashedly self-aware. I'm not the biggest fan of this choice, but it conveys the love the creators have for the X series. Also, the graphics are.... different. Originally, the graphics were the biggest thing holding me back from purchasing the game back in 2015. They have definitely improved since then, but the bubbly look to the characters and their floaty looking animations turned me off at first. None of this translates to how the characters feel to control.\n\nFrankly, this is much better than anything Inti Creates has put out since the ZX series.

While collecting random power-ups to make yourself stronger is useful, it's ultimately your ability to play that will decide whether you succeed or fail. Not if you were lucky or not.\n\nDespite that, many level blocks that are randomly generated through level seeds, with random powerups and a large item pool to boot, each run will be a very unique challenge that you will have to tackle through and shouldn't get boring easily (I don't have over 300 hours for nothing).\n\nMake no mistake, this game doesn't not have any (real) permanent upgrade system. There's a couple permanent upgrades to help you out, but ultimately it is you as a gamer who is the one who will be challenged. Not how many stats you obtain on Nina, the Megaman X-esque character who blasts her foes away with a giant arm cannon, or Ace, the Zero-like man, who goes in slicing in dicing with saber like weapons... or axes... or spears... or glaives.\nThe one who gets stronger with each one will be YOU. The player. As your skills become more and more refined, you will find that each death will get further apart. You may die on level 3. And then level 4. Then level 6. Until eventually you get to the final challenge -- and probably die a few times there too. But each time you get there, you will get a little bit stronger, as you increase your arsenal of items you can find.\n\nAnd then when you finally beat the game, you look, to see all of these difficulty modifiers to challenge yourself even more, to make yourself even stronger as a player by handicapping yourself.

Based upon the gameplay of the classic series \"Megaman X\" for the Super Nintendo, 20XX procedurally generates levels based on level and biome. Each stage getting more difficult as you collect items that power-up your character.\n\nYou play as either Nina, a buster toting bombshell, or Ace, a blade-wielding melee fighter. Each character brings a different playstyle and quirks to the gameplay. The developer has expressed idea of more characters, but for now these two characters fill the roles of Megaman and Zero very well. The characters won't be lonely as you can also play couch multiplayer or online.\n\nNow for my review of the game. I'll be honest, I'm extremely biased. I've played this game for over 2 years both multiplayer and singleplayer. I love the game and everything about it, but here goes:\n\n[u][b]Gameplay:[/b][/u]\n\n20XX gameplays is just what you expect from a Megaman X game. Precise platforming with shooting and slashing. With the two characters you play as, both are extremely fun and rewarding to play as. They bring different playstyles as mentioned previously. Nina is safe with her ranged attacks but sacrifices damage, while Ace plays dangerously sacrificing safety for devastating melee attacks.\n\nThere are very few times you will feel that the game is unfair. The only times will occur when an enemy hits you off-screen. But, for the most part if you get hurt or fail, it's definitely your fault. The game has optional paths and challenges that rewards skillful play, and you feel extremely satisfied when you succesful navigate or blast your way through them.\n\nEvery run will be different from the last and you choose what you do depending on what the game gives you. Adaptability is a must with roguelike/roguelite games such as this one. However, 20XX is much more forgiving than games of the genre, such as \"The Binding of Isaac\" or \"Enter the Gungeon\". Although those play much differently.\n\n[u][b]Story and Content:[/b][/u]\n\nNear non-existent. While the lore is extensive, the story isn't really there. It's as much of a story as the original Megaman X. However, from the cutscenes and encounters you face. You'll be able to piece together some semblance of a story. The story is just the right amount for a roguelike/roguelite game. Perhaps in the future there willl be more to read up on.\n\nThere's is however, a ton to look into. The lore for every enemy is written pretty well and gives good insight into them. Especially the bosses. There are currently 10 stages with varying difficulties, depending on how they fall into the run. The last two stages are always the same in terms of bosses, but the layout is still procedurally generated like the others. There are plans for more content in the future, however, what we have now is already a good amount for the price point.\n\n[u][b]Graphics:[/b][/u]\n\nWhile subjective, I really like the graphics style of 20XX. Very aesthetically pleasing, with a lot of small details you can notice (It's impressive if you do, considering how hectic the game can get). There are options to adjust the quality of the graphics in game, but it runs very well on almost all systems.\n\nThere are issues with stutter during instances with large amount of onscreen effects, such as explosions. But those instances are usually not going to cause you to make a mistake, as they are mostly cinematic. These small issues happen a bit more often than they should, but are actively being worked on. So be warned if you're on a lower end PC.\n\n[u][b]Soundtrack:[/b][/u]\n\nI love the soundtrack. It's amazing and fully captures what an action platformer like 20XX is. Cityfires, the composer of the soundtrack, has done a wonderful job. Each stage features a different soundtrack and does a great job of mixing the action and the atmosphere together to make you feel even more badass than you already are. \n\n[u][b]Community:[/b][/u]\n\nThe community of a game can make or break it. Here, the community is great in my limited experience with them. I regularly read the steam discussion boards in order to get information on the game and most people are extremely helpful. They even have a discord for multiplayer and game discussion.\n\nThe developer is also very active within the community and responds to critique and suggestions very well. It's great to see a developer actually take part in discussions and actively participate with everyone.\n\n[u][b]Replayability:[/b][/u]\n\nIt's a Megaman-esque procedurally generated action platformer. Yes, it's replayable. I've played it for the last 2 years. Wile not as expansive as something like \"The Binding of Isaac: Afterbirth+\". It's a lot less punishing and provides the same level of satisfaction. Every run is different and you need to learn and adapt to each situation differently. Every action you perform well makes you feel awesome, but that's probably because I have something of a hero complex.\n\nAdd on couch and online co-op. While the netcode is a bit iffy, it's still great to play online with another person and makes for a different experience from single-player. I originally played with my brother, who I grew up playing the X-series with when we were younger. The multiplayer really adds on another layer of gameplay for you and your friends to enjoy.\n\n[u][b]Final Thoughts[/b][/u]\n\n20XX is a great game with tons of replayability and content.

The game itself has seen steady improvements and is definitely in a spot worthy or release, especially considering some of the other titles I've seen leave early access much too early. \n\nGameplay has a very nostaligic megaman feel, with some of its own original flare. I hate comparing it to megaman as it truly feels like its own game, but the comparisons are there. What differentiates this game is the rogue like element and how upgrades are handled, using a number of different methods to obtain upgrades (shops, chest in levels, glory zones, post level chests). There is a ton of replayability here between different game modes, not mention there are two playable charaters, as well as multiplayer.\n\nWhile I haven't played much multiplayer to review it accurately, multiplayer improvements should receive love in future updates, and may end up being a larger focus now that the game is out of early access. As it stands now multiplayer seems serviceable, which is what I'd expect for release. \n\nWhen all is said an done, it really comes down to price for a lot of people. Is the price you're paying worth what you'll get out of the game? \n-If you are a megaman fan and enjoy this style of gameplay, this is a definite buy\n-If you're looking for a game you can hop in and out of with quick sessions, or enjoy rogue likes, this is worth a buy \n-If you're anyone else, buy this game when it's on sale, for any sale price, because this is worth the money", "timestamp_created": 1502908592, "timestamp_updated": 1502908592, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34281255": {"recommendationid": "34281255", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003485946", "num_games_owned": 497, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1748, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509082456}, "language": "english", "review": "Easy pick, if you like megaman, if you like rougelite elements, you like dis.", "timestamp_created": 1502907060, "timestamp_updated": 1502907060, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496183", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34280724": {"recommendationid": "34280724", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025397681", "num_games_owned": 52, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1448, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503291139}, "language": "english", "review": "I bought this game during early access nearly 3 years ago. It was worth the money then, and it has improved so much since then.\n\n20XX is an action-platformer in a similar style to the Mega Man X games for SNES. The twist is that the levels, powerups, bosses, etc are procedurally generated, providing greater replayability. There are also several features designed to improve replayability, such as online multiplayer, metagame progression (unlocks, etc), seeded challenges, multiple characters (basically, ranged or melee).\n\nThe procedural generation serves to keep things interesting, but it is not purely random. Difficult optional paths often hold stronger powerups. Stages get longer and bosses change their behavior based on the order in which you fight them. This means that on one run you may encounter the penguin boss first and defeat him easily, but on the next run he may be the 5th boss and prove quite challenging. Currency and shops also help give you control over the randomness. You can collect \"nuts\" and spend them on extra health, energy for weapons, or save up for new powerups/weapons.\n\nAfter playing for a while, you will start to notice the recurring rooms used in the proc-gen, but most of them have multiple ways to traverse them. In some worlds, the levels are pretty clearly a series of rooms stitched together in random order while other worlds do a better job of creating a level that feels like it was created by hand. However, all the stages still have hidden paths to uncover. The challenge becomes how to adapt your playstyle to the powerups/weapons/enemy patterns you are given in order to complete a run as efficiently as possible.\n\n[b]Noteworthy features:[/b]\n[list]\n    [*]Online co-op play\n    [*]Seeded challenges\n    [*]Metagame progression (powerup unlocks)\n    [*]Lots of melee/ranged weapons supporting a variety of playstyles\n    [*]Great, energetic soundtrack\n[/list]", "timestamp_created": 1502905234, "timestamp_updated": 1502905234, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34279732": {"recommendationid": "34279732", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000667659", "num_games_owned": 63, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1935, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503448325}, "language": "english", "review": "This game rocks.", "timestamp_created": 1502901817, "timestamp_updated": 1502901817, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496183", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34279642": {"recommendationid": "34279642", "author": {"steamid": "76561198144469469", "num_games_owned": 63, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1535, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 73, "last_played": 1514259700}, "language": "english", "review": "I cannot begin to describe my utter love of this game, the music the controls the visuals, all of it is so good that if capcom came out and said they maid this I still wouldn't believe that they could make such as masterpiece!

Robot Masters? Mavericks? They never say what affiliation the bosses belong to, just that they're tearing the city apart, and you need to stop them.\n\nGraphics~: Inspired by the days of classic gaming, 20XX harbors a rich 16-bit color palette, with plenty of lens flares and glowing, ambiant attacks by all characters, protagonist and antagonists alike.\n\nMusic~: The music is very catchy, although due to bosses sharing stage themes (equating to four main themes between the eight of them), you will have to listen to a couple themes a few times... more so when you inevitably die and do a new run. A good thing they're catchy and enjoyable to listen to, then!\n\nGameplay~: The bread and butter of the package. 20XX, being a spiritual successor to Mega Man X, has you running, jumping, and shooting/slashing at everything come your way, as to be aspected. However, with the roguelike elements in play, the layout of each stage changes between every run, ensuring that one simply cannot memorize a stage and its hazards, forcing players to build upon their reaction times and learn the ins and outs of their enemies and the weapons available to them. Nuts are the main currency within the game to allow you to purchase various augments (AUGS) or armor pieces to enhance your character and your odds of surviving the run. Every stage ends with a boss fight, and beating him rewards you with a large chest, which you can shatter to get some pick-up goodies.\n     Once a boss is slain, you then get the choice of taking their weapon, taking a large stack of nuts, or a random AUG. You may only hold onto three boss weapons at a time, but each is assigned their own button, and boss weapons can be replaced with new ones. Unlike traditional Mega man titles, your first stage is randomly selected at the start of the run, and completing each stage grants you the choice between three of the remaining seven boss stages, randomly determined before you get to the end. Holding true to Mega Man tradition, the bosses do have a weapon weakness order, although whether you are lucky enough to have the run allow you to make use of the weakness order is entirely up to luck. Due to the roguelike nature of the game, later stages get progressively more difficult the further you get, forcing you to improve your reaction times, and expects you to have some pieces of armor.\nArmor upgrades come in four types: Helmet, Body, Arms, and Legs. In addition, there are four different complete sets; while you are free to mix and match what pieces you come across in your run, each armor set has a unique set bonus for completing the armor. The last thing worth mentioning in the core gameplay are the other two types of currency: Tokens, and Soul Chips. Tokens are used on the slot machine device that shows up randomly in the stages, usually in the hallway leading to the boss. Soul chips are acquired at the end of a stage and from random, uniquely glowing enemies. Unlike Nuts, Soul Chips cannot be spent during a run, and instead are saved for when the run is over (whether it was a success or not...), and are used in the main lobby to purchase new AUG's for future runs, new permanent passive AUS's that don't need to be collected, being able to start with a few AUGs, and buying Tokens to use in the run.\n\nThere are a lot of things I have ommitted explinations on, such as the various difficulty modes, daily and weekly challenge runs, seeded runs, and multiplayer. However, the core material mentioned in Gameplay applies to all of it, and that's what really counts here. Without naming.... another, disappointing title, 20XX honors and maintains the spirit of the legendary blue bomber, and will keep you coming back for more and more... and more... and more... and more...

I am absolutely terrible at Mega Man and games similar to it. But you don't need to be good at something to have fun with it, and that's been most of my experience with 20XX. Fans of Mega Man X will notice more similarities with that series than with the classic Mega Man, but you don't need to have Mega Man experience at all to enjoy what 20XX offers: a well-crafted, difficult, roguelike platformer experience.\n\nYou get two characters to choose between: Nina, who fires long-range blaster shots, and Ace, who has a close-range sword for melee combat. There are 10 levels to complete, but good luck making it that far, you'll find yourself having some hard times by level 3 or 4. Being a roguelike, this game allows you to improve every time you die through purchasing permanent upgrades or augments that you can acquire mid-run. Levels are generated randomly every time you enter them, and boss patterns will change depending on when you face them (Level 1 Kur is much easier than Level 5 Kur, for example).\n\nThe absolute best thing about 20XX is its presentation. My God, Battery Staple Games, do you have the entire cast of the original Mega Man games working for you? This looks exactly like what would happen if you took the platformers of old and gave them modern paint. The levels, the characters, the bosses, [i]the music dear lord the music[/i], it's all an amazing treat.\n\nThe gameplay is entirely dependant on personal experience. Levels are randomly generated, after all, so one run through the Vaculab will be different from the next run through the Vaculab. For the most part, enemies and hazards are placed in spots that are easy to overcome, or will require a bit of quick thinking, but there will certainly be a couple of cheap shots against you. Historically speaking, the Agnisort level has been the poster child of difficulty, and for me it's still certainly an annoyance with some cheap fire hazards. That being said, I did open this review saying that I'm not good at this game, so your mileage will certainly vary. Keep in mind that the later levels in this game are not for the faint of heart; I've made it as far as level 6 or 7 before, and those were brutal. Levels 8, 9, and 10 apparently go even further, so be prepared for a challenge.\n\nMy last note is on performance. The game runs very smoothly, but for those of you on lower machines, you may want to turn down a few settings. Some levels and effects, particularly Agnisort, may slow your gameplay down.

It's certainly better than Mighty No. 9, and for cheaper too.

Moving platforms and tight jumps are the norm of the randomly seeded maps, and while health at first is more than enough to face off the many enemies you will encounter, one wrong move or poorly-timed jump too many will leave you at the mercy of the boss at every level's end.\n\nIt also does not help in your favor for the enemies to work together with the map, to bring you down and back to the hub level known as the \"Ark\". The game can always be played again, but so will the many colorful enemies, often in the likeness of common garden insects, and just as buggy and apathetic as you would expect from them. The good news is, many weapons and toys are at your disposal, and can ease in squishing your foes.\n\nA basic blaster or energy sword, depending on your character, is standard issue and can be charged for more kapow. They are more than versatile, but often at times they can really feel lacking. Some power-ups can be obtained after vanquishing a boss, or buying them in the Ark for metal nuts, the universe's currency. They do require an energy supply, however, and are not to be depended on for longer battles.\n\nEvery map is always a new adventure, and almost certainly will never be repeated again. All the enemies will be positioned and waiting for you in different places, every time. Some set-pieces can be recognized, but with a ticking clock promising goodies, and you being shot at from all directions, one can never be allowed to get too familar with their surroundings.\n\nAnd for those who may grow bored of even the randomly-seeded nature of the game, an easy solution is in play for those who are willing to use them. Various \"skulls\", each representing a new and deadly setback, challenges you to experience the game with the deck stacked against you in different ways. One may simply increase the damage enemies do, or perhaps it does something rather creative, such as making the clock eat away at your health if it hits zero.\n\nOverall, 20XX is a solid title, and one that proudly represents what Early Access can really do. I myself have not played very much of it, but I can easily see the hard work and integrity that has gone into it, and all I can do now is wonder at what it could be after it retires from Early Access, and beyond.

Its not that said games can't be good or even great, but invoking titles like \"Super Metroid\" or \"Super Mario 64\" makes it hard to separate very lofty expectations from the new game in question. Its easy to have a resemblance to something, but much more difficult to properly encapsulate everything that made a classic special.\n\nAnd so I open with that to say: well played, 20XX. You showed me.\n\nNo, this is not MegaMan X. This game has a lot of the same core as MegaMan X, but the roguelike aspect of this game really twists it into something all its own. So does the term \"MegaMan-inspired\" still hold weight then? It does, but it does in one very specific way. If anything, 20XX takes one thing from MegaMan X and smashes it out of the Strike Man stage: that progression of power throughout a run.\n\nI'm going to assume for the sake of this review that you don't need MegaMan explained in detail: its run-n-gun platforming where you fight bosses, steal their tech and slowly become a walking robotic armory. 20XX takes that latter idea and runs with it hard. While the \"secret\" areas housing powerups are far more telegraphed in this game due to its roguelike nature, the selection of available uprages is incredibly extensive. One run you might have ridiculous charge shots that go through shields and the next you might have several speed upgrades coupled with an air-dashing ability. Discovering synergies and bulldozing the opposition with them can be oh so satisfying.\n\nIndeed, the equipment diversity is fantastic. You have alternate default weapons, repros (read: pet drones,) and prototype augments that do... interesting things. Play safe, play tactically, play wild. You decide. Some boss weapons slide into well-known stereotypes, but I would say all of them feel useful and nuanced. You also aren't restricted to one weapon at a time and can bind boss weapons to secondary controls, which is HUGE (you can finally use your shield power and buster at the same time!) Remember armor upgrades from MegaMan X? We've got those too: four entire sets, as of me writing this review. Seriously, the accumulation of power throughout a run can culminate in some pretty amazing moments.\n\nCombat is king in this game, even if other echos of MegaMan feel a little lacking at times. For one, there are only four level themes right now (two bosses per each theme.) Despite this, the four zones are very distinct from one another. The bosses, though they employ some very unique gameplay mechanics, don't feel as iconic or memorable as those from the MegaMan series (Vile Visage is a notable exception, though!) The music falls into a similar category for me: its great music to play the game to but it doesn't strike me in the same way some of those old nostalgic tunes do.\n\nSome people may also be put off with the roguelike aspects... a major concern that kept me from purchasing the game for awhile. Permadeath is present; only one life (and no continues) per run unless you're playing on the \"casual\" difficulty. The \"one life\" aspect also means that insta-death has largely been done away with. Some people may breathe a sigh of relief that spikes no longer kill on contact, while others may be ready to raise their video game pitchforks. The game does feature some \"hardcore\" difficulty modifiers though, like the ability to restore spikes to their former glory...\n\nAs for me? I'm down with the concessions and changes made here. Because what 20XX gets right, it REALLY gets right. 20XX feels like an instance where it zeroed in on a specific aspect of an old classic, and made it soar. The tactical combat is absolutely fantastic, and everything else does a great job of holding that key point up. I not only respect 20XX for its tight focus, but sincerely enjoy it.", "timestamp_created": 1499738468, "timestamp_updated": 1502205042, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.600666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33390924": {"recommendationid": "33390924", "author": {"steamid": "76561198146305159", "num_games_owned": 66, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 911, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506887705}, "language": "english", "review": "Overly difficult unresponsive trash.

This game is hard, not because of bad mechanics or poor level design or stupidly-designed bosses.  No, it's hard because of the opposite - VERY good level design in its randomly generated segments, VERY good mechanics and smooth playstyle, and EXCELLENT bosses that feel unique to this game rather than a carbon copy of anything else.  On top of that everything has an answer, or a specific timing, or a way to fight it, and you have to make snap decisions on how to address every situation or else.  Fast paced and intense, just the way I like it. \n\nBoth playable characters are balanced, with strengths and weaknesses that create two very different playstyles beyond simply having the equivalent of X Buster or Z Saber.  Unlike the Megaman X series, our Zero equivalent ONLY gets melee. No ranged capability of any kind until he starts picking up powers, which makes every enemy a completely different beast to deal with - some much easier, some much harder.  The armor sets provide dramatic changes to gameplay - maybe you'll start thinking of how to dash into projectiles to use your shield, or navigate platforms that would have been an absolute pain before you picked up jetboots, or pick up a new blaster that lets you fire in multiple directions and revise where you stand in a fight. The possibilities are many and greatly varied.\n\nThe biggest setback would be the roguelike aspect, which is both its greatest strength and its greatest weakness.  On the one hand you get a unique game every time as with all roguelikes, since the powers you get and the random level generation define how you go through the levels.  On the other hand, you get really close to the end, you have so many powers and tools and upgrades and suddenly you get hit with a trap that takes the one powerup you don't have to make it manageable and BAM, half your health gone.  Or straight up destroyed by a swarm of bullets and/or enemies where you have no room to maneuver, and have to start completely from scratch.  \n\nThe end result is that there will be times where you ragequit for an hour, or a day, or a week, but inevitabely you'll come back because this game is irresistably good, easily the best Megaman equivalent out there. I intend to invest many hours into this game, and I will enjoy every minute of it even when I'm raging at the sudden burst of falling off levels from teleporters because the moving space underneath is in the wrong place.\n\nHave yet to try the coop, so I don't know how big an impact that makes on the game.", "timestamp_created": 1499474412, "timestamp_updated": 1499477440, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33327546": {"recommendationid": "33327546", "author": {"steamid": "76561198148599667", "num_games_owned": 416, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 1355, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500421281}, "language": "english", "review": "I am a big fan of the original Megaman games, and this adds enough fresh content to keep me playing\n\n20XX is a 2d action platformer where you control one of two different healers, one uses a blaster and the other uses a cool energy sword. Each of these work similar, but I can definitely see someone preferring one, and I personally found I perform better with the blaster. You then take these and run through a series of procedurally generated levels gaining powerups, and new pieces from your suit in order to conquer each boss. The powerups are gained a la megaman, where you defeat a boss and then gain a powerup similar to a move that boss uses. The powerups are all cool, well balanced, and polished to not feel weird using. The suit augments are also very nice, but are typically direct stat upgrades, with the exception of things like charging causing objects to attract to you. Both of these are really nice, and allow for different playstyles and I was never disappointed seeing them.\n\nPlaying on a Curve\n\nThe stage level design is always pretty good. Even though it is partially procedural, each level centers its platforming around a central platform, or gimmick. The stage types are different from one another, but not all of these stages are created equal. You will start in a random stage, provided you don\u2019t enter a seed, and some of these stages will be much more difficult than the others. I always preferred the jungle stages to the lava ones, and felt it was a bit unfair when you would be plopped in the middle of a difficult stage, with no powerups, or augmentations to help you through. After you complete a stage you get a choice of three, and after a couple playthroughs, you will get a feel for what you are equipped for.\n\nHi-Res\n\nAfter a constant slew of mediocre / pixel graphics in indie games (not to knock pixel graphics), but it is nice to see something that is sort of a break from the Norm. The cartoonish graphics are very nice, and don\u2019t look much like other cartoon graphics. I like the majority of the animations, but the idle animation looks a bit cheap, and not as nice as the others. The variety of color looks nice, with each of the level styles having their own color palette, and colors not repeating between the stages. \n\nLet\u2019s Make Some Noise\n\nThe Sound design in 20XX is pretty ok, with retro sounds and electronic music, but I don\u2019t think it matches the tone of the game perfectly. The game\u2019s music seems a bit out of place with the sorts of electro tracks you hear a lot in games, and that is not to say it is bad, just a bit mediocre. The sound effects follow suit, seeming to rely too much on retro sounds, and sound a bit dissonant from the game you are playing.\n\nOverall\n\n20XX is an entertaining game, and with the customization, is full of replayability. The art and music is pleasing, with only a few quirks. And the game is easy to control, and fun to play. With that in mind, 20XX gets an 8 out of 10 with a label of \u201cquality\u201d.\n", "timestamp_created": 1499383683, "timestamp_updated": 1499383683, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33280692": {"recommendationid": "33280692", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999043186", "num_games_owned": 876, "num_reviews": 58, "playtime_forever": 282, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511808636}, "language": "english", "review": "I like to call this one\nMighty No. FINE\n\nNo, seriously, check it out, it's great.\nMega Man X, the good one, with random levels that get gradually harder, and one life perma death.\nI didn't know I wanted this, either, but turns out I really do.", "timestamp_created": 1499270133, "timestamp_updated": 1499270133, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.585253", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33257788": {"recommendationid": "33257788", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005082271", "num_games_owned": 365, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 2256, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503697257}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Te gusta Megaman y Megaman X. 20XX es lo que necesitas.

I would be slighly disppointed.\n\nFor starters this game just starts no story no nothing to drive you through the game.\n\nThe gameplay isn't like megaman it looks like it is but it isn't, everything from your dash to your blaster feels hollow and feels as it has no impact. Unlike megaman from the levels to the bosses you swear this game is on easy mode there are no spikes that will kill you in one hit, this game is on a constant mission to push you through its level it doesn't want to frustrate you the player with any sort of challenge. When entering a boss door before you fall from the air to the ground the boss is already introduced and moving there is no timing its like this game has ADHD and the bosses designs and abilities are so uninspired if you happen to get by anything these bosses throw out at you may have unplugged your controller as that would be the only reasonable excuse.\n\nThe best description of this game is a hack n' slash shooter, it takes no braincells to play you may find fun in multiplayer but this game is basically like a speedrun in which you're speedrunning just to get the game over with.\n\n(((((EDIT)))))  _____________________________________________________________\n\nThis game may of not been for me but I went in with certain expectations that probably hurt my ability to enjoy the game to its full extent, if it was to be said I didn't give this game a fair chance and my biases killed my enjoyment then you would be right. This game isn't Megaman its something else and different isn't necasarily bad but its not the game I was looking for so I encourage you to still give it a chance.\n\nThe Development team among many I have spoken to took the time to listen too my complaints even though I come from a place of 0.4 hours of incite, they still listened and if you like this game or think it has potential I would trust them and the direction they choose to take with your best interests and intentions in mind.", "timestamp_created": 1498702595, "timestamp_updated": 1500614248, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.400902", "comment_count": "18", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "32961750": {"recommendationid": "32961750", "author": {"steamid": "76561197976937185", "num_games_owned": 198, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1280, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511836810}, "language": "english", "review": "Very underrated game.

I have to say, 20XX is a hella fun game to play regardless if you're playing coop or singleplayer.\n\nGameplay: 10/10\n\nThe augmentations feel balanced and fun to obtain, the weapons, powers, and armor combos make the game highly replayable, with every run feeling different from the last. The armor set bonuses make you feel powerful, and the powers have hidden attributes with them, like being able to disable traps! The controls are also really tight and feel very responsive, I can't think of anything wrong with it.\n\nMusic: 6/10\n\nThe music isn't anything special, but it does provide an energetic atmosphere to the levels. However, the music doesn't really seem to match the levels to be honest. That's not to say it isn't bad!\n\nSound: 7/10\n\nThe sound is good for the most part, but it can get repetitive and stale after some time. Most enemies don't make sounds, and any sounds from your powers or followers are quiet and don't quite give the feeling of being powerful, even if it is a fully charged quint laser. Still though, not bad.\n\nGraphics: 9/10\n\nI love the art style of this game!  Real cartoony, plus every enemy has a nice and distinct look! The particle and explosion effects are great, and every update will increase polish animations and graphics!\n\nAll in all, this game is an amazing indie game, and I feel that it captures the feeling of playing Megaman X, while still having it's own personal twist to it, being roguelike and all.

However, about 6 months ago, it was on sale and I decided to take the plunge. I'd been disappointed by Mighty No 9 and was looking for a good Mega Man esque game to fill the void that the lack of mega man had left. \nThis game is what I'd been looking for. Sure, there's a ton of bugs, but each time they patch the game (which happens every few weeks) it gets better and they are constantly adding new content. This game is quick and the levels ever changing, meaning you can never really tell exactly what you're going to get. \nThis is both the strength and weakness of 20XX. It's a strength since it's always testing you and pushing you with 'new' levels that have been generated. But it's a weakness because of the fact that unlike say a Mega Man title with a singular stage build you can't learn where challenges are and figure out how best to overcome them through trial and error. \nThis game has very little forgiveness which can be a serious turnoff for a lot of players. \nBut for someone who doesn't mind levels that keep you on your toes and having to use instinct to figure out WHICH powers you'll need and which ones you don't... \nThis is a game that will likely be right up your alley.", "timestamp_created": 1497548613, "timestamp_updated": 1497548613, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521327", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "32421735": {"recommendationid": "32421735", "author": {"steamid": "76561198281442952", "num_games_owned": 14, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1529, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505300208}, "language": "german", "review": "[h1]Rezension vom 15.06.2017[/h1]\n\nDu suchst einen Mega-Man-X-Klon? \n\nHier wirst du f\u00fcndig! Die beiden Hauptcharaktere sind \u00e4u\u00dferlich und waffenm\u00e4\u00dfig an Mega Man (Nina mit Plasmakanone) und Zero (Ace mit Laserschwert) angelehnt. Die Steuerung ist pr\u00e4zise und erm\u00f6glicht ein effizientes schnelles Spiel, wenn man es denn will. Es ist ein Rogue-Like-Game, also f\u00e4ngst du im Todesfall wieder von vorn an. Mit zuvor gesammelten Soulchips kannst du dir jedoch f\u00fcr den n\u00e4chsten Run Upgrades (z.B. zus\u00e4tzliche Feuerkraft, Lebensenergie, eine \"Drohne\" usw.) besorgen. In den Levels lassen sich Schrauben finden, bzw. durch die Zerst\u00f6rung von Gegner beschaffen, diese kannst du gegen Updgrades und zum Auff\u00fcllen deiner Lebens-, bzw. Waffenenergie eintauschen. \nAu\u00dferdem stirbst du nicht sofort, wenn du wie bei Mega Man auf Stacheln oder in eine Grube f\u00e4llst, sondern verlierst lediglich einen Energiestrich und tauchst dann sofort dort auf, wo du vor deinem freien Fall gestanden hast. Du kannst nach jedem besiegten Boss speichern und an dem Punkt sp\u00e4ter weiter spielen, jedoch wie gesagt: Stirbst du, so f\u00e4ngst du nicht beim Speicherpunkt, sondern von vorn an.\n\nEs gibt 8 Level und dazugeh\u00f6rige Endbosse. Die Levels ver\u00e4ndern sich bei jedem Run und je nachdem in welcher Reihenfolge man ein Level betritt, steigt der Schwierigkeitsgrad zus\u00e4tzlich an. So kann es noch mehr+schneller an/aus gehende Laserbarrieren, mehr+st\u00e4rkere Gegner geben, die beweglichen Plattformen sind noch schneller und \u00e4hnliches. Auch bei den Endbossen \u00e4ndert sich einiges. \n\nBeispiel: Hat man Death Lotus als Endgegner im ersten Level, so erscheint er beispielsweise zuf\u00e4llig aus einer von mehreren \u00d6ffnungen in der Wand, schie\u00dft bisschen, f\u00e4hrt seine langen dornigen Ranken aus, verschwindet und dann von vorn. Ist er in einem Run jedoch erst in ca. Level 6 dein Endgegner, so sieht das anders aus. Aus den \u00d6ffnungegn in der Wand k\u00f6nnen nun auch seine Spr\u00f6sslinge rauskommen, vernichtest du sie nicht, so werden es immer mehr. Diese k\u00f6nnen ebenfalls schie\u00dfen und du siehst dich bald einem gro\u00dfen Kugelhagel ausgesetzt, dar\u00fcber hinaus besteht dann auch noch der Boden des Bossraums zu gro\u00dfem Teil aus einer Fl\u00fcssigkeit, die dich besch\u00e4digen kann. Meiner Meinung nach haben die Bosse dann auch mehr Lebenspuntke.\n\nIch habe das Spiel am Anfang nur ab und zu nach Feierabend gespielt und doch gemerkt, wie ich langsam besser wurde. Zuletzt investierte ich mehr Zeit, sodass ich erst 6, 7 dann alle 8 Levels/Endgegener auf Schwierigkeitsgrad \"Normal\" besiegen konnte.\nDie Rekordzeiten f\u00fcr Runs kann man sich im Spiel ansehen, zus\u00e4tzlich gibt es auch noch Daily/Weekly Challenges, die man absolvieren kann, oder einen Modus bei dem du auf einen Endboss nach dem anderen treffen kannst. Dieser l\u00e4sst sich gut als Training nutzen.\n\nZu guter Letzt existiert sogar ein Mehrspielermodus, sehr interessant und lustig, einfach mal ausprobieren. Man spielt gleichzeitig, je weiter ihr euch von einander entfernt, desto kleiner werden die Figuren und die Spielumgebung f\u00fcr eure Augen, damit man auch alles \u00fcberblicken kann.\n\nEs ist ein Early-Access-Titel, aber der Preis von 14,99 \u20ac ist fair und das Spiel wirkt vollendet. Ich spekuliere darauf, dass es in Zukunft nach den ersten 8 Endgegnern/Levels, ein gro\u00dfes Endlevel geben k\u00f6nnte, ganz nach dem Vorbild der Mega-Man-Reihe ;) \n\nDie Updates kommen regelm\u00e4\u00dfig und Fans von Mega Man werden sowieso auf ihre Kosten kommen :)", "timestamp_created": 1497490846, "timestamp_updated": 1497491064, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "32382709": {"recommendationid": "32382709", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009489772", "num_games_owned": 107, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 762, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511999728}, "language": "english", "review": "as a super freinds member i say this one thing and one thing only, the game should be 9.99 until the full game comes out then bump it up, but hey what do i know, oh and amazing game 9/10 ( the rating i give to perfect early acces games when the full verion is out its a 10/10 most likely)", "timestamp_created": 1497339014, "timestamp_updated": 1497339014, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499376", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "32247887": {"recommendationid": "32247887", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040027211", "num_games_owned": 262, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 12, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483002270}, "language": "english", "review": "Just wasnt what I had hoped for.", "timestamp_created": 1496877245, "timestamp_updated": 1496877245, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.194321", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "32241014": {"recommendationid": "32241014", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995542916", "num_games_owned": 204, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2389, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 19, "last_played": 1514308110}, "language": "finnish", "review": "Great!", "timestamp_created": 1496849814, "timestamp_updated": 1496849814, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "32213315": {"recommendationid": "32213315", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067969051", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 957, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497066270}, "language": "english", "review": "Bad ass mega manrougelite", "timestamp_created": 1496723111, "timestamp_updated": 1496723111, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499730", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "32211185": {"recommendationid": "32211185", "author": {"steamid": "76561198095320362", "num_games_owned": 48, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1937, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507593777}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun, challenging, and lighting quick to get into.

Well, that's about where it stops. That's all the Mega Man you're getting, aside from a similar control scheme. Be grateful; it means there's room for so much goodness that wouldn't fit the Mega Mold, you won't know where to start.\n\n[h1]Like what?[/h1]\n\nWell, you'd almost never play a Mega Man game and completely eschew using the boss powers. You'd be denying yourself a vital part of the intended arsenal of the game. But in 20XX, you can (based on choice or by random luck) get pickups that make your main attack devastatingly powerful - at which point, you may decide to forego the powers the bosses give you, and instead take one of the two generic powerup augs that they offer instead, if they suit you. There are even special experimental augs that take this a step further and completely disable one form of attack, pushing the other form's damage even higher.\n\nThough, by ditching boss powers, you're also denying yourself something else Capcom's blue hero doesn't get, at least not often - each power has a useful secondary function. One knocks over vending machines, giving you their contents for free. Several of them disable certain types of environmental hazards, to make traversal easier. One of them can be freely pointed downwards, and will provide upwards lift when done so, allowing for some spectacular saves on the literal fly.\n\nThe several different sets of attainable armor mods are each their own very complimentary entities, and collecting a matched set always has it's benefits - unless you pick up the augment that gives you massive boosts for being mix-matched, in which case you want whatever you can get.\n\n[h1]Roguelike how?[/h1]\n\nThe game almost always presents you, through the drops you get, with a different way to attempt to play. Got a lot of life, jump height and run speed? Try dashing your way through at high speed. Lots of main weapon power and the Scatter upgrade? Shotgun robot time. Lots of weapon power and more weapon energy than you'll ever use? Go nuts with the very satisfying boss weapons. Picked up an experimental aug? Prepare for [i]anything[/i] to change.\n\nAs well, the levels change their layouts every time; you'll grow familiar with certain setpieces, but the ordering and even presence of those setpieces is shuffled every game, along with the presence of loot crates, stores, and other bonuses.\n\nAnd of course, death is final. There is no reloading a save after death, and you can only save when you quit. A nice touch is the fact that you will find fallen versions of the two playable characters lying on stages sometimes; the game will record when you die in a certain area/setpiece, and place a body there to be found and looted.\n\n[h1]How does it play?[/h1]\n\nLike a dream. The controls are tight and responsive, allowing for some really technical tricks if you feel like learning them. The sensation of speed and control when playing this game is perfect, and in some ways even [i]better[/i] than the source material.\n\nThe game is easy to understand, and every power-up (and there are a lot) explains what it does. The experimental augments are an exception, as they give cryptic hints rather than clear explanations, but a little thought can clue you in and of course, you'll know what it does if you pick it up.\n\nThere's a lack of a decent tutorial stage; the game kind of throws you right into an interactive menu, and you have to work it out from there. Anyone that's familiar with a MMX game will have no trouble, but a novice might get frustrated a bit before picking it up. (There, I suppose, is the roguelike facet again.)\n\n[h1]To wit: (tl;dr)[/h1]\n20XX is like Mega Man X with a randomizer attached, and can be experienced in more ways than you're probably expecting.

So you have to fight them all over again just to progress? Maybe it's my inexperience with this game but so far \"buying\" upgrades has been impossible. The unlocks have been few and far between considering I haven't been beyond two stages in. Don't get me wrong, I get it. This could all boil down to my abilities but making a game frustrating and mega-difficult isn't FUN.

Stages and their backgrounds are noise-free. Enemies stand out making easy targets for my blaster! Animations are fairly fluid, with main characters having a suiting slight robotic rigidity to their movements.\n\nContent - Plentiful\n-------------------\n\n3 difficulty modes, including one which allows you to customize the difficulty, granting bonus rewards based on your choices. Daily and weekly challenges exist along with hardcore modes for those truly looking for a challenge.\n\n4 sets of armor, a few different weapon types, and many passive items to discover.\n\n2 playable characters with different play styles: ranged and melee.\n\nPlenty of bosses to fight and steal powers from!\n\nControls - Super-tight\n----------------------\n\nCombat and controls are tight, responsive, and work very well with a gamepad (highly recommended). Not once did I feel the controls were the cause of my mistakes or deaths in game.\n\nSound - Nostalgic\n-----------------\n\nCombat sound effects, enemies blowing up, blasters charging, it all kept me in a state of nostalgia. The soundtrack is a retro-delight and is reminiscent of music found in games from the old Mega Man days.\n\nGameplay - FUNstrating\n----------------------\n\n20XX balances action and platforming well, rarely giving any lull in either for too long. There's always a secret chest to find at the end of challenging parkour platforming.\n\nEach set of armor has their own slot (head, torso, arms, feet) with stats altering your character in some way: dash in the air, chance to gain health when killing enemies, etc. Weapon modifications changed the way your main weapon behave: 3 way split, shotgun style, and so on. Passive items are available to find during the game to boost your character's overall stats.\n\nBosses each have various and more difficult versions of themselves depending on when you face them in the game. Defeating a boss provides you the option of taking their power, which may grant you an advantage against a future boss. Each boss has a weakness to one other boss' power and it's up to you to figure the correct combo.\n\nOnline co-op in a game like this is a treat and for the most part worked fairly well. I experienced one bug that caused me not to see my partner's attacks, not a deal breaker, but visually jarring when enemies are dying around your co-op friend, yet all you see is them jumping around. Network lag was not prevalent, however I did see some syncing issues when spectating my teammate, again nothing game breaking. On the plus side, each player receives their own loot, while the in-game currency, known as \"nuts\", are shared. Yes, you share your nuts with your teammate. \n\nOverall\n-------\n\n20XX is a great Mega Man style platformer fused with modern roguelike features. There are plenty of hours of fun here, especially if you want to find and unlock every item! Now grab a friend and charge up your blasters, it's time to pew pew.\n\n[url=http://discoverplayshare.com/review/20xx]Read the Full Review[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1494343610, "timestamp_updated": 1494343610, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}, "31641882": {"recommendationid": "31641882", "author": {"steamid": "76561198137361682", "num_games_owned": 181, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 322, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494419861}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u64cd\u4f5c\u611f\u8fd8\u884c\uff0c\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u5e73\u53f0\u5730\u5f62\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u96be\u5ea6\u8fd9\u70b9\u7740\u5b9e\u6076\u5fc3\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1494317788, "timestamp_updated": 1494317788, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496920", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "31639373": {"recommendationid": "31639373", "author": {"steamid": "76561198134207810", "num_games_owned": 107, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 5483, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 49, "last_played": 1513558383}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is so excellent. If you like either Mega Man X or roguelites I would easily recommend it, but if you happen to like both of them then it's a no-brainer, it will probably become your favorite game.\n\nLearning all the ins and outs of the different level pieces and enemy patterns is super satisfying. As you die run after run and make progress little by little you feel like you're really pushing forward and getting better at the game. And all along the way you unlock more upgrades and learn where more secrets are, until you eventually go into every run feeling like you can take anything the game can throw at you (particularly if you use the new permanent upgrades system).\n\nThe best thing about 20XX is that you can customize the experience to your liking. By default the game takes it easy on you in some of the areas where a proper Mega Man title wouldn't, such as falling into spikes or off ledges just dealing you damage instead of killing you outright, which is pretty necessary considering the permadeath aspect that isn't present in Mega Man. But if you don't want the game to go easy on you there? You can activate the corresponding \"skull\" in hardcore mode and you got it! There's a slew of these and they all can make the game more interesting and difficult.\n\nBut what if you're bad at video games like me and you need the game to coddle you a bit more than that? There's Reverent mode, in which you get three lives and start with three upgrades, and normal mode. Both of these modes have a permanent upgrades system where you can purchase stuff that you'll start every run with.

Con la possibilit\u00e0 di gicare in coop. WoW. Il gioco si pone come un platform non troppo complesso ma neanche troppo semplice. Con bei deseign di livelli e segreti con power up nascosti. Grafica leggera semplice ma gradevole con una buona colonna sonora 8bit. E gi\u00e0 il gioco cos\u00ec sarebbe un buon titolo se piace il genere. Ora combinate il tutto con the binding of isaac e ottenete un platform impegnativo ma dungeoncrowler. Una volta scelta la modalit\u00e0: normale, con delle semplificazioni da GDR , o difficile con delle complicazioni nel gameplay, Dovremmo arrivare alla fine del livello, raccogliere i potenziamenti, sconfiggere il boss di fine livello scegliere la nostra ricompensa e continuare fino a che resistiamo. C'\u00e8 da dire  che la difficolt\u00e0 \u00e8 tarata in modo da aumentare ogni coppia di livelli e forse il salto \u00e8 un po' troppo distante , quindi potrebbe risultare frustrante. Ma una volta compreso il moveset in stile bullet hell dei boss non sar\u00e0 difficile sconfiggerli. Una cosa che non ho ben capito  \u00e8 : di tanto in tanto troveremo dei \"soldi\" o cip di potenziamento che serviranno per comprare oggetti che ci daranno delle migliorie passive. Ma potremmo spenderli solo dopo la nostra morte. Dove torneremo nell Hub centrale. una volta fatto l'acquisto potremmo ricominciare da capo una nuova Run. Con quelle caratteristiche. Ma se moriremo alla partita successiva ripartiremo con nessun power up. Boh! Va beh. Comunque il gioco \u00e8 un ottimo prodotto cos\u00ec com\u00e8 ora che \u00e8 una pre alpha. Non so davvero come potrennero migliorarlo. Io gli do un 8/5 9 di voto. NOn gli do il massimo perch\u00e8 il concept il gameplay e il deseign dei mostri personaggi e livelli non \u00e8 innovativo per niente. Ma ripropone bene lo spiritio di un classico.

This is more or less just minor nitpicking\n\nCons\n-Blue and Red Protaganists, I can understand the X and Z love and tribute here but it would be nice to see a more original design\n-Stages are randomized and I know it's hard to make a true randomized stage and for this reason I dont mind replaying sections over but more diverse terrain/environmental hazards would fix this quite nicely\n-For as many times as I have stacked \"More bolt/More Hp\" drops it doesn't seem to do a whole lot\n\nThats about it for those as the game feels quite solid.\n\nOnly thing I would love to see this game do though is have a story mode as who doesn't love lore\n\nOne more thing!

I'll explain:\n\nFirst off, here we have a female protagonist so girls are no longer a sidekick or simple npc. Secondly the rogue-like elements because rogue-like is very popular now days so why not?\n\nThe proceedurally generated levels add a level of difficulty. Let's face it, as Megaman fans we are used to memorizing the level layouts and enemy parterns but that's not really possible here. You have alot of options to play in different modes. Playing in casual mode makes the game much easier but offers very little reward. You have alot of powerups to buy but they're gone if you die.

At the end of the level after killing the boss, you get to pick 1 of 3 portals to determine what your next level will be. These portals show a picture of what boss it will be. \nThere is like 10 bosses, they are always the same fight, only they might be harder with a few new moves if you fight them later vs early. Even so, some bosses like the twins are about impossible if you fight them early- before you have been able to find a lot of upgrades, so pick what your next level will be carefully.\n\nAfter you defeat all the bosses without both players dieing *in the same level*, it's pretty much over, and it's easy to achieve this, and fast too. You can play with different challange modes on or off to make it harder- such as no health pickups- turbo mode- tougher baddies- more baddies- and such. You don't really get anything terribly interesting for doing these, some new unlockable upgrades to find in levels, otherwise completely optional.\nSpeaking of which there is lots of powerups to find and also purchase each play. Some are passive upgrades some are use items. From running faster, to double jumping and stronger guns, and so much more.\n\nThe 2 player netplay coop is fun and works good most of the time, though with a few bugs encountered that ended a run or 2. Nice to see a megaman coop game though.\nIf 1 player dies on a level, they can be brought back to life later, which does make coop easier then solo play, unless your partner isn't that good, or if you aren't that good heh.\n\n\nSounds good right?\nIt is good! Buuuut, within a few hours it was over, and I was left saying... that was it? It's good but, not much to it. If they don't massively expand it, I feel it should be much cheaper, but that's just my opinion.\n\nI like megaman games but not love them. So if you LOOOOVE megaman, you will likely enjoy 20xx more then I did. This project is a good idea and I hope the devs massively expand it.

I am TERRIBLE at MMX (and 20xx because of it). I love the original MMX Series so muc, and played it so hard, so often that I have every level memorized across the orginal 6 games, enemy spawn locations, boss movements. Truely nothing touches me in any of the originals. That however doesnt mean I'm any good at them, Im just good at memorizing patterns, and teligraphs. \n\n20xx on it's own merrit, is utterly fantastic. Every playthrough doesnt just remind me of the original MMX games that I loved in my youth, it reminds me that at one point I was fucking horrible at them. 20xx Just became the replacement for my SNES Emulator. \n\nThis game isnt just fan-service though. 20xx introduces procedurally generated levels, that are never impossible to pass. The bullet hell like sinerios are utterly satisfing to passthrough and they arent impossible by any means, there is almost always a way to get through it, (though sometimes you need to get REALLY inventive, and REALLY lucky). \n\nTaking a chance on EA Games is something I do, fairly often, as I remember being \"that indie developer\" that no one wanted to support, so I love a chance to helpout new and upcomming IP's. And I was NOT Disapointed when I firied up 20xx and was greeted with an arcade style main menu, and chiptunes remicent of the NES / SNES age (as well as Arcasde machines). \n\nThe Controls are as tight as you would expect from old style sprite games. I mean they are RAZOR Sharp, and it feels perfect. The sounds and music are imersive, yet actiony enough to keep pushing you. Sadly the music also makes you feel a bit more invincible than you really are :-). The game play is incredible. The bosses are hard, and at high levels, are damn near impossible. (Twin Astrals, Deathlutus). \n\nFor us old mega man fans there's enough legacy refrences to keep us nastalgic. But if you know nothing about the original MMX games, you can still play and enjoy 20xx for what it is.\n\nMy ONLY complaints really is that there is (currently) only 4 tilesets, and I feel like there should be 8. Not because of the MMX games, but because each boss should have their own unique level designs. And do not attempt to play this game without a controller. Im sure many are capable, but if you're an old SNES MMX fan, keyboarding is pretty difficult. To be fair though, I dont know that games of this genre should be played with a keyboard. \n\nControls: 10/10\nMusic/Sounds: 9/10\nGraphics: 9/10\nReplayability: 10/10\n----------------------\nTotal: 9.5/10 \n\nIf you're into Roguelike platformers, you would be a fool to pass this one up.\n\nAlso, if the soundtrack is released as a seperate purchase, count me in.", "timestamp_created": 1491368155, "timestamp_updated": 1491469976, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509614", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30953553": {"recommendationid": "30953553", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024964952", "num_games_owned": 419, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 5389, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505605019}, "language": "english", "review": "I've had this game for about ten months or so, and in that time the developer has only been late for the regularly-scheduled biweekly update one time.

There are some bugs in gameplay, but nothing to big (as of yet.)\n\nBut don't take my word for it, buy the game and give it a try yourself!

It's bittersweet because this game is great, frickin' fantastic even, and it proves to me that it has potential to become even greater. The bitter part is that it hurts me inside to know that I'll never see such a labor of love from Capcom themselves.\n\nOverall, try the game. If you enjoy it, keep playing!

It feels like you're playing Megaman X in terms of how tight the controls are and how precise you have to move your character to got without damage. As a fan of Rogue like games, this is up there for one of my faves. \n\nYou start the game normally (without any items) and as you play you get more powerful. However, one of the cool things is that as you play, there are tougher enemies that drop currency for when you start a new run. That currency is then used for buying new items that you get to try right away! Imo that was a really sweet move because in a lot of rogue like games, ala Boi or Enter the Gungeon, you don't get to even see how good the item you just unlocked is until you randomly get it in a run.\n\nI also really like how the implemented the weapons and equipment into the game. As I said before you start out with nothing (aside from your purchase before a run) and as you go you get items. However some items are part of your equipment that give you sweet powers like hovering, lifesteal, quick dashes, other stuff like that, but those items are part of a set of armor so if you want a chestplate, you have to get rid of the old one. Think of the active items in Binding of Isaac, except they're passive. \n\nWhich brings me to my next point. The boss items are really cool. They are your activated items that you use energy (NRG) to use. You can have as many as you want as they make it so that in your start screen you can rearrange them as you please. You have 3 main ones and the rest are just benched until you need them. My complaint would be that it's kind of a bummer that you have to decide between the active item or another item you may need more. The solution, imo, would be to instead of having a random passive drop from the boss, have the activated item drop instead, and putting the item you would normally find in the chest at the end of the room. In other words, switching the placement of where you get the active item and passive items.\n\nI just want to say, this game is dope.

I don't know if it's from liking Zero from Megaman X, or playing the Castlevania series... but I do seem to enjoy playing Ace a lot more than Nina.

It plays really well even on a toaster(check the specs), especially if you turn it onto Less High.\n\nThe gameplay is basically jump and shoot, like Mega Man, but it also adds a dash. On the ground, the dash can be cancelled by dashing again for jumping, which is like normal jumping but with increased air mobility, and is almost essential, especially in platforming segments. Luckily, this doesn't matter too much. The enemies all have a predictable pattern, and you must learn these unless you want to risk taking damage, which you need for the bosses. The flower things, for example, shoot a spike at you, and then they are stuck for a bit.\n\nThe bosses are really well done, and even though they don't do their attacks in a specific order(I think), You can still figure out the individual attacks and dodge those. After you kill them, you can choose between 3 items: The boss power, 10 nuts(money) or an Aug(more on that later). The boss power is a weapon they use, which in turn you can use, 10 nuts is literally just 10 nuts, and the Aug is a random Aug.\n\nAugmentations (or Augs) are power ups. Some only do good things; take Contractor Plus, for example. It raises every stat by one. Some are tradeoffs, like one that increases damage and health but costs speed. They are almost needed but you don't need to stress over getting them, you'll just die.\n\nIf you beat a level fast enough, you get a prize. This could range from an Aug, to nuts and health, to a new weapon, such as a shotgun. Everytime you win, you get a random number of soul chips, which can be used to unlock new weapons and Augs when you die.\n\nThere are also things strewn about the levels, like vending machines that give health for nuts, or the occasional \"Very Safe Laboratory,\" or even shops. The shops give you stuff for nuts, and have a health vending machine in them. Very Safe Laboratories give you a prototype aug. I won't spoil what they do, you can just find that out yourself.\n\nThere are things you can do at the Ark, the place you go when you open the game and the place you go when you die. You can unlock Augs, or buy already unlocked ones with Soul Chips. You can also buy Tokens for a slot machine, which appear in levels. There are other modes too, like Casual and Defiant. Casual lets you have 3 free Augs, while Defiant lets you make the game harder. Both aren't eligible for leaderboards.\n\nYou can play as Nina or Ace. Nina has a gun while Ace has a sword. They both have very different playstyles and Augs can have different effects with them. There is also multiplayer, which is basically 2 players playing at once.\n\nThe level generation is very well done, and I like how it all works toghether.\n\nThe music is great, and I love the graphics. But there are still some problems. For one, there are a few glitches, and a few explotable problems with the generation (i.e.: Skipping whole areas because of an insane jump stat, or double jump). But I expected that, since this game is in early access. I can't wait for the game to be finished, because it already feels complete, and since there are going to be more updates, I'll love to see what happens.

From start to finish. All it's titles and even the less great ones seem to have held a special place in my heart. Megaman X in general though was the one that I grew up playing the most of. I grew up always asking why it was never 2 player Co-Op and I can't be the only person who felt like it was such a missed opportunity on capcoms part for not having ever allowed it to be Co-Op. I have only owned this game for 2 days now, I have played the hell out of it and the nostalgia rating is 10/10. But set aside nostalgia and look at this game as a stand alone game that simply takes what megaman always was and builds up on it to make itself unique. It is still early access and already has an incredible amount of potential to be one of my favorite games of all time.\n\nThe inputs are flat out amazing, I did have to change the bindings so that B on my Xbox controller was my dash, I couldnt handle the default RB being the dash, but set aside that..I have changed nothing and love everything. I recently got to play it with my friend who I grew up together always saying \"Why isn't megaman 2 player co-op\" it was literally like getting ina time traveling device and warping back in time to play megaman as we thought it should be. (Not to diss megaman, I am such a huge fangirl of megman lol) This game exceeded my expectations for being a game that isn't even complete yet. For the price especially. It seems steep at first until you realize that this game has near infinite replayability (Especially if you read up on the forums as to what the devs plan to do with the game in the future, such as a creating your own stages and such that get shared with the community and put into the actual game.) I not only enjoy the game as it is right now at this very moment, but the updates I hear that are coming are exciting to hear. \n\nMost of these other reviews will go into way more depth than I will, for me I realize the selling point was the Co-Op gameplay. There is never any lag, I've had no issues thus far, no bugs that I have found, And trying to play the game in lightning mode is hilarious when you have a friend who mashes dash and can't control his character. Watching him slide off the edge to his death about half a million times while I wait at the top was priceless. I recommend this game for anyone like me who grew up playing megaman and wanted to play WITH your friends instead of taking turns on stages. \n\nThis is a beautifully done game and a far better one than that of \"Mighty Number 9\" which wasn't at all that mighty. This game instantly succeeded where that game fails. The soundtracks good, the gameplay is amazing, the challenge is incredible but starts off easy for the new players who would just enjoy casual gaming. The items seem fair and pretty balanced (for the most part at least, I always feel OP until suddenly I'm at 2 HP and wondering wtf happened to my life) \n\nOver all, I came here to put this review here with 2 days into the game because it has ALREADY exceeded my expectations and I know I will enjoy this game in the days following. I may even come back to add more to the review later when they add things for updates. This game is just too good. 10/10 already, and its unfinished.

Bosses also gain more difficult abilities/behaviors as you progress on each \"run\" you make.\n\n- Optional modifiers increase difficulty in multiple ways: Increased enemy speed, stricter time limits, restricted item drops, and longer levels to name a few.\n\n- 2 characters, each with different weapon behavior power-ups, and a different approach to combat\n\n- Shared-screen multiplayer done extremely well.

Played for like 1 hour with 0 freezing.\nNot the optimal solution for me but I guess it's safe to say the game's not the culprit at all.\n\nVery cool and unique gameplay (platformer-roguelike-mega man mix) with neat presentation.

with some elements you might've seen in Rogue Legacy or other similar titles. What more do you need?\n\nXXX\n\n- Procedurial generation might limit what the dev team can do with stages in terms of unique looking locations or secret placement somewhat, but the advantages in replayability may very well outweigh that.\n\n- I found the way this game does its difficulty curve interesting, even if it tends to kick my butt 100% of the time so far. It appears to expand enemy movesets and stage layout combinations not only for the duration of the current run but also as you gradually unlock items in the shop.\n\n- Music and sound effects didn't particularly left an impression on me, but they are informative and do not irritate.\n\n- I found the color palette pleasing to the eye despite all the explosions and energy blasts constantly happening on the screen. Some animations look like they could use a little bit more detail when compared to others, but overall it seemed quite smooth. I've liked the idea behind Ace's plasma cutter thingy and some other little details and have yet to come across anything that I actively disliked or that looks like it doesn't fit. Although some stages could perhaps benefit from some more doodads in thier 'building blocks'.\n\n- Despite struggling with the difficulty, I did not find the game frustrating. The way the characters move and control are the major reasons why. Big kudos to the dev team!\n\n- Humorous, tongue-in-cheek poking fun of what is happening on the screen starting from the intro and all the way to the run result comments add to the atmosphere in a nice way.\n\n- On the technical side of things, I've run into some visual artefacts only once so far. UI scaling doesn't appear to alter the size of text popups of characters talking, item descriptions in the pause menu or skull selection screen. Some walls are prone to stopping the characters' sliding down them unexpectedly repeatedly at the same spots.\n\nXXX\n\nOverall impressions:\n\nWell worth the asking price as of [2017/01/14], if you ask me.

Ended up being very, very satisfied with the game (at least, in its current state, since it's an Early Access title).  It really scratches that Mega Man X itch (despite the intro obviously referencing MM2, the game is overall trying to replicate the X series more than anything) and then some.  Controls feel really good (using a PS3 controller, with the actual in-game controls tuned to my liking), gameplay is fast and quite fun, music is very catchy and enjoyable to listen to, and the Defiant settings let you turn up the dial with some difficulty spices to season the game to your liking.  Even when I can recognize particular segments (it's not possible to have an unlimited number of set pieces for a stage, after all), the different combinations still feel fresh and engaging to tackle.  My one real complaint lies with the visuals and animations, which I personally feel are a disservice to the cool character designs and give the game a kinda Flash-like appearance that might turn some people away from an otherwise really great game.  The game also currently lacks a proper end-game (ending after the eight bosses, assuming the Endless Run defiant setting is turned off), though from what I can gather, it's something that's currently being worked on among other things.\n\nOverall, I think if you're longing for a solid Mega Man game (X series in particular) and the idea of a Mega Man-esque rogue-like game sounds like it might be your cup of tea, I'm confident that you'll end up very much enjoying this game, even in its technically unfinished state.", "timestamp_created": 1484255741, "timestamp_updated": 1484255793, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29190281": {"recommendationid": "29190281", "author": {"steamid": "76561198162367678", "num_games_owned": 92, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 375, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498673536}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "20XX tem fortes inspira\u00e7\u00f5es na franquia Mega Man, e \u00e9 com alegria que digo que os desenvolvedores superaram a qualidade do jogo que lhes inspirou, n\u00e3o me entenda mal, aprecio toda a franquia, mas 20XX tem um n\u00edvel de gameplay muito mais completo, seus cenarios gerados proceduralmente s\u00e3o desafiadores e quase sempre equilibrados, a maneira como os chefes aumentam sua dificuldade com o passar da \"Run\" tambem \u00e9 louvavel, e sim, esse \u00e9 um jogo de \"Runs\", com uma rejogabilidade enorme e muitos modos de jogo, a equipe esta fazendo um otimo trabalho.\n\nAproveite e d\u00ea uma passada em meu canal, teremos 20XX em breve ^^\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-YVP-ef2ym408X_Y2Qn4oQ", "timestamp_created": 1484165774, "timestamp_updated": 1484165774, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29186497": {"recommendationid": "29186497", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036490566", "num_games_owned": 265, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 4086, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510883834}, "language": "english", "review": "It brought much sadness in my life when Capcom threw the Megaman series out the door and I lost hope after the creator of the series made a failed attempt to make a spiritual sucessor A.K.A Mighty No. 9... then 20XX came along and brought me happiness.

Ja, Mega Man hat sozusagen eine Geschlechtsumwandlung hinter sich, hat den Eingriff jedoch gut \u00fcberstanden und ist so fit wie eh und je. Mega Man Zero ist von der Emanzipationsbewegung verschont geblieben, allerdings hat auch er einen neuen Namen, n\u00e4mlich Ace.\n\nAber Scherz beseite, was ist 20XX und das hat das Spiel mit Mega Man zu tun?\nVor langer, langer Zeit, als Gameboy und Super Nintendo noch den technischen Fortschritt in der Unterhaltungsbranche verk\u00f6rperten, gab es einen kleinen blauen Roboter, der durch, naja sagen wir \"nicht ganz einfache\" Level lief, sprang und schoss, um sich am Ende eines jeden Levels gegen einen fiesen Boss zur Wehr zu setzen. Das Sch\u00f6ne an den Spielen war nicht nur der hohe Schwierigkeitsgrad, der zum Training von Jump'n'Run-Titeln aufforderdete, sondern Mega Mans spezielle F\u00e4higkeit. Die bestand, wie in der Fernsehserie, darin, die Kr\u00e4fte besiegter Gegner zu erben und sich auf diese Weise einen Vorteil im Kampf gegen einen anderen Boss zu sichern (welcher das war, musste man im Zeitalter des sp\u00e4rlichen Internets noch selbst herausfinden, statt es zu googlen.).\nIch selbst habe vor allem Mega Man 4 f\u00fcr den Gameboy als Kind rauf und runter gespielt und zwar solange, bis ich die Kr\u00e4fte der Bosse nicht mehr brauchte, um das Spiel von Anfang bis Ende in einem Anlauf und recht kurzer Zeit durchzuspielen. Jahre sp\u00e4ter habe ich auf dem Nintendo DS Mega Man Zero (die Mega Man Zero Collection ist eine Neuauflage der 4 urspr\u00fcnglich f\u00fcr den Gameboy Advance erschienenen Teile) durch seine Level gequ\u00e4lt und kam trotz etwas anderer Mechaniken (der alte Mega Man konnte keinen Wandsprung und hatte einen Blaster, keinen S\u00e4bel) erneut zu dem Schluss: Wer glaubt ein italienischer Klempner sei die beste Jump'n'Run-Figur, der hat einfach keine Ahnung.\n\n20XX bietet im Wesentlichen genau die Inhalte, die die Mega Man (X/Zero) - Serie so erfolgreich gemacht haben:\nDie beiden Charaktere mit ihren unverwechselbaren Waffen, die M\u00f6glichkeit am Ende eines Levels die Bosswaffe zu erben und recht anspruchsvolle Level. Sicher ist 20XX nicht ganz so schwer wie die alten Mega Man - Teile oder bspw. Super Meat Boy, aber um ein gutes Spiel zu sein, muss es das auch nicht. Alle diejenigen, die jedoch als Kind Mega Man schon viel zu einfach fanden, kann ich beruhigen, neben dem Standard-Modus gibt es im Defiant-Modus zahlreiche M\u00f6glichkeiten das Spiel angenehm schwer zu gestalten.\nIm Moment (das Ende der Beta scheint sich zu n\u00e4hern) enth\u00e4lt das Spiel 8 Bosse in 4 unterschiedlichen Welten/Levelterrains; ein Endboss soll bis zur finalen Version folgen. Anders als Mega Man sind die Level prozedural generiert. Hier und da wiederholt sich zwar durchaus ein Teilabschnitt, allerdings gibt es schon jetzt viel Abwechslung (laut Entwickler sollen nach Release weitere Levelsbschnitte folgen); nicht zuletzt auch deshalb, weil die Level mit jedem besiegten Boss schwerer werden und sich die bekannten Teilabschnitte in deutlich anspruchsvolleren Versionen im Verlauf des Spieles wiederfinden.\n\n\u00dcber eine Sache habe ich noch nicht gesprochen:\nItems!\nJa, 20XX bietet nicht wenige Items, genannt Augmentations. Diese bieten mit Vorteilen von mehr Lebensenergie oder Waffenenergie bis hin zu h\u00f6herer Laufgeschwindigkeit oder verschiedenen kleinen Begleitern eine wirklich sehr sch\u00f6ne Palette, die den Wiederspielwert enorm steigert. Neben den normalen gibt es auch Prototyp-Augmentierungen, welche sehr starke Vorteile aber auch Nachteile mit sich bringen. So liefert bspw. ein Plattenpanzer guten Schutz gegen eingehenden Schaden verringert jedoch den ausgehenden Schaden. Es gibt noch einige mehr, allerdings sind es zu viele, um sie sinnvoll in die Review einzubinden.\n\nDie letzte Besonderheit, die ich nennen will, sind die Sets:\nAce und Nina haben je einen Slot f\u00fcr Armschienen, Beinschienen, einen Brustpanzer und einen Helm. Insgesamt gibt es 4 Sets, deren Teile im Laufe eines Durchlaufs erworben werden k\u00f6nnen. Entweder findet man die in Kisten oder kauft sie in den \"Scrap Recyclern\", das sind kleine Stores in denen mit eingesammelten (Schrauben-)Muttern Augmentierungen oder eben Setteile f\u00fcr den aktuellen Durchlauf ertauscht werden k\u00f6nnen.

I've never been one for speedrunning and \"mastering\" a level, so the levels rebuilding themselves between plays makes just picking this up and playing it for half an hour exactly what I want, just different enough to be new, but still similar enough to not require much focus. Though it's worth saying that, at these state, the \"randomly generated\" levels are a bunch of \"room/zone\" types that get swapped out and plugged in in different orders, with what appear to be different possible enemy encounters in them as well. So, say a level you see has \"room A, room B, and pit A\". Your next playthrough in that area will likely still have rooms A and B, and pit A, but in a different order. I haven't seen much variation between the same levels and replaying, and while I don't find that to be a problem yet, it would be nice if there's more to come.\n\nThe two biggest problems it has, completely subjectively, are art style and the very roguelike element that I think saves it.\n\nThe art is very plain. The whole thing looks like an early 2000s Newgrounds flash game, and all of the character designs are very boring. This is going up against Mega Man X, whose early years had some very beautiful sprite work. I know sprite art takes time and I'm not complaining that it's not a pixelated game, god knows there's too many of them out anyway and variance is nice, but the characters themselves don't lend to the style either. Plus I just don't like the protagonist designs - rather than having to pick Nina or Ace, just give us a plain GUN or SWORD selection, and then some very basic character appearance customization with heads, colors, and simple accessories like hair or whatevs. I wanna be a s0rd girl.\n\nAnd the roguelike weakness, I feel that there is very little sense of progression. I'm not sure what can be done about this without going against the entire point of being a rogueplatformer, but something about it just doesn't make me want to play again after I die. I get that starting over is the point, but it really feels like I've accomplished nothing. At least Rogue Legacy leaves you feeling like you've put a dent in the game, with your ever growing weapon/gear inventory and stuff.\n\nStill, it's worth picking up and worth going back to. In the current state, the co op works fine, and it feels very fluid with an Xbox 360 controller.

The game is solid enough on its own accord to appease those (IMO) who enjoy this type of game.  For those that like rogue-like games with challenges and what not this game has a lot to offer. It isn't replete with bugs that are game breaking and further development is, as of right now, pretty much guaranteed. It's just not what I was looking for, which is why I originally would not recommend.\n\n--Original Review--\n\nI consider myself a big fan of the original Mega Man series, especially X2/X3, and was very hopeful to try out something new after the massive failing that Mighty No. 9 was.  I ended up picking this up on sale, but I still found it hard to justify the price of what I paid for it, because while this panders to the Mega Man fans, it sadly, is not Mega Man.  \n\nPros:\n-It does sort of capture some of the Mega Man feel with the platforming and some of the character designs.\n-It incorporated newer elements such as daily and weekly trials, as well as speed run options. \n-Has a timer for updates on the main screen. \n-It tries to add a new type of element (rogue-like) to try and keep the game fresh. (Also, see explanations)\n-You can switch between \"Mega Girl\" and \"Zero\" at the main screen without meeting some predetermined type of requirement.  It's a free swap.\n-There's mini bonus missions you can do in a level, gaining a benefit if you \"don't dash,\" or complete the mini-level with other set requirements fulfilled.\n-It has a multiplayer option, though I did not get to test it.\n\nCons:\n-The stylized animations were not to my liking.  They appeared almost childlike at times, overexagerated, and sometimes annoying.\n\n*Update* For clarification, the items in this section are removed from \"Cons\" in order to better explain my opinions on the matter. This section has been renamed to:*\n\n\"My personal opinions because I have an opinion about things and people get butthurt when I don't kiss the golden butt of their digital god, which may or may not be offensive to some so if you get butthurt then just skip this part:\"\n\n-It is NOT a Mega Man clone, for those looking to fill that desire. If you want Mega Man, go back and play the older games, that's the only way to get this anymore.\n-To the Mega Man purist, the rogue-like element is a killer.  There's no way to run through the levels in a specific, orderly manner.  You take what is given.  I was given an ice level once, and a platform heavy sky level about four times.  These are the only two levels I was given.  Maybe something to do with the early access part.\n-To the Mega Man purist, the rogue-like element is a killer.

These are the only two levels I was given.  Maybe something to do with the early access part.\n\nThings to further expect:\n-This still needs a lot of polishing.  This is excusable since it is an early access game, and this is to be expected.\n-Landing on spikes/falling into pits was not an insta-kill like some are used to.  This is a good thing considering that death is weighted much more heavily in this game than a simple \"level restart.\"\n-Boss mechanics were very easy to understand, though at times ridiculous.  They ranged from simply jumping over the telegraphed charge to bullet hell.\n-Future updates may warrant another attempt at getting involved in this game.  Right now though, I'll continue my runs through X2/X3.  \n\nIf you're looking for a game to \"do things\" in, that has platforming/shooting styles similar to the blue bomber, this will probably fit the bill.

Bottom line: this game is a total riot.\n\nI bought this game because I love Megaman X, expecting the roguelike mechanics to be negligable. My biggest gripe with roguelikes is that I usually feel as though the randomly generated stages and items do not significantly affect how I play or force me to adapt. (I love Risk of Rain and Torchlight, but itemization has never affected my playstyle).\n\n20XX uses RNG and roguelike mechanics in a meaningful way. For instance, the playthrough where we got a dash shield vs the time we somehow rolled 3 mario hats and jet boots felt way differently, and even guided how we approached levels. \n\nWhat I liked:\n- Excellent visibility. Screen stretches SSB style so if your buddy screws up a segment or is way ahead of you, it's not disruptive to either of you.\n\n- Option to downsize the UI. The UI blocked me and got me killed a few times but once I downsized it to 75% I never had a problem. (I don't think this would be an issue 1P Solo)\n\n- It's fun to choose different boss rewards and strategize item and power build with your partner! \n\n- With four different character combos (as in, which of you is playing which character), there's a lot of game replayability in a way that 1P Solo might not have. Asymmetric co-op is exciting. \n\nSo even if you're not a big Megaman X fan or are disillusioned with Mighty No. 9, if you want a badass 2P co-op, this is a real gem with heaps of replayability.", "timestamp_created": 1483433029, "timestamp_updated": 1483433029, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500119", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "28969321": {"recommendationid": "28969321", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993812355", "num_games_owned": 17, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 348, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483348106}, "language": "english", "review": "This game was alright the first couple days but then you start realizing that every level feels pretty much the same.

The controls are tight, the sounds are rewarding, the items make sense, and the level generation seems to be working decently. There are many particular configurations of levels that repeat, so there is much familiarity in each level, but the layouts are different enough to keep things from getting too stale. However, the levels each retain fairly distinct personalities, so you begin to get a sense of how each level will play as you get more experience in the game. As the difficulty increases, the platforming becomes much tighter, and hazards become more challenging, but the competent and responsive controls keep things from being unnecessarily frustrating. The movement is insanely rewarding and  enjoyable, especially with movement boosting items and augmentations.\n\nThe bosses are well done, and all fairly different. There is some cheesy damage that doesn't seem fair, especially as the difficulty increases, but it leads to a sort of good kind of frustration, like the pain and pleasure from wiggling a loose tooth.\n\nThis is one of my favorite games right now, and I would gladly pay for DLC with new levels and new bosses. However, it could be very easy for new levels to feel bland in a game like this, and just as easy for new levels to feel like remixes with no new personality if they're just new tilesets with the same old hazards. 20XX has a very large resource of inspiration to draw from for level themes. A couple I can think of now are water themes (ala Bubble Man), or desert themes with shifting sands (like Super Mario Bros. 2) that players can sink into.\n\nOne appeal of Mega Man was having levels that had various mixes of standard hazards, and very particular types of enemies in particular spots on the map. If 20XX lacks anything compared to Mega Man X, it's pacing. The game feels like a frenetic & frantic time trial with pseudorandom enemy generation, and so loses some of the stop-and-go pacing from Mega Man games, such as minibosses, special enemies, and even vehicles & manned armors.\n\nThis is an excellent game in its current form, and if it seems like I want more, it's only because there is so much that this engine could provide. People grow up with particular game serieses, and for me, Mega Man/Mega Man X was pretty high up there. I don't really care for the leaderboard features, and I don't care for the lore, either. What I would prefer is to have many different types of hazards, puzzles, level themes with distinct play styles, and a good variety of bosses.\n\nIf the developers can find some way to make the creation of bosses, levels, hazards, etc. available publicly, I think this engine could serve as the standard for the Mega Man/Mega Man X genre.", "timestamp_created": 1482651752, "timestamp_updated": 1482651752, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543568", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "28613160": {"recommendationid": "28613160", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053656739", "num_games_owned": 95, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 3664, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496883601}, "language": "english", "review": "I absoblutely LOVE this game.

Then that keeps you wanting to stay alive and go even further. Only gripe I have, is that the levels have a certain repetitive design that I hope gets changed to have more boss specific challenges and designs. There is already a hint of it, which is good. Some improvements I hope to see, but are not huge complaints, would be the wall cling/ dash jumping as it can be very finicky, especially for certain platforms and how they are spaced. Also, huge props for the nuts, soul chips, augmentations and the powers aquired. Very creative and really keeps me entertained with new builds I try for each run.

I'd actually tried to write this up before, awhile back, but Steam went \"HERP DERP DURRRRR\" and wouldnt post it.  It does that, sometimes.\n\nAnyway.... 20XX.   The most basic way I always describe this game to people is: \"This is the game that Mighty No. 9 wishes it could be\".  Frankly, some of the actual Megaman series wishes it could be this one, too.  \n\nSo what exactly is 20XX?  Overall, it's a platformer that's extremely similar to the old Megaman X series (on the SNES), with alot of roguelike elements, and even more general brutality than the old games were known for. \n\nStarting things off, you choose from one of two characters:  Nina, who uses ranged attacks, and Ace, who uses a sword (they sound a bit familiar?).  When you begin a run, the game's first stage is chosen at random... you dont know which of the game's 8 bosses you'll be going after.  The old idea of being able to always choose between the full 8 is gone, to prevent players from always choosing an \"optimal\" path... you cant do that now.  When a level ends, you are given a choice of 3 randomly selected bosses to go after.  Since, as you'd expect, each boss is weak against a specific power, this gives the choice of order some weight.  There's more to it than just that though... but we'll get to that in a bit.\n\nThe first thing you're likely to notice (other than the excellent graphics) are the controls.  They are, frankly, perfect.  This game just outright FEELS like that old series did.  You have the same moves, too... running, the sliding dash, basic jumps (right down to the same height), and clinging to, leaping off of, and generally scaling walls. And of course, your weapons... you can fire normal shots, or you can use charged attacks.  Also like in the old X series, there are various suit enhancements; these can give you additional special abilities, such as the ability to double-charge your weapon, or the ability to temporarily fly in any direction for about a second.\n\nThere are also boss powers to use, of course.  You have quite the array of attacks to choose from, and they all have their unique uses.  You've got things like the boomerang blade, which can be thrown in 8 directions, the shockwave, which can smash enemies and cancel bullets in an area around you, or something like the power I call the Death Pixel... you'll see why I call it that if you try it out (it can be charged, give that a try).  Each power is both useful and satisfying.  But not just that, each has an additional special function.  For example, remember those nasty vanishing and reappearing platforms?  Yeah, they're here too.  If you're having trouble with them, and if you have Eternal Star's power, you can smack them with that to lock them into place.  Something like the Death Pixel can smash up vending machines, giving you some free money.  Each of the 8 powers can do something special in addition to it's main function.\n\nNow, this being part roguelike, the different levels you go through are randomly generated, being made of tons of possible \"chunks\".  These are all very well made and they work well together... but the difficulty is very, very high here.  A gazillion traps and nasty foes await you in the horrible hellholes that the bosses call home.  Fortunately, again, this is part roguelike, which means you have a bewildering array of powerups that can help you.  All sorts of ideas, both basic and very unique/creative, can be found as items in this game.  You'll find them in chests, in stores, or as rewards for defeating a boss.  Some of them get pretty quirky, and the more powerful ones almost always have a downside:  Something that gives your basic attack a huge boost might also lower the damage of boss powers, for instance.  Some of them get pretty complicated.  As with many games like this, knowing when NOT to take an item is just as important as anything else.  There are even special weapons for both characters that entirely replace your basic attacks.   \n\nBetween runs, you'll be able to spend Soul Chips (granted from special enemies with massively-buffed HP) to unlock new items, or buy a couple to take with you into your run.   The game has a nice sense of progression, as there are LOTS of items here.  So many.  There are also a variety of modes and difficulties to choose from, including dailies.  You have a ton of stuff to do here.\n\nAnd did I mention the enemies?  There's lots of them, of course, and they can get pretty devious.  Learning their patterns, and also knowing when/how to use boss powers to your advantage, is very important.  It's very easy to die in this game.  The bosses in particular are extra difficult, and WHEN you fight a boss determines how hard it is.  Death Lotus might seem like an easy win if he's the first boss... but if he's number 8, he'll drown you in flowers and horrible exploding things... good luck with that. \n\nOverall, while the difficulty means this isnt for everyone (there IS a \"casual\" mode though), the sheer fun of it, and the incredible amount of polish, make this the \"Megaman\" game I'd always wanted, one with endless replay value and stuff to do (and powers that are actually useful).

The randomness of the powers that you get combined with mix of which bosses you can take on at any given point gives each run its own feel. As I have become familiar with the game I find myself working out different strategies depending on what tools I have available, which influences the choices i have to make as I progress (What to buy at the store, what reward I want from defeating a boss, and which boss I pick next).  As I learned these elements of the game it made starting off fresh each run far less frustrating and has created a more long lasting Mega Man style game than I've had before. \nThe one thing I haven't been able to do is beat what bosses are available without either the double jump or the fly enhancements. This is likely my own lack of skill, but navigating the later stages without it has resulted in death.\nI do think currently the difficulty of the stages ramps up nicely. Playing the Skytemple at level 1 is very different than it is at level 6. Which also leads into the choices of which bosses to take on at any given time.  \n I played the game with the wired 360 controller and I found it to be very responsive. \nThe music is spot on. \nHonestly I'd rather be playing the game right now instead of writing this review.

The gameplay is smooth and fast, it brings something new to the table by being a Roguelike instead of the standard platformer, and there are upgrades that stack on top of each other.\n\n20XX borrows a lot from the Megaman X series, which was ultimately the greatest series in terms of gameplay, barring X7. It has two playable characters, Nina and Ace, who play just like X and Zero. I kind of wish they had included a third character similar to Axl, but, as it is, the variet is nice.\n\nThe game has a number of levels, each of which with a boss at the end. Unlike the Mega Man games, however, you start on a random level, with the difficulty increasing as you beat more bosses. After defeating a boss, you can gain their ability, an increase in health, or some money, all of which are useful. The skills are varied, and I've never found myself considering them copies of the various boss abilities from the Mega Man series, which is a plus. Each boss is weak against one skill, and strong against another. This is once again an improvement against the Mega Man series, and forces you to not depend on a single ability.\n\nHealth and Weapon Energy are rare, and, in later levels, it can be easy to never encounter any. Though you can find them on enemies, they are mostly found in chests, which also usually contain an upgrade. Upgrades have a variety of effects, including increasing your maximum health and increasing your weapon damage. They also usually stack, allowing for large boosts. There are also armor and weapons- the armor functions much like the X series armor, but the weapons are the most interesting. They modify your standard attack, which can be very useful. For example, Nina has a shotgun weapon that has greatly reduced range but fires a spread of shots that together do much more damage than Nina's base weapon, and Ace has a spear weapon that greatly increases his range.\n\nLastly, by doing runs, you gain money, which can be used to unlock new upgrades\n\nMy only issue with this game is that there is no 'endgame', no reason for doing runs aside for unlocking new items, and once that's done, there's not much reason to keep going. Other roguelikes, such Enter the Gungeon and The Binding of Issac, have a story that keeps you coming back, that keeps you going through the game even after you've unlocked every item. 20XX does not.\n\nSo, my final score: 8/10.

This game has been worth every penny I've spent on it and the co-op functionality, although finicky, has been a pleasure to play. I look forward to a few fixes regarding the boss door in co-op locking the client out, and the addition of a final boss/ boss level for after all the stage bosses. Can't wait until this game is fully finalized.\n\nFULL RELEASE EDIT (POTENTIAL SPOILERS AHEAD):\n\nFinal Stages:\nDamn, the game has gotten so much better since this review was posted, with the inclusion of two additional stages at the end of the run, it brought a whole new challenge to the table, the final boss was quite honestly one of the most tense moments I've had in games for a long time and the musical additions with the last two stages are so sublime, the final boss especially. With the Deepstation stages, the elements of all 4 areas you've been to before are mashed together into a gruesome trek to the two new bosses, stage hazards and enemies all band together to make your life a living hell and at the end of it all are two boss fights that take everything you know and force you to apply it all at once in their own unique ways, this was incredibly well done.\n\nGraphics/Art Style:\nAside from that major inclusion there is also a lot of smaller changes that bring the game to life. The graphical changes with the enemy designs and items look excellent, and distinguishing enemies from each other is very easy because of how colourful they are. Each projectile also has a distinct look to it and in turn it makes it easy to spot and dodge. The artist also changed up some of the level tiles and its a decision I completely agree with, seeing Perforator Alpha and Rollster Beta having different looking stages is a nice visual change and keeps the art from getting stale too quickly. One thing I'm unsure about (because of bad memory) is if there have been graphical changes to Ace and Nina since Vile Visage took over as the permanent second boss in  Frostor, BUT the two of them look a lot better than I last recall and whether thats placebo or accurate.\n\nOnline Co-op (With my friend from Peru):\nThe co-op netcode was also polished down so well, my co-op partner and I have run into only one netcode issue since the full release where they got stuck in the boss room ceiling, but it was easily fixable with the newly added TELEPORT TOOL and thank god this is a thing because when you're playing across continents with high latency values it serves as the duct tape for cooperative play. Don't get me wrong though, the netcode is vastly improved, before the teleport tool hit the scene my partner and I ran into netcode issues quite often and now it's only once in a blue moon so good on the developers for improving the online co-op and giving a solution to pretty much every netcode problem. \n\nPermanent Upgrades:\nNow, one thing that was also introduced was the addition of permanent upgrades which I personally don't use but I appreciate the inclusion, for the more casual player, there are upgrades you can purchase in the hub that apply to every run you start, stuff like item drops on certain levels, some chests to get you started, it's a nice way to be able to include any audience not as keen on the challenge of roguelike gameplay. The permanent upgrades of course have to be earned by playing before hand but they're some nice training wheels to get you earning soul chips for new items in future runs.\n\nGameplay:\nAlthough largely unchanged, the gameplay is extremely responsive and tight and it only hiccups a bit when you're walljumping with leg powerups (mainly the hover). Ace and Nina both have their situations they do well in and do poorly in, I personally think Ace is the better character but they are both very usable! There were so many times where I couldn't get close enough to attack an enemy only to have my partner back me up from afar with Nina's buster and there are times when enemies would approach from awkward angles where the buster just can't aim towards, luckily though Ace's saber can hit above himself by a bit so it can help against Flapps on Kur and Eternal Star's stages. Which brings me to another important gameplay element, the stages themselves. The stages in the game are highly defined both visually and mechanically, Ace does better in Skytemple and Deepstation One and I find that Nina tends to do better in Deepstation Two and Vaculab just because of how they are structured. The game doesn't deter you from playing who you want in that sense but no matter who you pick, you gotta be ready for downs just as much as the ups. Jumping and dashing work excellently and wall jumping is mostly smooth (again I'm looking at you Armatort's Momentum). If I take damage I feel like it's my fault for not playing well enough, or not making the right desicions by picking up boss powers (or getting bad luck in my run). However, when you get better at the game, you notice it and it feels satisfying to get better, sure you get bad luck sometimes and sure you start out without the really good powerups but you notice your improvements as a player more than the improvements of the item drops.\n\nStory:\nI'll be the first to admit, I did not care about a story in this game I was here for the gameplay from way back when the Vile Spider was a thing. I was plesantly surprised to see an interesting story in the game. The data lore is rich and intriguing and reading up on characters like Brighton Sharp and Arlan Flat was fascinating. I was only prompted to do this though once I got through to Deepstation Two. Again, this is not a story-driven or focused game, but the little bits of story they threw in was immersive and it felt like it belonged, I really do feel attached to these characters because of this. So way to surprise me with this element I didn't think I'd see much of.\n\nMusic:\nThe music in the game didn't particularly stand out at the time of posting the early access review and it remains largely unchanged, I liked the Vaculab theme but there wasn't any extremely memorable track other than the menu theme for me at the time. But (as mentioned earlier) the release of the Deepstation stages and bosses, bring new tracks to the table and I LOVE them Arlan Flat's theme (which I am listening to as I write this review) is the best thing about the soundtrack, it fits the mood perfectly and keeps the action tense, the same can be said about the stage tracks but Arlan's theme honestly just blows the rest out of the water. Despite the outstanding endgame music, my opinion on the tracks from the earlier levels still stands, they aren't that memorable to me, but the music is amazing in the most important areas so it helps make up for the stages prior.\n\nSide Notes for Devs: \nSo there's a bit of a thing that had me laughing I don't know if it's intentional but I just want to point it out for the devs in case it's not intentional. The wallspook power-up completely ignores Vile Visage's shield whether this is intentional or not, it kinda defeats the point of the fight if I can just sit in front of him spamming my saber and ignoring the enemies he spawns. This also happens with Arlan Flat's Omega Model (although it's a lot less gamebreaking).\n\nFinal Thoughts:\nI bought this game about a year before this edit which is happening on October 29th 2017 and I have gotten so much more than what I thought I was going to get, I absolutely love this game, it showcases how to do early access right. Buy this game, enjoy all that it has to offer and show your support for the developers they worked so hard on this hidden gem of a game and I will be looking forward to any work that they do in the future. \n\nI loved almost everything about the game, I just feel like the game needs some more memorable musical additions, that's all.

It's still fantastic, still worth the money, and still the best Mega Man clone out there.\n\n[End of update]\n\n20XX is what Mighty No. 9 should have been, at least in terms of mechanics. Being a roguelite game, it still has some differences. The game uses roguelite progression where you go between randomly-generated levels and fight bosses that are weak to eachothers powers, but when you die, you're kicked back to the Ark and have to start your run again. The progression comes from Soul Chips that certain powered-up enemies drop, which you can then spend on additional item and weapon drops that will appear in future runs once you return to the Ark.\n\nThe gameplay is very solid, especially for an early access game. It should be said that if you like Mega Man but are wary of 20XX because it's both early access and a roguelite game, it's still very much worth your time. The levels, while largely randomized, very rarely feel unfair and it's possible to clear large portions of the game without taking damage if you're skilled enough. That said, the generation isn't perfect and you can still take unnecessary hits from time to time, and the platforming sections are generally either ridiculously easy or borderline impossible without much in between.\n\nTL;DR - 20XX is fucking great, gets constant major updates and overhauls, and is totally worth the price.", "timestamp_created": 1479261597, "timestamp_updated": 1502991349, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.641960", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26517330": {"recommendationid": "26517330", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039395140", "num_games_owned": 573, "num_reviews": 55, "playtime_forever": 15, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468645074}, "language": "english", "review": "Yay game\n\nGame yay", "timestamp_created": 1478779374, "timestamp_updated": 1478779374, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.434932", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "26512336": {"recommendationid": "26512336", "author": {"steamid": "76561198132215655", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 675, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477033605}, "language": "english", "review": "Phenomenal concept, phenomenal game.

ALL OTHER GAME DEVS TAKE FUCKING NOTE! \n\nthe good.\nthe games difficulty is a bit higher than most games of the action platformer types but generally it's still fair.....for the most part.....\n\nthe weapons are responsive for the most part as well and hit like trucks when you learn to use them right. and each weapon has it's own niche use....well except for one that's overidded later on.\n\nthe power ups are easy to access and there are some that in general are unbelieveably broken, but are limited to having only one of that catagory. not mention when charged this game actually makes the hit box bigger for projectiles. THANK YOU!\n\nthe nutral:\nwhile there is online co-op at this point in time almost no one plays it. so i can't cover that, nor can i cover local mode.\n\nwhile it will take a while the number of stage generations are VERY limited for this game. but makes both a good and a bad thing, so it is nutral.\n\nthe starting area is good as it is, bbut does make me personally wish just a bit that it was more fleshed out.\n\nthe story is hidden within data lore, trasitions between runs, and in the item decriptions. as well as charecter interactions withthe two scientists at the end of every stage who give....\"helpful\"......advice.\n\na mix of synthetic pop and techno that i simply love! but you may HATE. it's well composed, but it's still a group of music that can be GREATLY DISPISED!\n\nthe bad:\ngames that end don't feel completely satifying to me but also to some others who dislike rougelike endings. THIS IS STILL PARAMOUNT.\n\nthe game can get repeditive. very. very. quickly. much to many people's dismay who haven't played in months. some up to a year.\n\nsome items that shall not be named in this section are kinda......iffy.\n\n                                               WARNING MAJOR SPOILERS AND RANT AHEAD IN THE NEXT SETION\n\nPLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF HELL PATCH:\nthe attrociously bullshit stage design in the ending levels for EVERY AREA. i know the game generates based on tile formations but GOD DAMN IT, TRAPS GO CRAZY FOR NO GOD DAMN REASION! to the point that in multiple cases it's the stage hazards that kill you out of bullshit design that relies on you to have something to counter it, when in 90% of the time YOU DON'T HAVE WHAT YOU NEED BECAUSE IT'S RARE AS ALL HELL! OR BECAUSE YOUR NOT BUILT TO PULL OFF WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE!\n\nALMOST ALL ARMOR ULTIMATE MODES NEED A BUFF (still not sure about oxjack since i haven't found all the armor pieces yet) AS NOTHING, AND I MEAN NOTHING, COMPARES TO THE POWER OF OWL HAWK THE GOD DAMN WISE! armatort (as far as i know) is the closest, but he doesn't even get close by a country. since he cuts out 85% of the bullshit traps i mentioned earlier with his hazard sheild and knock back immunity. but draco serphant? nope. the guy who plays to the basic attack is the last place guy? possibly. as half fully charged shots on command are nice, the things are still only half fully charged, they aren't ultra charged, meaning you still have manully charge the shots up, but you don't just instantly charge to ultra, nope you gotta go through all three phases! and unlike armatort who can make up for his kinda seemingly lack luster ultimate, his becomesmore powerful as you face more traps. and there are a WIDE variety of traps that he makes you immune to. owl hawk grants enhanced power damage and effects. key word there, EFFECTS. and those effects don't negat a entire chunk of the armor! meanwhile the dracoserphant the vile nearly comepletely negas the helment!\n\nthen there's  the fact that game HEAVILY tries to force you to use powers and put away your buster! so theonly two playstyles that actually work are hybrid and power ONLY styles of play.\n\nnext up and the reason to the thing prior to this is, and this is no laughing matter for a game like this where it lives and dies by it's replayablity, THERE ARE BARELY ANY ITEMS AND YOU CAN ONLY HOLD 3 BOSS POWERS AT ONCE! NOT MENTION YOU HAVE CHOOSE BETWEN A POTENTAL ABLITY, MONEY, OR THAT BOSSES ABLITY!\n\nugh.....basicly the game needs more items and less bullshit traps toward the end. and a serrious buff to some stuff.\n\nhowever, even with all it's flaws, bull shit and shine is  the game worth it?\n\nVERY.\n\nVERY.\n\nMUCH.\n\nYES.\n\nsure, what i just said in \"this needs to be patched\" is a MAJOR issue that will haunt a LOT of people who like sticking to the only weapons with infinate ammo. but god damn the rest does it's best to cover those issues up and it normally works so, SO god damn well. and it's in BETA. i know people will take that last section as hate, but i love this game, and sometimes you just gotta be honest, you gotta hit something where it hurts if you  want it to improve in this case, and you do it because you love the game. peace.", "timestamp_created": 1477852549, "timestamp_updated": 1477854215, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520245", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "26307635": {"recommendationid": "26307635", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119011182", "num_games_owned": 879, "num_reviews": 73, "playtime_forever": 214, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503448949}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u043c\u0435\u0433\u0430\u043c\u0435\u043d, \u0437\u0434\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430!\n\u0445\u043e\u0442\u044c \u0438 \u0432 \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433\u043e\u043c \u0436\u0430\u043d\u0440\u0435, \u043d\u043e \u0437\u0434\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430)) \u0438 \u0432\u044b\u0433\u043b\u044f\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u0437\u0434\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043e, \u0438 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043e\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u043e.\n\u0444\u0430\u043d\u0430\u0442\u0430\u043c \u043c\u0435\u0433\u0430\u043c\u0435\u043d\u044b\u0447\u0430 - \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u043e\u043d\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f)", "timestamp_created": 1477804805, "timestamp_updated": 1477804805, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494621", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "26270027": {"recommendationid": "26270027", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045543851", "num_games_owned": 55, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 807, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507772663}, "language": "english", "review": "If you like Megaman X, give this a try.

This is the latest iteration. Commentary below may be related to previous iterations of this review.)\n\nREVIEW UPDATED: 09-29-2017\n\nThis is kinda early, considering I said I would update this review when I managed to beat the game, and I haven't yet.\n\nI've been playing on normal mode, and as of the time of writing this, I have managed to beat 4 bosses, only to die in stage 5. And I have to say...\n\n... Y'KNOW WHAT THIS ISN'T HALF BAD.\n\nAnyone who's seen the previous iterations of my review may note that my real only issue with this game was the difficulty. For the record, I have always played in Normal mode. Not hard, not easy, just normal. I always consider this to be the \"intended\" experience of a game, so when I make a review I base my review on the Normal setting of any game. Not easy, I don't need my hand held. Not hard, I don't need my face bashed in.\n\nThat said, my problem was normal felt too HARD on normal. Which, for you hardcores out there might sound like I just needa git gud (but we all needa git gud really. It's how and why that differ). But for a game inspired by MegaMan I was expecting to have MegaMan style fun, and I just wasn't.\n\nI also mentioned in my review that this could easily be remedied by adding a bit more health pickups. Now enemies occasionally drop health, and nuts are a bit more plentiful (which also adds to your survivability since you can purchase health with them).\n\nNow I'm managing to get all the way to stage 5 and I actually have confidence that I can beat the game.\n\nI should note that prior I was playing with a friend in co-op m ode. I was having trouble getting to stage 3 with a friend to help me. Now I can get to stage 5 solo. That is a VAST improvement in the game's balance and one worth tweaking my review from a not-recommend to a yes-recommend.\n\nNow this game feels like a fun MegaMan tribute.\n\n... OHP, I guess I should also talk about other things I like about the game instead of just yammering on about it's past faults and how they got fixed.\n\nAside from that one flaw, I never really disliked anything else about 20XX! It's got nice music, nice artwork.\n\nI think the only music track I dislike is the boss theme. It sounds kinda lacking compared to the stage themes.\n\nFun weapons and powerups. Good music, decent stage design and no instant death-traps like Mighty No. 9.

I also think it would be nice to have the ability to equip one augment in Normal mode just to give us a little extra flavor to play with.\n\nThe fact that it is Rogue Lite makes every playthrough randomized to some extent, which adds a lot of difficulty at times. I wish there were more enemy types as it can be a bit repetitive. It would also be nice if they added more bosses to more guarantee a new set of bosses every play through. New level types would be nice as well.\n\nWould I recommend it? Honestly if you like Mega Man games getting this should be a high priority on your part.

Don't let the weird Newgrounds flash aesthetic fool you; this is a solid and genuinely fun game clearly made by people that actually understand and care about this weird little jump-and-shoot-man \"subgenre\". It already beats Mighty No. 9 in that regard because it's faithful AND it's new mechanics don't clash with the gameplay. Like Beck's dash does. But this is a 20XX review, not a MN.9 review.\n\nSpeaking of the Newgrounds aesthetic, it really is pretty rough. It's not necessarily bad looking, but for the most part it's nothing really spectacular or gorgeous. I might be biased because I dislike puppet/Spine animations to begin with, but the animations in this game tend to come across as rather stiff. The art direction of the cutscenes and some boss portraits also clash heavily with the ingame art, and don't really connect very well to what's actually going on ingame. At least it gets the job done, though.\n\nAs I've said in my previous review, the overall balance and difficulty of the game is pretty mixed but leans towards being too easy most of the time. As of the time of writing this I'm on a 5-win streak, and I've done 6 runs since the game released all in the span of 4 hours. It's kind of difficult for me to say though why this is, because I'm genuinely not sure if it's because I'm really good or if the level and enemy design is a touch too easy, because some other reviewers are claiming it's extremely difficult after a certain point. Maybe RNG is on my side as well, who knows. You could say \"well, why not play the harder difficulty with optional modifiers?\" and my answer to that is \"because it's artificial difficulty, that doesn't change the fact that the underlying game is still a touch too easy\".\n\nThe music on paper is pretty good, but as a budding musician/composer myself the instrumentation is extremely repetitive and almost doesn't change at all from track to track. Cityfires/Brandon Ellis is a great composer and the compositions themselves are also really great (I can't stress this enough), but the overall theme of the soundtrack is just far too repetitious. It's the same few recycled drumsets and modulated chiptune leads throughout, and it needs more variety in instrumentation. I'd like to point to Tee Lopes' Sonic Mania soundtrack as an example of having an incredible amount of variety in your soundtrack, as every track sounds unique even if it's for the same act.\n\nReally though, there isn't anything in this game that screams \"terrible\" or \"don't buy/don't buy at full price\". I don't really know how to end a review properly, so I'll just say that it's good, fun, worth your time and if you're feeling pensive, at least get it on sale.

We'll get into the difficulty curve in a minute.\n\nSo, as far as its Megaman X roots go... this game is pretty damn unapologetic in that regard. I mean, this is lawsuit-levels of similarity - you've got the blue character with a blaster that shoots lemons, you've got the red dude with a sword that can do combos, you've got dashing, sliding on walls, killing bosses to take their weapons, using said weapons on bosses that are weak to them, several armor sets that grant you different kinds of passive bonuses when worn together - yet it never feels like quite a ripoff, as much as it does a loving homage from fans of the old classics. The controls are appropriately tight, allowing full control over your jumping and landing, and stacking your character up with items to boost their movement ability allows you to cross entire sections of levels in a simple double dash-jump. Hitting and destroying enemies (with the blaster OR the sword; as well as a whole bunch of other weapons you can find through the levels) provides satisfying audiovisual feedback, especially when you run into a good amount of strength upgrades which turn your measly 10-damage pea shooter into a 4-way Kamehameha murder pinwheel that pretty much leaves stage hazards as the only threat, given that enemies disappear as soon as you hit the fire button. The level design, while randomized, rarely ever feels cheap (a few leaps of fate are occasionally required, but not nearly often enough to be a problem) and it rewards you for going out of your way to stray from the beaten path and look for hidden items; even though the random generation eventually just starts repeating level layouts, leading to easy uncovering of secret locations (obviously, future updates will add on to this aspect of the game). The boss fights, so far, are sadly kind of underwhelming, as they often quickly turn into a button-mash fest with no real semblance of strategy unless you're really low on health and cannot afford to screw around. A lot of this has to do with the fact that most of the bosses don't feel like badass 1-on-1 robot showdowns like in the X games, but instead involve you jumping around and avoiding projectiles until you can get a few hits on a stationary face on the wall or a pair of beasts that spam fireballs around the room, seemingly unalerted to your presence. But that aside, the Megaman-inspired component of 20XX is beautifully executed, and shows just how much the developers appreciate the playstyle of the series.\n\nAs for the roguelite part, most of the things you'd expect to be there, are there: permadeath, randomized layouts, random item placement and shop locations, as well as a slight overarching semblance of progression in the form of \"Soul Chips\" - items you collect from elite mobs during the levels and at the end of each stage, which allow you to purchase items in the hub world to enable them to appear in your subsequent runs. Other than your standard \"beat 8 levels and you win\" mode (level 9 apparently being in the works as an endgame), you also have the option of daily and weekly challenges (as seen in games like Nuclear Throne), as well as spicing up your run with \"skulls\" - difficulty modifiers that make the game a bit (or a LOT) less forgiving, if you happened to find it too easy for your taste. This is a wonderful addition in my opinion, since the standard gamemode itself doesn't offer nearly enough content to thoroughly enjoy at the moment and its difficulty heavily weighs upon the items you find during your run, so the option to make the levels longer, starting the game off at a higher difficulty setting, making the enemies hit harder etc. is a great idea to keep the players busy until an actual endgame is made. One thing I noticed about 20XX is that the disparity between \"good\" and \"bad\" runs (the ones that shower you with beautifully synergistic items and the ones that give you random irrelevant crap) is way higher than your average roguelite - in games like Binding of Isaac, Enter the Gungeon, Dungeons of Dredmor etc., most of the time you're able to fight your way through by the skin of your teeth even if most of the items you got were terrible; while in 20XX, when you're far off into a run and you still don't have a good amount of strength or energy upgrades because the game just decided not to give them to you, you're pretty much set for death since the later bosses can be absolutely unforgiving to players with sub-optimal loadouts. On the other hand, sometimes the game can feel so generous that you end up beating it within 15 minutes because you have a double jump, an insane speed boost, +38 attack damage to your axe of ridiculous AoE and so many Energy upgrades that you can just spam your fire shield over and over again and not worry about any incoming damage whatsoever. Maybe this was intentional, and even though I kinda made it sound like a big deal, it's really not that bad in the end since the way the game is structured still allows for a great amount of fun no matter the items you find; the runs in which you find said OP items tend to be cathartic killing sprees of joy, while the below-average ones simply range around a fair level of entertainment.\n\nThe presentation is pretty damn good as well, both in terms of graphics and music. Modernized, energetic 16-bit tunes follow you while you blast your way through hordes of colorful robotic monsters (with somewhat of a lack of personality to most of them), and while the story is sparse so far, the creators have promised a great deal of improvement of that aspect in the near future.\n\n[b] TL;DR: [/b] Tight controls, satisfying combat, intense platforming, stacking up your character with upgrades gives a wonderful sense of progression, surprising plethora of content for an Early Access game (with frequent updates on top of that), playstyles of the PS1-era Megaman X series perfectly emulated and tinkered up for the modern era; If any of this sounds apprealing to you, 20XX is worth your money.", "timestamp_created": 1474765953, "timestamp_updated": 1474765995, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25681822": {"recommendationid": "25681822", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081456160", "num_games_owned": 141, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 281, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497398456}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "\u00f3tima jogabilidade e lembra muito os jogos do Megaman, existem v\u00e1rias melhorias que se pode conseguir ao longo do jogo, o problema \u00e9 que estas melhorias desaparecem a cada vez que voc\u00ea come\u00e7a o jogo, cansa ter de come\u00e7ar tudo desde o zero, n\u00e3o tenho tempo para este tipo de jogo, prefiro os que guardam de onde paramos e possibilita continuar da onde estavamos sem ter de recome\u00e7ar do zero.", "timestamp_created": 1474764337, "timestamp_updated": 1474764337, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.428571", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25678747": {"recommendationid": "25678747", "author": {"steamid": "76561197969097167", "num_games_owned": 136, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1668, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497776683}, "language": "english", "review": "     This game is still in development, which normally means I would skip it.

You play as a bot that has either an arm  cannon or a sword. You pick a mode of play when you are in the starting area, which is basically a ship with multiple teleporters. From there, you engage in a platform side scroller. As you complete each level, you get power ups and the difficulty increases. Once you die, you have to start a new run, but you get to use chips to bring some powerups into the start of the next run.\n     I have enjoyed how the challenge scales as you play, as well as the different modes available. The amount of items that drop or can be bought on each run help keep this game fresh.\n     I also like that the developer is still actively working on this title and the added content has been only a bonus to the gameplay. \n     I would buy this game again in a heartbeat!", "timestamp_created": 1474750545, "timestamp_updated": 1474750545, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25675777": {"recommendationid": "25675777", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055614777", "num_games_owned": 113, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1794, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503638217}, "language": "english", "review": "This game suffers from being a pale ripoff of the original with slapped on rouge mechanics which do little more than make it feel badly balanced. After beating it several times my consensus is that it's not worth my time and probably not yours. \n\nHere are some of my problems with 20XX in it's current state.\n\n1. BALANCE. \nThe first few levels are extremely easy, the middle ones get a bit harder(and more fun because of it) but still lacking tons in level design. Many of the levels sections which aren't randomly generated are not that well designed. For example theres a parallell corridor section on one level filled with teleporters. The top ones lead you down to the lower ones and vice versa. This is tedius and without challenge. You go through one wait for the teleporter keep walking and repeat. That's it...\nI'd see if they made some holes on that dissappear and reappear so you'd have to time your teleport more. Maybe even have an elevator instead with some enemies that shoot far-hitting projectiles. \nHowever as it is now you a hint of a shovelware-ish nature. And there are plenty of sections in the game that you start to recognize. 20XXs platforming might make my previous statement unnecessary since the controls aren't made for it and neither is the level design, nor many of the upgrades.\n\n2. PLATFORMING. \nYour character doesn't have any weight. Its twitchy fast control makes anything easy to dodge and feels more like controlling air than controlling an actual character. What makes this even worse when you get the highjump boots or doublejumps:\n\n3. POWERUPS. Most of your powerups make it, again, much too easy. The challenge is completely removed by either having jumps to the moon or a charge shot which destroys enemy bullets. However this very powerup and one of the weapons that also does this is one of the only ways to beat some of the later bosses(depending on which order you take them).\n\n4. ROUTING. Going through the bosses from the hardest to the weakest first makes this game incredibly easy. SO DON'T DO THAT. If you want a challenge and a \"game\" definitely play the weakest bosses first(Chill Penguin and Roll-Around-In-A-Spikey-Wheel).\n\n5. BOSS PATTERNS. The boss patterns go from ludicrously easy pushovers to spewing bullets like Mushihimesama Futari(a great cave shooter you should check out if you like those). It's not that hard tho if you have the aforementioned powerup which destroys enemy bullets. \n\n6. DIFFICULTY CURVE. So it starts off with every enemy taking about two shots to taking 10-15 shots without upgrades. Boss patterns also have a similar scaling problem. Figuring out how to beat a certain enemy is usually a unique and fun experience. Especially in megaman games.\n In this game however, the bosses scale by adding number of shots they take to die. In the end you do a lot of standing still... shooting tediously. \n\nWith an artificially inflated difficulty curve to accomodate the use of upgrades, badly designed levels and a way too easy overall experience... I see this as one of the worst megaman x clones\non steam. \n\nMegaman ZX, ZX Advent, X4, X Corrupted(not yet released), X5(got sooo much bad story and annoying text but if that's overlooked it's basically a poor version of X4), and the Megaman ZERO Games are all more worth playing..", "timestamp_created": 1474740710, "timestamp_updated": 1475517209, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.529777", "comment_count": "6", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25674000": {"recommendationid": "25674000", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036684715", "num_games_owned": 56, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 2210, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511031844}, "language": "english", "review": "I played Mega Man 2 & 3 to death as a kid and when this popped up on my radar I checked out a few videos and it looks great.

I'm a fan of it, but I see why most people don't like it. Part of the rougelike formula, you gain new items through each run. Each item allows for nice individuality for playing; going heavy on damage in exchange for no armor, high mobility builds, a little bit of everything or whatever you come across!

I do hope they keep on adding content, but what's there already is rock solid. \n\nI spent a lot of time playing MMX, X5 & 6 and the controls of 20XX feel natural if you have played the X-series, almost identical.\n\nDo not let the Roguelite element scare you, while the levels may seem hard, they are fair and even though they are randomly generated can be learned since some aspects do repeat themselves. The lack of lives can be harsh at first but you'll learn to pace yourself through the levels.\n\nThe power ups include: alternative basic busters/swords, armor sets that leech life, double jump, air dash, hover (like the ultimate X armour) and many more old favorites. Add to this: challenge rooms,treasure chests and bonusses for clearing levels within a certain time.\n\nLong story short, for 14,99 this is a steal in my book, absolutely love it!", "timestamp_created": 1474146008, "timestamp_updated": 1474146008, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25548255": {"recommendationid": "25548255", "author": {"steamid": "76561198203412952", "num_games_owned": 63, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 2270, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492431256}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantastic controls (on par with megaman zero games which have in my opinion the best 2d controls ever).\nGreat weapons.\nGreat soundtrack.\nReally challanging (especially towards the end)and yet fun bosses .\nGreat level design.\nAmzing upgrades.\nSeriously this game has it all. \n\nAlso don't worry while yes the game is early acces  the creator is really involved with the comunuty.", "timestamp_created": 1474121216, "timestamp_updated": 1474121216, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25537457": {"recommendationid": "25537457", "author": {"steamid": "76561198131376414", "num_games_owned": 163, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 2549, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480980819}, "language": "english", "review": "I've put over 40 hours into this game and haven't gotten tired of it.

It showcases what [i]Capcom[/i] could have made with their franchise but never mananged to accomplish on the later releases.\nIf you are a Megaman (X) fan, this game will suit you as good as a new pair of socks and even better, you are going to love it. For non-Megaman (X) fans, this game has a lot to offer and it's a hidden gem that is challenging and fun.\n\n[b]Pros:[/b] \n\n \u00b7 [b]Randomized stages.[/b] This adds a lot of replayability, specially since the later stages get harder than harder. You may not (or maybe you do, since some of the chunks are kind of memorable) be able to remember the stages, but they're built in such way that even randomized, they're fairly beatable, specially with the power-ups you find;\n \u00b7 [b]Rogue-like elements.[/b] I've seen this in many games lately and sure, a lot of people ain't happy with it, but I'm totally ok with that and it adds more of the \"be more careful with your health, you won't have another chance!\" factor;\n \u00b7 [b]Local AND Online multiplayer.[/b] Another thing I would have loved to see on Megaman X was being able to play as both Maverick Hunters (and Axl, why not) in the same gameplay. Not only that, but they have ONLINE multiplayer (which isn't perfect yet, it works at a playable point). You both same the same power-ups you collect, you can decide whether or not you equip a part of your armor, you both can go with their own post-boss-fight reward... I can't stress enough how much I love this feature, it's amazing!;\n \u00b7 [b]Excellent graphics and music.[/b] It's a 2D jump'n'shooter game and we're in the era of 4K/8K ultra graphics, yet I just can't help to feel the game has a beautiful and colorful visuals, also the music is just perfect for this type of game. I was surprised the first time I heard both Nina and Ace's voice actors, I think they work fine for what they have to say, which is not much but enough;\n \u00b7 [b]Tight and responsive controls.[/b] It plays just like in Megaman X: you jump, shoot, dash, wall-dash/jump and charge, they both operate the same and also share the same feature of remapping the controls (I don't know about the controllers support, all I can say is that the Xbox 360 controller works perfectly), although they limited the amount of special power you can have at the same time, to 3, which I'm ok with, adding into thinking of what to go next with;\n \u00b7 [b]Quite so many options.[/b] You get the chance to play a normal run, a casual run, which lets you add 3 power-ups right off the bat, or add difficulty tweaks to the run, such as making the stages longer, making the game twice as fast, making the enemies deal more damage and/or tougher or even make the game drop little to no power-ups throughout the entire run, and more!;\n \u00b7 [b]Constant updates.[/b] Every 15 days or so, they get an update, updates that make the game better and better, adding just enough so you want to get back to play it again. They do say they may wipe out your save file, but I personally can take the risk of that happening so the game get better;\n \u00b7 [b]And more...![/b] Like I said earlier, the game keeps adding more features with every updates, which are frequent enough so you can tell the differences AND not feeling overwhelmed by them.\n\n[b]Cons:[/b] (which I assume they're working on them)\n\n \u00b7 [b]Lack of plot.[/b] So far, there is no in-game back-story of any kind, all you get is a spaceship (or building, in the later updates) and options on how you want to play the game. Recently they added an intro, which explains a little better what is going on, yet I feel they could tell something more about why it happened, who is the main villain (which takes us to the next point) and who exactly are the people you're being contacted by. Also, [spoiler]I don't get what is this \"Super Safe laboratory\" all about, it feels like it adds as a plot device, but it's not 100% clear to me yet[/spoiler];\n \u00b7 [b]Lack of main villain.[/b] Sure, this game is randomly generated, but if you take, for example, The Binding of Isaac and Crypt of the Necrodancer, you will see that they are rogue-like randomized games with endless possibilities, yet on those games, you have a main villain, someone you want to stop from taking you away from this word, someone you want to get rid off at any cost or to see what is the plot all about, the further you keep playing. 20XX has no final boss/es, just a \"go through these bosses\" and then that's it, a final message at the end of your run;\n \u00b7 [b]One stage for every 2 specific bosses.[/b] This game offered variety, I won't deny that, but the game shares in total 8 bosses (which is not bad) and there are in total 4 stages, meaning that they repeat the layout of the game twice for every two specific bosses you encounter, instead of having 8 different-looking stages. Sure, they are randomized, but I'd like to see more than 4 looking-alike stages.\n\nEven if the game is in its Beta stage, it's 100% recommendable. It's fun, it's challenging, it gets more challenging if you're up to that and you can tell they put a lot of care into it, since they keep adding new stuff and tweaks to make it even more enjoyable. If these cons were fixed, I'd give it a 10/10 right away, but this game gets a [b]9/10[/b] from me.\n\nP.S.: To the creators of this game, if you're reading this, you managed to make me cry of happiness to see one of my most beloved games from my childhood being reborn into such an amazing game as this one is, you deserve more than what I have to say here, thank you very much!", "timestamp_created": 1474049517, "timestamp_updated": 1480189063, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.716618", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25508359": {"recommendationid": "25508359", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043706566", "num_games_owned": 969, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 497, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505446866}, "language": "english", "review": "I was awful at Megaman games, I am also awful at this.

This game falls into that category, at least for me.  A sublime combination of roguelike procedural generation and a specific type of platformer with... well bosses that have weaknesses and... uh... wall grabs... and....\n\nOkay, look, let's not beat around the bush: the non-roguelike mechanics are 96.7% the same as the Mega Man X series. I know it, you know it, [u]dogs[/u] know it. This is generic-brand/knock-off roguelike Mega Man X... and it is [i]utterly [u]fantastic[/u][/i].  Seriously, I had no idea the gameplay mechanics that formed such a large portion of my time on the SNES would work so incredibly well mixed with a dash of randomized level layouts, item pickups, and scaling difficulty. The game itself makes no bones about what it is either, with several subtle and not-so-subtle nods to the actual Mega Man series it clearly draws inspiration from.\n\nThat said, 20XX is not [i]just[/i] a thin copy of that series, and includes a few changes (or arguably improvements) which set it apart. For one, 20XX puts less emphasis on collecting powers and more emphasis on upgrading your character however you see fit, be it damage, speed, movement, special abilities like double jump or flight, or even modification of your basic weapon itself. This ties in well with the randomized order in which level selection choices are presented, as there is no guarantee one can take a boss power and move directly to the next boss who is weak to it. It may be necessary to defeat several bosses without using the attack that exploits their particular weakness. You can choose to do so as well, since taking boss powers is optional, which is vital since you can only hold three boss powers at one time. It may be jarring for fans of the Blue Bomber, at first anyway, but in the end it forces you to make tactical decisions, sometimes very tough ones, but which often feel rather rewarding if things play out in your favor.\n\nNow in terms of changing things there is one specific thing I don't like, and for a very finickey, specific reason: each of the three boss powers you can take is bound to a specific key or button. Why is this a problem? Well, due to the number of buttons required for various in-game actions it is impractical to remap the keys for, say, a classic SNES controller; you're always one button short. You can kind of get around this by either enabling the double-direction-dash option, or by binding something to Select, but in the end whatever you do it doesn't feel nearly as responsive and easy to use as the Xbox controller layout. Yes, I fully and completely understand that most people won't really mind that much unless they're die-hard retro gamers, but I still had to say something.\n\nBeyond that, I am pleased to say 20XX has exceeded my expectations in almost every other measure, with some caveats that I'm willing to overlook since this is in Early Access. There's currently no final \"Big Bad\" level for one, so once you beat all 8 bosses that's it for that run, but the devs have promised a final level once the game is officially released. On the other side of things though, the sound effects and music are absolutely perfect, the music in particular combining various eras of chiptune and synthesizer into a brilliant pastiche of high-energy retro kinetic joy that fits like a glove with the gameplay. Other reviewers have taken issue with the game's art style; personally, I find it both fitting and distinctive, not to mention well done.\n\nThis is without a doubt one of the best game purchases I've made this year. I've already gotten enjoyment out of the game worth well beyond the price I paid for it at PAX (an impulse buy after watching 5 minutes of gameplay, no less).

They did a great job emulating the avatar and camera movement of the Mega Man X series. If you've ever played a Mega Man X game your hands are already accustomed to how the game will play; it is instantly comfortable.\n\nAs far as game mechanics go, outside of the obvious Mega Man X similarities, the nearest parallel is the excellent roguelike, Risk of Rain. You traverse through quasi-random levels, collecting powerups by shooting crates you'll find along the way that enhance various attributes or give you extra navigational skills like double-jump or hover. At the end of each level you encounter a boss who, upon defeat, drops a powerup and their unique weapon. And just like Risk of Rain you can bring a friend with you to run through the game cooperatively.\n\nUnlike Mega Man, you don't have to take a boss's weapon. In fact, you only have 3 slots to hold them so it becomes a balancing act of deciding which weapons to keep and which to drop as the difficulty of enemies and bosses scale up as you get deeper into the game.\n\nI wouldn't worry too much about the title being Early Access. The game is stable and a blast to play. Capcom might never release another X title again, and though it may lack the polished campaigns that the Mega Man series gave us its daily and weekly challenges, coop mode, randomly generated levels, and different game modes make the game infinitely replayable.

It's a game that's designed to be done in runs and played over and over again. The levels are randomly generated, your health is persistent between them and when you die, you die. However, you can purchase items that you can carry forward into future runs, hence why it's a Rogue-lite instead of a Rogue-like.\n\nUnlike Mega Man, while there are many different bosses and each have weaknesses you can exploit with weapons from other bosses, you don't get to pick your order from the get go. Instead, you get to choose one of three bosses to be the next one when you complete a level. In addition to the main mode, there are weekly and monthly challenges, both in standard and hardcore flavours, in which you can compete for leaderboard position.\n\nWhile the controls aren't always quite as tight feeling as I'd like, this plays like a traditional Mega Man game in many ways and I say that as a compliment. Since the levels are randomly generated, you are subject to the whims of the RNG gods a little bit and some levels will be easier than others. However, they always feel well designed and rarely like something the computer put together with an algorithm.\n\n20XX looks, runs and sounds amazing and again, it's incredible that such a small team did so much better a job than a large team with millions of dollars crapped out for Mighty No 9. The colours are vibrant, the character and enemy designs looks great and the game performs very well. It also has an excellent, chiptune inspired soundtrack.\n\nI normally avoid most Early Access games and while 20XX is one at the time I write this, it already has tons of content and I'm still playing it regularly. The developers are updating it every 3 weeks and are providing great communication to the community.

Don't be discouraged by the rouge-like genre. This game still features tight design, so I never was screwed out to a lack of decent items. Speaking of those items, it's amazing how different you'll play based on what you items you acquire. Everything is unique with its own pros and cons. The amount of tactical decisions you make in this game add a deep layer of depth. Decisions such as:\n\nShould I take the boss weapon of aug?\nShould I purchase health, an aug, or save?\nIs it worth it to try traverse an optional part of the level for the item?\nWhich boss should I fight next?\nShould I trade this weapon for another?\n\nThe only two negatives I can think about are the lackluster K&M controls (then again, it is a Mega Man inspired platformer), and the game can get repetitive if levels are played in the same order each consecutive run. If played in a random order, levels will contain different enemies, hazards, boss movesets, and challenges for the player to overcome.\n\nI haven't even encountered a single bug yet either, nor any problems with performance. Just amazing how much a team with a hundredth of the budget, of a certain other Mega Man inspired kickstarter game, can match and even exceed the quality of the Mega Man titles from 20+ years ago.\n\nBTW, the art style of this game is fucking amazing.

Walking past it I had to double back because it looked jsut like Megaman. One of the devs (Chris) Approach me as I was sayign to my bro \"This looks just like Megaman.\" \"That's because it is, a megaman roguelike.\" Played it and immediatly bought it. He promised a megaman roguelike, and that's exactly what we get.\n\nThe classic rock-beats-scissor boss style that defines the megaman series can be found here, even going as far as having certains powers help with certain levels.\n\nThere are hidden power-ups that you can find off the beaten path that feel right at h ome with the megaman gameplay style. From air dodging to blaster power-ups, I've yet to find a power-up that did not feel native the it's inspiration.\n\nThe big selling point is that this is all set in a roguelike! The levels are never the same, and will be filled with different challenges, including challenge rooms that will come upgrades for a reward.\n\nIn addition to the standard game on three different difficulties, the devs run daily and weekly challenges, and two difficulties for said challenges. They also offer a couple different game modes: a speedrun mode and a boss rush mode.\n\nThe replayability for this game is insane, add in that it can be done co-op on the same screen and it will be easy to sink hours into it with a roomate. \n\nCons:\n\n-The character art designs could be better. They aren't bad, but they're off. I actually think it would have looked better to have nina take on the zero role and Ace take on the Megaman role. There are a couple animations used that stuck out as odd for me too. One that comes to mind is the charge up animation for ace. Ace swings a sword, and when he charges up his sword blaster(?) opens up and you see this circle charging. There aren't any big flaws in the character art design, but rather small thigns here and there that stick out in an otherwise fairly polished game.\n\n-Throughout all of PAX, my friends and I were very excited about the game and talked about it a lot, but we called it megaman. None of us could remember that it's name is 20XX. This isn't really a con for the player, but I can see getting the name out there and remembered being a possible issue for the company.\n\n-No static single player campaign or straight forward story, yet. The game is still in early access, and it's possible that an actual story is made and will be added on release. I don't know, and forgot to ask. I doubt it though as this is a roguelike. For fans of true roguelikes, this isn't a con.\n\nPros:\n\n-Very true to the spirit of Megaman\n\n-Great use of having two different genders for characts, but not putting it on a pedastal or drawing unneeded attention to it.\n\n-Lots of upgrades to choose from and power-ups to collect, Progression has longetevity to it, and getting your perfect loadout isn't neccesarily easy or quick.\n\n-Very high replay value, leaderboards, multiplayer, multiple game modes, and daily/weekly challenges really extend the lifespan of this game.\n\n-controller keybinds feel great. One of the highpoints of Megaman was how much finesse a player could accomplish challenges with, and that's present in this game's control scheme.\n\n-True Roguelike, you get one life when you play, and that's it. You die, and you start all over. For easy and normal you can buy power-ups to start with, but they're lost after that run.\n\n\n\nTL;DR Conclusion:\n\nGreat blend of megaman with the roguelike genre. Expect the game to be true to the genre and not have a campaign or driving story. Lots of gamemodes, daily and weekly challenges, difficulty settings for all of the above, and co-op both online and same screen will keep you more than content for hours. If you're a fan of megaman or a fan of roguelikes, I can safely say you will enjoy this. It's a unique roguelike thanks to the megaman influence, and for megaman fans it feels like a never-ending game. \n\nAll in all: 5 star game.", "timestamp_created": 1473156670, "timestamp_updated": 1473156670, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521739", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25376656": {"recommendationid": "25376656", "author": {"steamid": "76561197969020465", "num_games_owned": 311, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 209, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 6, "last_played": 1513570899}, "language": "english", "review": "Played a demo of this in PAX and had to buy it immediately after!

The controls are silky smooth and tight as can be.  The two main characters you play as are obvious mirrors of X and Zero.\n\nThe differences lie in the procedurally generated levels with increasingly difficult bosses.  As you progress through the game on each run, the levels and bosses at the end of those levels all get harder.  And at the end of each level you make a choice on who you want to fight next from three options.  There are small and short challenge rooms which often unlock powerups.  There are four main slots for character powerups that a Megaman X fan would expect:  Helmet, Boots, Chest, Arm.  There is a large range of discoverable powerups in each slot.  For example, some boots might give you a double jump, some might give you an air dash, some might let you hover, or fly.  There is a nice variety of these for all of the different upgrade slots on the character.  There's a LOT more items and basic upgrades to be found for your health and damage as well.  Plus of course you can grab a defeated bosses power if you wish.\n\nThe enemies and bosses are fun to shoot and kill.  It's all challenging. No run is the same.  There are leaderboards for daily and/or weekly challenges.  This game has a very nice amount of content for its relatively small price tag.

The powers you can take from the bosses are all really helpful for a wide variety of situations, with some even carrying extra special effects like Kur's weapon allowing you to loot a vending machine for free. Music is really good too. \n\nThere are a feq minor quips here and there though. The enemy placement can at times be obnoxious, which is due to the nature of this being a roguelike. This is most noticeable in late level versions of skytemple where it sometimes feels like enemies are crammed into sections of the level. The little flying bat things also seem to be way overused and become something of a chore to kill. That and Eternal Star fought at a late level is honestly a bit too much in terms of difficulty compared to all the other bosses at that stage in the game. some bosses later on also feel a bit *too* tanky to where I feels tedious to kill them (I'm looking at you late level visage).\n\nRegardless of the quips this is a game that's a whole lot of fun to play for people who are into the megaman series and even for those who aren't. I've never played a megaman or megaman X platformer before in my life, but damn if this game doesn't make me want to give them a try.

(Which are being added in the current development as well). You can play both as Nina (Mega) and Ace (Zero), and it seems balanced to the point that there's not a \"better character\". \n\n* Difficulty: I feel the dificulty is just perfect, It took me around 25 tries to finally complete a normal run. Furthermore, you can boost the dificulty yourself if you feel the game's too easy with various effects.\n\n* Hopes for the Future: Let's hope the devs can keep delivering and adding even more content as good as the current one (or better!). I'd like to see more bosses, more level segments for the game to generate the level. Some animations, specially Ace's charged attack seem lazy and I think it could be better.

It tried to mix Mega Man X and the rogue-like genre (i.e. The Binding of Isaac, Rogue Legacy, ect). They did a truly amazing job. It plays just like Mega Man X. It has randomly generated levels, giving it all the replay value in the world. It has a lot of power-ups that has similer effects to Mega Man X's collectables. There are two playable characters. Nina who plays just like X and Ace who played just like Zero.\nDispite all this, there are a lot of bugs. It's in beta and it's pretty clear that the game's not finished. You should probably buy it after all the bugs are sorted out.\nWhile I think Mega Man is still better, there's no sighn of a new Mega Man game coming in the future. And, since it's randomly generated, this is the perfect game for anyone who's a fan of the Mega Man series or just platformers in general!\n\n[spoiler] Take that, Mighty No.9!

The game was addictive and was hard to shuffle between other games I play through the day because I always had that thought \"Just one more run\". Now that 1.0 has been released and through all the bug fixes, patches, new tilesets, boss reworks and even new mechanics and now two more bosses but...I will let you find out who those bosses are for yourself ;D.\n\nBut now that I have played and beaten the new bosses (But this is not the last I will play of this game) I can now say without a shadow of a doubt that 20XX is worth the purchase and I highly recommend those who are curious about this game to give it an honest try because you wont be disappointed with what the game has in store for you. If you loved the Binding of Isaac and its RNG and destructively overpowered builds then you will enjoy taking out hordes of enemies with a myriad of different armors from Overpowered charged shots to a Infinite Energy for your special abilities. This is definitely for those who enjoy Megaman X, a fanbase whose hunger for jumpin and shootin platforming has been vastly ignored. Well no longer.\n\nAs for the new stuff I feel like I should not spoil anything for those who have not played the game (But I promised a decent review so I will explain as best I can without confusing anyone.) This game like others like it (Binding of Isaac) excell on the replay value the fun only ends when you cannot think of anything else if you think you cannot do anything more with single player then connect with other people in Multiplayer to expand the chaos and fun of the game by obliterating everything in sight and whats even better? Items, Weapons and even power ups and currency are shared between both players so you dont have to feel left out! And if that does not wet your appetite and want to prove your the top ranked contracter? Then you will be glad to hear that multiple Challenge runs are for you! See how you measure up to the best of the best! \n\nOr if you want to feel adventurous then when you start a new game go to the two other game modes in single player.\n\nCasual where you can either choose 3 power ups to start with rather than nothing or what you can buy from the shop.\n\n If your really feeling brave you can try experimenting with the mutliple challenge modes in Deviant where you can make it as challenging as you can to suit your play style. Such wonderful options such as Toxic which is a mode if you dont beat the level in the time alotted you will lose health until you die. Or maybe you feel there are not enough enemies to blow up then you will choose Swarm to never be alone again as waves of enemies come to greet you (With death of course)! And even Endless and Longer Stage modes that will garentee you will have a ball.\n\nBut thats all I am willing to share because you have to play this game to understand my love for it. It may sound biased but this game gets a solid 100 of 100, 10/10 no matter what ranking I can give it I highly recommend this game to anyone who loves Megaman X, Binding of Isaac or even those who are not exposed to either I would recommend it even those who never heard of either game or played it. What are you waiting for? Go get the game and join our ever expanding community. And to BatteryStaple and everyone tied to this project. I give you a big round of applause for making the dream game that I will waste hours in when im in need for fast paced action.\n\ni Can only hope this game continues to move forward and maybe see new things.

Sinceramente, a ideia de ser roguelike \u00e9 \u00f3tima, e eu n\u00e3o veria problema nenhum se o jogo tivesse diversas fases/bosses que viessem aleat\u00f3rios, por\u00e9m, n\u00e3o procedurais.\n.Como na maioria dos roguelike, tem vezes que voc\u00ea joga e n\u00e3o d\u00e1 sorte de pegar itens bons, drop de hp dos monstros, etc. E em algumas vezes, tu d\u00e1 tanta sorte que chega a parecer injusto a vit\u00f3ria, mas isso n\u00e3o tem muito como evitar no g\u00eanero.\n\n[Contras do acesso antecipado]\n.Poucas fases.\n.Poucos inimigos, o que torna as fases meio repetitivas.\n.N\u00e3o tem um final pro jogo ainda, quando tu chega no final ele diz \"parab\u00e9ns, clique aqui pra voltar pro menu\", bem broxante haha.\n.Achei o menu in-game meio confuso, sinceramente eu preferiria uma interface padr\u00e3o, com menu de escolhas.

They added a bunch of bloat to the game that made it more random, and less fun overall. The difficulty curve is all over the place and I no longer feel it was the game I purchased. It's completely different now.\n\nYou'd think adding more items, and challenges to the game would make it more interesting, but no. The game can go from really challenging to absolutely bananas difficult without warning.\n\nWhy are there 3 different health upgrades now? Nearly every stat boosting item in the game has been given at least 3 different versions, you'd think this would make the game more interesting but it only adds more randomness. \n\nThey changed just about every single boss in the game, a level 1 boss used to be a really straight forward affair, with the difficulty ramping up with each successive level completed. It was really fun to try bosses in different orders to see how the progression effected their attack patterns and strategies. THIS IS NOW WHAT A LEVEL 1 BOSS LOOKS LIKE AS OF THIS DATE.\n\nhttps://i.imgsafe.org/dd14ea0ff1.jpg\n\nThis is absolute god damn nonsense. This is not hard mode. This is not some weekly hardcore challenge. This is the baseline difficulty for a level 1 boss.\n\nThe game used to have an absolutrly DELICIOUS difficulty scale. It was almost perfectly tuned.\n\nThis is just a small sample of what the game throws at you now.\n\nhttps://i.imgsafe.org/dd2aee6435.jpg\n\nNotice the gamefield behind the game over screen, and not the Game Over screen itself. The right and left wall, and ceiling are covered in spikes, when you pass directly in front of these spikes, they will launch an icicle at you, dealing damage, the three beehive looking enemies in the middle shoot mines that track the player and stick to you, If you do not enter the green spheres before the 3 seconds are up the mines will explode and deal damage, if you do, they are disarmed. Notice, now, the black bar looking objects in the room. The objective is to touch all  of these objects to activiate them, and unlock a piece of armor. Are you a bad enough dude to do all of this in less than 15 seconds, without dying, or taking so much damage the reward is no longer worthwhile, because you still need all that health you lost trying to defeat the boss in the earlier screenshot?\n\nThe point I am trying to make it that at no point was this game EVER so outrageously difficult. On Defiant, or hardcore, with skull mutators on? Yes. Absolutely. Challenge accepted. This is the normal difficulty now, though. Normal. Baseline. It only gets more outragoeus from here. These examples are from the first 3 levels of the game. This is not a case of getting better. The game is so frustrating to play I DO NOT WANT TO GET BETTER. I want to eat my arm in rage. It is frustrating as hell watching one of my favorite games ever to play and relax with get turned into something akin to Cloud Berry Kingdom, or Rogue Legacy. I do not find those games fun at all. I no longer find this game fun at all..\n\nThe last 3 months of updates have absolutely ruined this game for me.\n\nI loved this game so much I bought it 4 times so my friends could enjoy it too. \n\nIt seems that I am in the slim minority of people who were disappointed in the direction this game has taken, but the only people the developers are interested in catering to are Speedrunners with laser like reflexes.

Yes its in Early Access but let me tell you this game is GOOD very Good even in its current unfinished state. This game is going to be a massive hit Massive because the replay value is so high. You play as two characters Nina which is your representation of Mega Man and also a Zero clone (can't remember his name) who has a sword as his main. The game has coop too which just adds to the replayablity of this game.\n\nGraphics: A cell shaded look kind of cartoony but feels like a mix of the old nes and snes mega man games. The graphics get the job done for this retro style game.\n\nMusic: HOLY HOT DAMN this is good. This is the best part of the game imo. The game is worth the price of admission for the sound you get to treat your ears to this kind of goodness. 10/10! \n\nControl: Ok I am going to be honest when I say this but this game has prob the most responsive controls in any game I have ever played. You feel like you are in 100 percent control of your movement and where you go. If you miss a jump its your fault.\n\nReplay value: With random generated levels, daily challenges and challege modifiers this game could last you forever prob. \n\nThis game will prob end up being one of my all time favorite games because it takes elements from some of the best games ever like Spelunky and Mega Man. There is something exciting about playing these types of games because every run will be different due to the powerups you get just like Spelunky which is one of my all time favorites.

Gameplay wise the controls are tight and responsive, the enemy/boss variety is really good, the power ups/augs really add to the game each time you play it (I particularly like the \"evil\" items), and the scaling difficulty is really cool too. \n\nNothing like fighting a boss on stage 1 during one run and then coming back and fighting them again during another run on stage 7.

The platforming bits aren't even a chore--being able to blitz through them once you learn how to is sooooo satisfying.\n\nSecond, the items are great. Their impact, their availability, and the fact that they are infinitely-stacking makes collecting items a joy. And the joy remains, no matter what point you are at in the game. (Unless you are jumping out of the map.) Collecting items in some other games (like Enter the Gungeon) doesn't feel nearly as rewarding and are much more annoying to get.\n\nThird, the scaling difficulty system in this game is pretty awesome.

The player has to always be aware of the platforming sections, no matter how many speed/jump upgrades they've gotten.\n\nFourth, the multiplayer. Both local and online.

A l'heure o\u00f9 j'\u00e9cris, je ne me sens pas l'envie d'y rejouer plus que \u00e7a. Des fois quand j'ai envie de perdre 10 minutes \u00e0 jouer \u00e0 un jeu avec une manette pour me d\u00e9tendre, mais sans plus...\n\nLe jeu est tr\u00e8s bien cod\u00e9, il est fun, mignon, les musiques sont sympas, c'est vrai. De plus, il est tr\u00e8s suivit, avec m\u00eame un compte \u00e0 rebours annon\u00e7ant les mises \u00e0 jours. L'action est dynamique... moui, plus ou moins. Autant les phases de plate-formes peuvent \u00eatre hardus et offrir un r\u00e9el challenge (enfin, sans pour autant \u00eatre punitives), autant les ennemis sont une vraie blague.\n\nPeut-\u00eatre que c'est \"trop\" dynamique. Moi qui ai vraiment l'habitude des Megaman sur NES et SNES, o\u00f9 les d\u00e9placements sont plut\u00f4t lents et il faut r\u00e9fl\u00e9chir \u00e0 l'approche des ennemis, tout \u00e7a coupl\u00e9 \u00e0 une vraie difficult\u00e9. L\u00e0 c'est tout l'inverse : le personnage cours vite, saute haut, peut dasher + sauter, mais les ennemis explosent en un ou plusieurs tirs, tout en n'offrant pas de r\u00e9el r\u00e9sistance / mani\u00e8re de vous infliger des d\u00e9g\u00e2ts. L\u00e0 o\u00f9 Megaman est assez punitif, comme le retour au d\u00e9but du niveau \u00e0 la mort en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, ou la barre de vie qui se vide rapidement car elle se recharge \u00e0 la fin du niveau, 20XX fait dans la demi-mesure : le jeu est un peu plus \"survie\", genre la barre de vie ne se r\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e8re pas \u00e0 la fin du niveau, donc pour que le joueur continue de jouer sa partie, il ne faut pas le tuer de suite...\n\nEt c'est s\u00fbrement ce c\u00f4t\u00e9 \"on fait du mal au joueur petit \u00e0 petit\" qui me fait dire qu'il n'est pas si difficile que \u00e7a. La mort au contraire, est une lib\u00e9ration, vu qu'on va s'emp\u00eacher d'acheter des objets pour \u00eatre plus fort.\n\nLes boss sont une rigolade, comment on les explose facilement et comment eux gal\u00e8rent \u00e0 nous faire du mal. Dans Megaman, fallait \u00eatre minutieux pour s'adapter aux paternes des boss, dans 20XX on leur roule lit\u00e9ralement dessus, quitte \u00e0 y laisser 2-3 points de vie au passage...\n\nLes phases de plate-forme sont presque \"skippables\" si vous lootez de quoi \u00eatre plus rapide / sauter plus haut.\n\nQuand aux capacit\u00e9s sp\u00e9ciales suppl\u00e9mentaires, elles sont trop basiques et jetables, on a pas le temps de s'y attacher. Dans Megaman, quand on a un nouveau pouvoir, on est tr\u00e8s heureux. L\u00e0... bof quoi, mon flingue / mon \u00e9p\u00e9e fait d\u00e9j\u00e0 tr\u00e8s bien le taf... \n\nApr\u00e8s, c'est vrai qu'il est tr\u00e8s fun \u00e0 jouer au d\u00e9but. Surtout si vous jouez en coop (m\u00eame avec un inconnu). On a acc\u00e8s \u00e0 deux personnages.\n\nMais pour toutes les raisons que j'ai cit\u00e9, malheureusement le jeu ne m'attire pas assez pour y rejouer. Pas assez punitif, pas assez difficile. Je le garde de c\u00f4t\u00e9 pour les jours o\u00f9 j'aurais envie de me faire un Megaman Like avec de beaux graphismes, mais malgr\u00e9 les ressemblances, il en est quand m\u00eame tr\u00e8s loin.\n\nIl peut \u00eatre fun, je ne vous le d\u00e9conseille pas non plus. J'affirme que ce jeu n'est pas du tout une arnaque, vous pouvez y aller les yeux ferm\u00e9s. Juste que moi... bah il ne demande pas d'efforts aux joueurs quoi. Un passe temps o\u00f9 on saute et on tire sans que \u00e7a soit difficile. Si \u00e7a vous plait et si vous cherchez un Megaman en coop \u00e0 2, pas difficile, pourquoi pas.\n\nAh, et y a aussi du fan service et j'ai horreur du fan service.

I really really wanted to recommend this game, but I can't. There is not enough material here for a person to play alone, and honestly it feels like most reviews are made by people who despise Mighty n\u00ba9 over trying to make a fair review.\n\nI will start by saying this: The developers are very active in improving this game, but as it stands, the game has a lot of issues with its RNG. \n\nThere are many enemies that spawn in ridiculous places, like just where you can land to the next platform over a huge gap, or making bosses having random 360 attacks with no previous warning. Megaman had this right: for as little time as you might have to dodge an attack, the attack pattern was something that you could learn, or atleast forsee what attack was going to be performed. In here, bosses just randomly use a 360 attack as you progress the levels and they become harder. \n\nUsing [Totally Not Zero] feels awesome, but its pretty obvious that the game wasn't designed for you to walk around with a melee weapon when most enemies attack from huge distances, specially bosses. Fighting a high-leveled Hamster boss where, on death, spawns 2 tinier hamsters becomes a pain in the ass for [Totally Not Zero]. The penguin's dash is very unpredictable, and this becomes a problem when you use [Totally Not Zero], not to mention the spikes that get shot at you in later levels if you face him or any other boss on the ice level. \n\nThere are several more issues with the remaining bosses, but I won't even go into detail. It feels like with a bit of polish, it might work well, and add in a more extensive story would be really cool. Something that would really want to make you play the single player. As it stands, there's a huge skill difference between going through a level and fighting a boss (this is actually a problem that is also visible in the original Megaman X games).\n\nI think the longer it strives to improve, and the longer it tries to separate itself from Megaman the better. There are many things in this game that I look at that weren't in the original megaman and I really enjoy, such as most powerups and the random level design and how some bosses work, but then there are also plenty of problems that are inherit to the original Megaman games, that were straight out copied and pasted onto this game, where it just seems to not blend in very well.\n\nAgain, I really want to recommend this game, and for all effects and purposes, it is superior to Mighty n\u00ba9, but I also feel like it should strive for more than \"I'm better than Mighty n\u00ba9\" which is honestly not a hard feat to accomplish.", "timestamp_created": 1468771781, "timestamp_updated": 1502916376, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496806", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "24372546": {"recommendationid": "24372546", "author": {"steamid": "76561197980798115", "num_games_owned": 756, "num_reviews": 67, "playtime_forever": 11943, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504556941}, "language": "english", "review": "Outstanding game, hard to believe this is early access.

Combined with the fact that levels increase in length and difficulty depending on how many levels you have already beaten that playthrough makes each level very different each time you play it (you only get to choose 1 of a random 3 levels after each level, so you can't play the same order every time).\n\nThe UI has been VASTLY improved, instead of only being able to equip 1 weapon and having to cycle through all the others to get to the one you want, you can have up to 4 weapons equipped to 4 different buttons and fire any of them at any time. All boss weapons share the same ammo' pool (NRG -which is displayed constantly under your health bar) eliminating the need to swap weapons to refill each of them and even the buster / saber themselfs can be swapped out for other weapons / attacks (all main weapons are infinite).\n\nIt also has mutiplayer for co-op, you can both be the same charecter if you want, (more modes *MIGHT* be added in the future, but that's just speculation), it has a casual mode and a normal mode which you can modify with a fair few handicaps (\"skulls / poisons\") it has a ranked daily challenge where you can only try once a day with no starting bonuses, a daily hardcore which is the same but with 3 random handicaps active. It also has a weekly challenge which is the same as the daily but can be tried as much as you want, the weekly hardcore is the same but with 3 random handicaps.\n\nYou find \"soul chips\" on powerful enemies (not bosses) that you can spend on unlocking new upgrades to find during a playthrough, once you have them all you can use them to buy up to 3 random augmentations to start with in normal or casual mode inbetween playthroughs. In your HQ you can see what you can unlock, what you already have unlocked, swap characters, see the shop or choose any of the 8 modes (casual, normal, normal+ (<-- Normal with handicaps), daily, dailyHC, weekly, weeklyHC and co-op). \n\nWhile it can be played with a keyboard it is mainly optimised to use a 360 controller, which I can attest works pretty well, you can change your equipped weapons to X (main weapon) LB, LT, and Y. You can presumably edit the button layout more but I haven't tried that yet, to be fair I haven't needed to (there is a discalimer at the start saying that the game was meant for 360 controllers and using anything else would possibly have issues).\n\nThere is a leaderboard that covers pretty much everything, there seems to be a *tiny* bit of hacking going on there, but not much (unless it really is possible to beat the game in under 2 min's). There's also a local 2 player mode so your mate can just plug another 360 controller in a play with you, I don't know if it's split screen (as you would expect) or if it's a San Adreas sytle \"both players share the same screen and if they don't work together they're gonna have a bad time\" kinda deal.\n\nAlso a good price, even more so if you get it on offer.\n\nThe bad:\n\n\nThe 2 charecters appearence looks a little..... \"flash-e\". It's not really an issue while playing (or at all for that matter), you won't notice it because everything's kicking off, but if you stop and look at your character, they look like they were made in a flash game. A very polished flash game, but a flash game nonetheless. After the rest of the game does so well it's just wierd to see the main charecters not look like they belong there, it kind of looks like how Raiden from Mortal Kombat 3 would look if he were in Mortal Kombat 10. To be fair it is still in development, they might be place holders, they might be focusing on other things first, I don't know. The characters just look a little..... \"flash-e\" at the moment (espesically during Aces' standard attacks).\n\nThe only playing option right now is the story, there are lots of modes to play it, but considering at the moment it's completely void of any story, it's not much of a story, it's more of an arcade. You have 8 levels to beat that are majoritly random, and that's it. You get a lot of replayability from that one mode, but once you get board of those 8 levels you're board of the entire game.\n\nThere are other modes that they could add, taking from Megaman again there's the infinity mode from Megaman 9 (or 10?) where you go through infinite areas back to back without bosses and the amount of areas you cleared is your highscore. Or even a 1 v 1 mode like they supposedly did in Megaman and Bass (we didn't get a PAL SNEZ release /cry), perhaps 2 v 2 or handicap matches, maybe even a tournement mode. It is still in development though, so maybe there will be more modes, but maybe not.\n\nIt doesn't have much in the sense of story or collectables, perhaps they could tie them together in another Megaman fashion, like either the chips from Megaman Zero or the discs from Megaman and Bass. The levels just don't give you any real incentive to look closely at them, if there's a secret path you'll see it, it consists of about 4 platforms that you can see from the main path, you don't have to look to find them.\n\nMultiplayer is wonky as **** right now.\n\nAchiv's would be nice.\n\nThe Ugly:\n\n\n7 / 10\n\nA great arcade game so far, it is still in development but even if it stays as it is it's a pretty good Megaman experience. It could be SO much more though, I don't want to sound ungrateful or greedy, but now they've got the platform for it it's entirely possible to make it so much better. It's only downsides at the moment are cosmetic or simply not in the game *yet*. The only real problem is the lengh of the game, you're only getting 8 levels (at this point in time), you can play them a lot of different ways and for a lot of different reasons, but those 8 levels are 100% of the gameplay.\n\nI would love to see more ways of playing.", "timestamp_created": 1468015251, "timestamp_updated": 1468421065, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.568430", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "24184645": {"recommendationid": "24184645", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078195804", "num_games_owned": 829, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 801, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498507598}, "language": "english", "review": "Really fun game.

Get it. The hours you'll get from this way outweighs the cost.\n\nLet's get the obvious out of the way. This is a much better Megaman X game than Mighty No. 9. I got into 20XX after MN9. While MN9 is not that bad, it's a very infuriating game, mostly because of the dash-kill mechanic and because of the extremely cheap level design. I didn't like the graphical style at first and ended up almost returning the game. But once I got used to the graphics and understood the systems, it became very fun. \n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nWhile 20XX plays very similarly and has its roots in the original series, it is by no means a Megaman X game clone. It takes parts of the formula it likes and assimilates it. The rest, it blends up and either throws out the window, or is presented to you in another form. \n\nIn terms of combat, 20XX has a large diversity of weapons. You have the traditional abilities that you can absorb from the bosses (or you can forsake the abilities and choose to either gain 10 nuts, the currency in the game, or for a random upgrade), and a bunch of different weapons for both characters. That's right: Zero isn't the only one getting new weapons like in X8. X also has a bunch of weapons for you to find.\n\nMovement feels the same as MMX. You have double jumps, hovers, air-dashes, wall-clings, wall-jumps and sticky ceilings. Players familiar with the MMX series will be right at home here.\n\nLevel design feels more challenging than cheap in most situations. There will be many enemies, and many crevices and traps to fall into. Hell, on high enough levels, you'll feel like 20XX also has some element of bullet hell built into it. In that situation, the game can be a little cheap, but at that point, you're likely to have enough health to be able to take some cheapness. In fact, your armor pieces themselves are also very cheap, so it kind of evens out a little. What is striking is that all instant-death situations in MMX instead take life from you. In that sense, 20XX is more accessible.\n\nIf that sounds too easy for you, the game has many different \"skulls\" that you can enable to make it more difficult. No upgrades? Enemies do way more damage? Enemies last longer? You never run out of stages to run through? Sadists who find the fixed difficulty of MMX too easy will be delighted at the skulls system.\n\n\n[b]Replayability[/b]\n20XX follows the MMX formula very closely, but mixes things up by introducing a roguelike element to the game, making it very replayable. \n\nLevels are procedurally generated through sets, and a level editor is currently in the works to allow players to create their own level sets for use in the game.\n\nYou will come across many different pickups in the game, and what was done away in terms of exploration (which rewarded you with armor pieces, tanks and hearts in the original series) was replaced with a multitude of mechanics: Glory Zones in every level past the first level which reward you with 1 of 4 armor pieces (collect all 4 of this to feel like you're cheating), and a simple upgrade system which lets you increase different aspects of your character through upgrades called Augs: attack damage, power damage, speed, jump, maximum health, maximum energy, armor, and a bunch of other cool things like sucking in pickups when you charge your attacks, \n\nOn very rare occasions, you also come across a Prototype, which gives you a massive boost on one end, and a massive debuff on the other end. For example, you can find one that lets you do massively increased damage, but take double damage. \n\nPrototypes are the embodiment of decision-making, which is something you will find abundant in the game. Do you pick up the power? Do you need nuts (the game's currency)? Is this Prototype going to be good for my current setup? Do I want to gamble and hope I get a System Restore (another Prototype that removes all debuffs but lets you retain all buffs from whatever Prototypes you pick up)? \n\nThere are many permutations of such decisions that you can make in a game, and they all work towards making the game insanely replayable.\n\n[b]Music[/b]\nMusic is presented to you in a chiptune fashion, so older gamers may really like the nostalgic element it lends the soundtrack. \n\nMusic is very upbeat and has a similar uplifting style to the soundtrack in the original series which will make the most cautious players want to rambo their way through the entire level (and die in the process). \n\nMy personal gold standard for the soundtrack in the original series would be in MMX3, specifically Blizzard Buffalo's stage. Careful use of droning synthesizers conveyed a feel of, and I paraphrase a quote from a random Youtube comment (because everyone on the Internet is a music expert), \"The sadness as Blizzard Buffalo's city ended up being frozen.\"\n\nYou don't get that here, because, frankly, who has the time for introspection? What you get is awesome, catchy and epic-sounding soundtracks. It is a little repetitive though, especially given the replayability of the game, but nothing is stopping you from putting on some of your music, or even some of the themes from MMX. I suspect the developers knew this even before players got their hands on the game, but the alternatives would be to have either no music (which is ridiculous), have such a large soundtrack that players don't get bored, or to have music be generated on-the-fly. The latter solutions are too costly, given that the game is still so young.\n\n\n[b]Summary[/b]\n20XX is good, great fun. If you're a fan of the MMX series, you won't regret picking this up. Many changes have been made to the game since its inception. The most striking for me is that Glory Zones which could be impossible for a certain setup (such as encountering one where you had to use only powers; this made it imperative you always picked up the first power you came across to prevent this from happening) to complete in the past have been removed. This is a game made by gamers, for gamers.\n\nI give the game nine wrong armor pieces dropping from a Glory Zone out of ten.", "timestamp_created": 1467961798, "timestamp_updated": 1503744427, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24172257": {"recommendationid": "24172257", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077066954", "num_games_owned": 122, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3459, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511807388}, "language": "english", "review": "dont trust sketchy lab teleporters", "timestamp_created": 1467944995, "timestamp_updated": 1467944995, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "24163040": {"recommendationid": "24163040", "author": {"steamid": "76561198141744896", "num_games_owned": 81, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2814, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507930799}, "language": "english", "review": "When your crappy lappy is so bad it can only maintain 30 fps in this game yet you play anyway that says something.\nAlso wont make you cry like an anime fan on prom night.", "timestamp_created": 1467915412, "timestamp_updated": 1467915484, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499775", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "24158088": {"recommendationid": "24158088", "author": {"steamid": "76561198033474597", "num_games_owned": 175, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4393, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512536063}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome game, a great mix of old and new concepts.", "timestamp_created": 1467901115, "timestamp_updated": 1467901115, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "24156215": {"recommendationid": "24156215", "author": {"steamid": "76561198142413450", "num_games_owned": 176, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 911, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502330531}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "cara o jogo \u00e9 muito bom lembra muito um Megaman X estilo roguelike\nrecomendo para quem esta muito frustrado com o Mighty, e para aqueles que n\u00e3o est\u00e3o tbm, \u00e9 bem divertido e da para passar o tempo se vc curtir o estilo roguelike com uma dificuldade media/alta", "timestamp_created": 1467894932, "timestamp_updated": 1467894932, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "24154888": {"recommendationid": "24154888", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961585342", "num_games_owned": 482, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 244, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502892263}, "language": "english", "review": "Beforehand: The game is already good at it what it is. If you like MMX, \"platform puzzles\" and roguelikes this is the game for you. If you expect a Mega Man X/Zero/ZX game with a \"endless\" mode, you'll be heavily disappointed. Also I'm writing this review from the point of view of a extreme hardcore MMX/Zero/ZX fan.\n\nAbout the Devs: Extremely responsive, care about the reviews (ask whats wrong with the game on a negative review etc.), listen to players, release regular updates. Thats exactly how early access should work!\n\n-----------------------\nReview:\n\nOh what was I excited when I saw 20XX for the first time. Finally a worthy successor of the Mega Man X heritage? Not exactly. The controls are great, the \"shooting\" feels also great and the game itself feels really like MMX but then... there are the stage designs and some other things. You probably think now \"Of course the stages are a bit strange due to the procedural generation etc.\" But no, thats not the problem. The problem is that the stages are basically a concatenation of \"jump on small platforms\" parts, they're basically everywhere which is really annoying. Yes of course, this stuff was also present in MMX but not as much as in this game. You encounter more or less difficult \"fallpits\" every 5 seconds.\n\nAnother point is that I don't like the rogue like elements very much. One of the coolest thing in MMX was that when you couldn't beat a boss, you could come back later with some nice upgrades and beat him. Now if you die, basically all your stuff is gone. However, this doesn't effect the rating of this review, since I knew from the beginning what kind of game I had to expect.\n\nI would really love to see a \"traditional\" mode that would allow you to keep the stuff you've collected in stages/runs. Probably balanced by having multiple lifes for the whole \"game\" - if you run out you have to start over. I also suggest to add a function to turn off Nina's hairstyle. It's just a minor thing but somehow the hair bugged me (although it's nicely animated). Would have prefered a \"classic MMX helmet hairstyle\" (Ciel or Zero).\n\nSo can I recommend the game? If you're \"just\" a MMX fan: Not really, maybe, I don't know to be honest. On the other hand, if you're a MMX fan who likes rougelikes then this is probably the game you always wanted to play. But for me it's sadly not the holy grail I expected it to be on first sight.\n\nAnother note: I have to disagree with the comments about the music. It's not at all like the music of MMX (it's good but nothing really special imo). The music in the game are mostly chiptune like tracks which were never present in any MMX game as far as I recall (except for the secret boss/mode in MMX8 and ZXA). The music in Mega Man X has always been inspired by the music of 80s (for the most part, excluding MMX2).\n\nEdit: The game is rather difficult if you don't have a certain upgrade early on and you maybe fail in one of the next stages if you have some bad luck or the rng gods don't smile on you.", "timestamp_created": 1467889854, "timestamp_updated": 1512154423, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24150598": {"recommendationid": "24150598", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068102464", "num_games_owned": 345, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 23, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467406689}, "language": "english", "review": "Fuck MN9, this is way more of a megaman successor than MN9 can even dream of being.

You.  Lookin' at this review.  Let me ask you a question.  Do you like AWESOME things that are AWESOME?  Then you gotta play this game, dude.  It's friggin' cool, and CRAZY addictive.  Like popping BUBBLE WRAP addictive.\n\n20XX is a Mega Man X inspired roguelike, and unlike another recent Steam release that takes its inspiration from Mega Man, it won't make you cry like an anime fan on prom night.\n\nThis game comes with two playable characters, Nina (X) and Ace (Zero).  Each has a standard weapon, but new ones can be acquired in stages, and more can be unlocked through play.  When a boss is defeated, you can choose to take their power (Which another boss is weak to!) or an enhancement or the game's currency to buy things in stage shops or vending machines scattered around the stages.\n\nAs the game begins, you start in a random stage with weak enemies and a fairly small amount of set pieces.  As you progress through stages, enemies get tougher, stages get longer, more items and abilities drop, and you can acquire armor pieces that, when a complete set is formed, gives another bonus!  Once completing a stage, you're given the choice of up to 3 stages to progress to, until all 8 bosses have been defeated.   Once you defeat the last boss, the final teleporter ends the game and gives you a score/recap.\n\nIf the game gets too EASY for a PRO like you, you can enable Skull modifiers, that do things from make stages longer, start stage generation at level 5, increase enemy count, remove drops from the game, remove specific bonuses from the game, make pits/spikes instantly kill you, speed the game up, double enemy damage, etc.\n\nIf the game is TOO HARD for a CASUAL like you, or you feel like dicking around being overpowered, you can begin a casual run with 3 of the items you've unlocked.  It can be cathartic to tear through enemies with a ton of power bonuses.\n\nIf you really have an itch to scratch for a Mega Man X game and can't wait any longer for MMX Corrupted, I cannot reccommend this game to you enough.", "timestamp_created": 1467844008, "timestamp_updated": 1467844008, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 22, "votes_funny": 17, "weighted_vote_score": "0.692754", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "24138174": {"recommendationid": "24138174", "author": {"steamid": "76561198203448320", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 816, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508592104}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is quite good.

The bosses get harder the later you leave them, allowing the game to feel like it always has a steady difficulty curve no matter how you play.\n\nWith the bosses, enemies, and platforming in mind, there is an interesting mechanic to try and set up a route of play where your skills are best expressed at a particular time. If you have troubles with platforming, you may try to set up some bosses and their environments earlier, or if you have troubles with a particular boss, you may try to face those bosses as soon as possible.\n\nThe items all feel good to use, and I rarely feel like an item has ruined my game without me knowing it could. However, there was one time when my friend and I were playing two-player and he killed me by picking up an item that increased offensive power but decreased health. We were able to laugh it off and avoid it in future. The cumulative nature of normal items allows for potent builds focused on attacks and powers, or fun builds that just jump really, really, really high and make the platforming become easy (or even challenging for dumb-but-fun reasons).\n\nThe item unlock system doesn't feel grindy and does feel pretty progressive... until the end, when it may be prone to that because it may reach a situation where an item is very expensive but there may be multiple items remaining and you cannot spend the rest of your currency on it. It's also nice to see that an unlocked item will grant you use for your next run so you can test drive it, and that there's an unranked mode where you can test items by starting with a few.\n\nThe item unlock system and the item system go hand in hand where the unlocking currency can be spent instead to improve your chances with the next run by buying you items for that run.\n\nThe two characters add fun ways of playing. Nina's ranged tendencies versus Ace's melee tendencies allow for very different kinds of games to be played, and the combinations of them in two-player add lots of variation.\n\nOverall, I'd say it's a fun game and feels very polished for an early access game, doesn't seem like it will burn out, and will have a pretty strong launch, and I'm excited to see where it goes.", "timestamp_created": 1467817835, "timestamp_updated": 1467852169, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "24133943": {"recommendationid": "24133943", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077444123", "num_games_owned": 105, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 2249, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500766406}, "language": "english", "review": "this game is an amazing find after Not So Mighty No.9 was such a dissapointment!\nif i had to say something bad then id say that the art could use a bit of polish (particularly the main characters face is a bit amature) but thats nothing to worry about!\nif i had a suggetion it would be MORE CHARACTERS. i dont mind the main 2 but neither of them really appeals to me personaly. i think someone like Vile would be a nice change of pace. someone who is a bit slower with big a bigger single shot cannon rather than the dinky little lemon blaster. i can probably guess that you already have a weapon in the game like that, but to start a run with it would be very interesting.\nfailing that, it would be cool to unlock weapons in the game in such a way as to equip them before a run! perhaps only in casual mode though. im assuming (from what ive seen) none of them are more or less powerful than the other so i wouldnt be an unfair advantage to start with. more just a way to give players a bit more choice.\nreally though, any sugestion i give would come to that same point, choice is good. i believe that you have a tight and fun game here and all it needs is more content (weapons, items, areas, characters) and maybe something resembling a story mode?\n\nEDIT: OH AND A MAC RELEASE!!! i wanna be able to play with ALL my friends, even the stuborn ass who games on a mac.", "timestamp_created": 1467811522, "timestamp_updated": 1467811676, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "24125726": {"recommendationid": "24125726", "author": {"steamid": "76561197963775821", "num_games_owned": 149, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 9663, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491833271}, "language": "english", "review": "Thank you.

Something that procedurally generated levels could have very well killed, due to the random nature of such a system. However, I was pleasantly surprised, once I got this game. For - not only did it keep the fast-paced action platforming alive and well - but it actually improved upon the formula, by adding in a decent amount of exploration and randomly spawned power-ups that could be found!\n\nNow, this game wasn't as fleshed out as it is now-a-days, when I bought it - as I made sure to snag the game pretty early on in its life. A time when there were a few aspects that kept showing up in stages pretty repeatedly, giving away where secrets; traps; and enemy placements would be (though, the sprite-work was always amazing - and has only gotten better with time). However, even back when that was going on, I still found myself playing the game most every day, because of how addictingly fun the gameplay was! So, now that things have been DRASTICALLY upgraded - with new boss rooms; stage pieces; challenge rooms; and more - I find it harder to put down, than ever before. Constantly going through multiple runs, to see if I can find new secrets, or possibly even unlock a new power-up!\n\nThat said, while the game is mostly good, there are a few things that do need a little bit of work done to them. The main things being the online multiplayer and level biomes.\n\nWith the online functionality, I've often had a hard time connecting to a public lobby - and when I did, 4/10 times there would be a glitch that disconnects either of us. Which, is to be expected with early access versions of online multiplayer, but still something that's in need of \"a little\" tweaking. As it's almost to the point of being spot-on.\n\nAnother aspect - that would be nice for the multiplayer - is alternate skins/colors for the characters being played. I say this because I always play as Nina (the X counter-part), and find that most prefer to do the same. Making it somewhat confusing as to who's who, sometimes - when on the same screen. Which is why I suggest having a few new skins or colors for the players to choose from, when they pick a character. One of the ways this could be easily completed, would be by having the option to play as the different sprite versions of each character (ex: Choosing to play as modern Nina, or classic early access Nina). And, the developers could even add special functionalities to each - such as having the classic variations be naturally more powerful, but unable to use replacement/upgraded parts (ex: the torso replacement, that can cause you to heal when you bust an enemy). This would make it more of a challenge for those who play as the \"classic\" versions of the characters, but keep it fair at the same time.\n\nNow, as to what I was saying about the level biomes. The main issue here is that there seem to be only four different ones (or maybe I'm just unlucky and only ever get the four same ones?): Grass; Ice; Factory; & Sky. And, while these are really nice, they start to feel a bit repetitive after a while. So, adding in a couple more - such as a desert and city biome - would help make things feel a bit more varied. Though, this is more of a nit-pick than a problem.\n\nIn the end, I would HIGHLY recommend this game to anyone who likes the \"Megaman X\" style of action platforming. It keeps everything fast-paced, without feeling too streamlined. It's gameplay is addicting. And, it feels like this could have truly been a \"Megaman\" game, if the developer had contacted Capcom.\n\nMove over Keiji Inafune!

Precisamos de mais games assim no mercado , simples e precisos , sem querer ser tudo de uma vez , algo que possa ser bom no que \u00e9 e acredito que 20XX tem potencial para ser muito mais. \n\n[h1] Completamente recomendado!![/h1]\n\n[h1]English Review (Sorry for any mistakes):[/h1]\n\n[h1] The Game :[/h1]\n20XX is a platformer similar to Mega Man in many aspects but with a \"twist\".\nThis game mixes up \"Binding of Isaac\" mechanics and \"Bullethell\" games such as \"Metal Slug\" to create an Excelent Platformer for those who were looking for a solid , fun and fast paced game.\n\n20XX has a very strong replay value , because here the idea is to go as far as you can without dying , only by colecting items and buffs along the way.\nThere are a lot of different items , simillar to Binding of Isaac , you can find buffs , weapon modifiers and items that can change the way you play the game , but be carefull if you go through the \"super safe laboratory\" , because you can find items that are \"patent pending\" or \"still in test phase\" and might not be a good idea to get them.\n\nThere are just few bosses in the game(for now) , but they are fun to play against and the difficulty scales up with the level you are in. About the difficulty , this game challenges you in a fun way , without being unfair , and I LIKED IT A LOT. This game can be challenging sometimes , something that I miss a lot in the new games.\n\nThe soundtrack is very fun to listen to , it's chiptune wich fits perfectly with the style of the game.\nThe graphics are cartoon style like \"Castle Crashers\" and \" Binding of Isaac\" , they are not the BEST but gets the job done and that's it.\n\nThe gameplay shines in this game , because its very precise and very responsive. The developers are TEACHING how to make a good platformer here and This game Runs smoothly like butter , 60fps All the Way Baby!\n\nI Strongly reccomend a controller to play this game but you can play with the keyboard as well.\n\nThere's more! 20XX has a CO OP mode! It's still in alpha stages but it's functional and its a lot of fun with a friend playing together!\n\nThis game is a gem that's still being polished , and with the progress until now I must congratulate the Developers for such an awesome work! We need more games that are good in what they promise and do not try to do all at once and fails (or mediocre games...). \nI believe this game has the potential to be much more! But keep it simple guys! Good job!\n\n[h1]Strongly recommended!!

Keep in mind some things might have changed by the time you're reading this.\nThis is my longest indept review so far and I hope it helps out for those still deciding whether to get this game or not.\n\nTL;DR: Great game, fluent controls (as long as you have a controller), awesome music, replayability with enough challenge, constant development. Might take a while for a casual gamer to get into, needs some tweaking on class / power balance and has RNG (which you decide is either bad or not).\n\nPros\n\n- Awesome Music\n- Fluent Controls (controller recommended!)\n- Increase in player's skills\n- Lots of replayability\n- More then enough challenge, even for the hardcore gamer\n- Constant updates\n\nCons\n\n- Might take a while for a casual gamer to get far (a long run)\n- Classes and items need more balance\n- RNG (not per se a con)\n\nAwesome Music:\n\nClassic 8-bit music which fits right into the game. Different audio tracks have been created for certain areas and they all feel very natural to the environment. Might get a little repetitive for some, especially if your RNG and newbie skills make you do the same levels.\n\nFluent Controls:\n\nDespite the fact the controls might take a while to get used to, and that you need a controller in order to play properly, the end result is that it feels GREAT. Controls can be customized completely to the users will, which was the first step for me since the standard control layout didn't feel very natural to me (in case you want to know my controller layout, I am using xbox 360, let me know in the comment section of this review). Once used to the controls the second step is to know what to do at certain situations. For example, holding the dash button (vs not holding it) + a quick tap on the jump button vs a long tap on the jump button. This might be frustrating at first, when you come at that one point on the map, killing you with full health by making the same mistake over and over. But once you understand what to do, it just feels very fluent and natural.\n\nIncrease in player's skills:\n\nA lot of this has already been noted in the previous column, to add, that by time you get to learn how certain monsters behave, what kind of places to avoid, what powers / items to get, which maps to choose first and last (considering you're playing regular mode) and ofcourse, how the bosses work.\n\nLots of replayability:\n\nStarting off with the learning curves, also mentioned in the \"fluent controls\" and \"increase in player's skills\" column, which make you feel more like a badass the longer you play. Every time you finish a run you earned points during your last playthrough with which you can buy artifacts for the new run (artifacts give extra bonuses, like health, damage, pets), you can choose between a few cheaper ones which are already unlocked into the game versus a few more expensive ones to unlock them for the rest of your playthroughs (please keep in mind that due to early access this progress might be wiped eventually). Aside of this there is a daily and weekly challenge + hardcore mode, which I'll go explaining deeper into the next column.\n\nMore then enough challenge, even for the hardcore gamer:\n\nSo you won the normal mode, and unlocked most of the artifacts, what else is there to do? First off, the daily and weekly challenges. The daily challenge can be done once a day while the weekly can be done repeatedly until the weekly reset. \nSimply put, those challenges are the same for everyone, so the same infrastructure, same mobs, same loot.There is supposed to be leaderbords but I completed the weekly once and I didn't see any, so either my score was to low or this isn't implemented correctly yet. Next to this there is hardcore mode, which adds certain mods to your playthrough like; monsters having more hp or doing more damage, everything going faster and even things like no more artifacts and one single hit being instant death. Those are chosen by the game for the daily and weekly hardcore challenge (to clarify, those are seperate from the normal daily/weekly challenge) but can also be added when playing the regular mode, in which the player can choose which mods to add.\n\nConstant updates:\n\nI'll keep this one brief, since I don't own the game that long for myself. But there is a timer which counts down every 2 weeks for the next patch. And so far of what I'v read from the community and previous patch notes, the game is in constant development.\n\nMight take a while for a casual gamer to get far (a long run):\n\nDue to getting used to both controls and how to use them properly in the environment, combined with the learning curves all mentioned in the previous columns, this game might feel to hard for a casual gamer. Ending in the result that one might be stuck just doing the first few maps over and over. Although this is still randomized it takes away a lot of the fun factor, not being able to build up your character and getting stuck on tiny points in the map due to not knowing what to do. There is an option to add 3 artifacts before beginning a run but this doesn't prevent the points I just mentioned.\n\nClasses and items need more balance:\n\nThere are two classes, Nina and Ace, Nina shooting lightning bolts from a distance while ace uses a melee weapon. I currently find Nina way underpowered versus Ace, due to slower movement and more clumsiness when meeting face to face with a monster, Ace can rush through the maps a lot easier. There are different weapons to pick up during the game which might make Nina better suited + maybe mixing some powers but I haven't tested this to much, and even if this would be the case, it would mean you need to be lucky with the RNG. As for the powers (which are magic spells) I find a lot of them to be rather bad compared to others, for example, a blue square which moves very slowly from left to right (or right to left) while just hitting them normally seems easier. I currently just focus on one spell (a lightning shockwave) which disrupts a lot of enemy attacks, while otherwise only picking up artifacts. Which made me finish the game a couple of times by now (also while playing Ace). This is ofcourse early access, but definitely needs to be worked on. As for the artifacts itself, this has a lot to do with RNG, which is my next point.\n\nRNG:\n\nRandom Number Generator, it is what defines the present-day term of roguelike combined with permanent death. If you don't like to die and start over, or having randomized maps and different items each playthrough. Then I would suggest not to look any further into either this, or any other roguelike games. But if you don't mind this, or even like this a lot, like I do, then this game fits right in. Not all the items are equally good, but this is to be expected from a roguelike game, and I enjoy finding that awesome boots which make you fly for a brief second, or that penguin that accompanies you (yes I love Penguins!) to either come really far or lose it a few moments later due to some blunder you just made. So RNG, I mentioned it as a con since this aspect might not suit everyone, but to people like me, this is a pro.\n\nIt took me a while to make this detailed review, longer then I expected, below is a brief gameplay compilation I made.

It is inspired by the Megaman X series and it does everything right! Charge shots, dashing, wall jumps, wall slides, power ups and upgrades. It has the X and Zero type of play styles so you can shoot or use a sword! With a controller I can say it is spot on and plays just as solid as the famous Capcom game. \n\nThe graphics are also inspired by the X series and look very nice! Each area is detailed and all the sprites are animated well with small touches like light effects. It looks like a super high powered SNES game and this is a very good thing in my opinion. \n\nMusic is pretty good and is chiptune based. I will say unlike the rest of the game it sounds like it's more inspired by original Megaman games then the X series. Still the music is definitely not out of place and fits perfectly with the game and catchy. \n\nSo what makes this game different then just playing a Megaman X game? First I will start off that this game is a rouge like style platformer. Each time you play the game the levels are different! You have tons of power ups and most not available in the X games. Add this with the fact that it's multiplayer so you and a friend can take on levels together adds another layer of fun with the replayability. \n\nProviding daily and weekly challenges along with hardcore modes, if you are a Mega Man X fan or a platformer fan then you have no choice but to buy this game.", "timestamp_created": 1467475209, "timestamp_updated": 1467689679, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "24017127": {"recommendationid": "24017127", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025151422", "num_games_owned": 68, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 3196, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504739179}, "language": "english", "review": "Early Access, plays like Mega Man X, has random stages, very few non-obstructive bugs, multiplayer support and is still expanding.\n\nIf it is worth it?

I can respect that, but good intentions and discipline wouldn't amount to much if the resulting game was terrible. \n\nThankfully, 20XX is not. However, anyone going into the game should be aware from the outset that it is more than a \"clone\" of Megaman, and the resulting mechanical differences are decidedly not for everyone. \n\nThe game plays like so:\n[list]\n    [*] Two characters are available, Nina and Ace. They are the X and Zero analogues, respectively: Nina uses various forms of laser blast, while Ace uses various forms of glowy melee weaponry. Their playstyles differ rather substantially, with Nina being the \"safer\" choice and Ace being far more along the lines of \"high risk, high reward\".\n    [*]Regardless of chosen character, the core gameplay is the same: jump, dash, and shoot/slash through eight (later to be nine) semi-randomly generated levels on the way to an end boss, with the option to obtain that boss's power. If that sounds a lot like a Megaman game, it is, and yet it is not. The more specific you get into how 20XX plays, the more differences emerge.\n    [*]During play the player can find items that increase various stats, such as run speed, jump height, basic attack strength, and so on. These upgrades, as well as all others, only last for the run they are acquired on. \n    [*]Items can be unlocked to spawn in future runs using a special currency (\"soul chips\"), which are distinct from the currency used to buy items within a run (\"nuts\").\n    [*]You only have one life to tackle all the stages with. On death or victory, the player respawns in the starting hub with nothing but their default equipment and any soul chips they acquired. On starting a new run, any unspent soul chips vanish.\n\nWhether you will enjoy 20XX largely depends on your tolerance or acceptance of its rogue-like elements. The randomized features are effectively part of the game's core, as is the single life given to complete it. Those who desire a more traditional experience had best look elsewhere.\n\nAside from that subjective flaw, I only have a few real criticisms of 20XX:\n[list]\n    [*]The randomness inherent in anything with rogue-like elements at times overwhelms the game's platforming core, making the difficulty between runs rather variable. Improving in skill, of course, makes all runs easier... But that doesn't change that the RNG has a major influence.\n    [*]Although the game has relatively high replay value, it currently lacks the long-term goals of other games with rogue-like elements. After all items are unlocked (which, granted, I haven't done yet) there is currently little driving force in replays besides the core gameplay itself. For some, that will be enough. For others, robbed of a sense of progression, the game will stagnate.\n    [*]Although what is currently available is nice, greater variety in upgrades that do more than alter stats would always be welcome. \n    [*]Playing the game on a keyboard, at least with the default layout, is very far from ideal. The keys can be rebound, thankfully, and the developers provided a forum sticky for players to share their control configurations. Despite those measures, however, the game feels much less enjoyable without a gamepad. Your milage may vary. \n[/list]\n\nSo, do I recommend 20XX? In a general sense, yes. It's a solidly constructed platformer that does many things very well and is far more polished than its early-acess status would imply. That does not change, however, that those looking for a more traditional experience had best look elsewhere. 20XX is great at doing what it sets out to do.

ist die Megaman X Fortsetzung, die wir immer wollten, aber es weder wussten noch bekommen haben.\nDas Spiel ist schnell (streckenweise schnell genug, so dass man nach ausgiebigem am St\u00fcck gedaddel einen leicht verschoben Geisteszustand erreicht) und knackig schwer (ohne unn\u00f6tig zu frustrieren).\n\nDurch Verkn\u00fcpfung des alten Megamanprinzips mit Rouge-like Elementen spielt sich jeder Durchlauf und jedes Level jedesmal etwas anders, was die Dauermotivation enorm erh\u00f6ht. Au\u00dferdem bringt es damit frischen Wind in das Spiel ohne dass es fremd oder aufgesetzt wirkt.\n\nEs gibt 2 spielbare Charaktere. Die eine ist Nina (Megaman) und die zweite Figur ist Ace (Zero). Beide spielen sich sehr verschieden. Dennoch sind sie gut gegeneinander ausbalanciert und machen derbe Spa\u00df.\n\nDie Steuerung mit Xbox-Gamepads ist grundsolide und l\u00e4sst keine W\u00fcnsche offen. \nZur Tastatursteuerung kann ich nicht viel sagen, aber ich w\u00fcrde unbedingt empfehlen ein Gamepad zur Hand zu nehmen.\n\nDie Grafik ist recht h\u00fcbsch und die Anzahl von Effekten ist zweckm\u00e4\u00dfig. \n\nDer Soundtrack ist der absolute Wahnsinn und treibt einen energisch vorw\u00e4rts. Chiptune-Nostalgie vom Feinsten.\n\nEs gibt 3 Schwierigkeitsstufen, die von leicht bis H\u00f6lle reichen. Au\u00dferdem gibt es 4 verschiedene t\u00e4gliche und w\u00f6chentliche Leaderboardchallenges (je 2 glaube ich).\n\nZum Betastatus:\nAm Singleplayer gibts nix zu meckern. Es fehlt noch Content in Form von Leveln und Gegnern, aber was schon da ist, reicht dicke aus um einen zu besch\u00e4ftigen.\nDer Mehrspielermodus ist noch ziemlich buggy, so wurden 2 von 10 gespielten Koopdurchl\u00e4ufen durch Nicht-Spawnen des Kooppartners unspielbar und beendet. Auch die Syncronit\u00e4t des Multiplayers l\u00e4sst gerade bei beweglichen Plattformen noch zu w\u00fcnschen \u00fcbrig (meist fuhr mein Kooppartner ein Paar cm vor oder \u00fcber mir durch die Luft). Trotzdem macht es auch zu zweit jetzt schon viel Spa\u00df.\n\nDie Updates kommen im 2 Wochenrythmus und man wei\u00df jederzeit wie lange es bis zum n\u00e4chsten Update dauert, denn im Hauptmen\u00fc ist ein Counter eingeblendet.\n\nFazit:\nUnbedingte Kaufempfehlung f\u00fcr alle Fans der Megamanspiele. \nAber auch f\u00fcr alle anderen ist dieser Titel ein schneller und spa\u00dfiger Zeitvertreib der Extraklasse.", "timestamp_created": 1467236867, "timestamp_updated": 1467236867, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23933036": {"recommendationid": "23933036", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053382402", "num_games_owned": 41, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 149, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483016260}, "language": "english", "review": "I haven't play number 9, so wouldn't compare them.\n\nWith that being said\n\nGameplay : proper megaman clone, which is a good thing considering *ahem*, stuff.\n\nNow, there are several things that are really not megaman which MIGHT (sorry.) change in the future\n1.

I was mostly killed by the level, not the bosses.\n[*]I don't see the rock-paper-scissors mechanics as they do in Megaman, but maybe I didn't get far enough.\n[*]Destroying enemy robots feels really good. The explosions effects are better than the one in Mighty No 9.\n[*]Playing as Ace and Nina feels very different, adds variety to the game.\n[*]All graphics are great apart from the hero and bosses sprites.

I only have 10 hours as of this review. However, I will have far more before I'm through.\n\n[h1]The Good:[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Gameplay very similar to Mega Man X series, makes it easy to get into.\n[*]Music is solid and highly reminiscent of the genre.\n[*]Random level generation.\n[*]Multiplayer opportunity.\n[*]Daily and Weekly challenges.\n[*]Skulls (modifiers) to make your gameplay different (a random trio of these are automatically added to challenges).\n[*]Core Augments (body part upgrades) that impart set bonuses.\n[*]New weapons to acquire during playthrough.\n[*]Boss skills each do extra damage to a specific other boss.\n[*]Bosses get stronger as you do.\n[*]Levels get harder as you progress.\n[*]Character upgrades (extra HP, run speed, jump height, attack power, skill power, etc.) during runs.\n[*]Finding your corpse in the area of the level you last died in allows you to recover one upgrade from it.\n[*]Regular updates (including a timer on the main screen).\n[/list]\n\n[h1]The Not So Good:[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Repetitive Levels (only four themes for the eight bosses).\n[*]No story (no reason for the battles, no main boss).\n[*]Enemies don't respawn (I can see the point of this one, because then you could farm nuts, but you can't farm health or energy like in a standard Mega Man game)\n[*]No 'Lives' before reset, which is a killer on \"Rock\" mode (a skull) which makes pits and spikes lethal.\n[*]Can only learn 3 boss abilities, and you may not be able to learn a weakness for any available bosses at level end. (would recommend letting you select the 3 active abilities, but learn all eight)\n[*]Only two characters. (I know, \"really bruh?\"  See below.)\n[/list]\n\nWhy gripe about characters?  It's not a biggie, honestly.  However, [i]always[/i] playing blue Nina or red Ace, always N-Buster or A-Saber as weapons, when you can play multiplayer, is so disengaging in modern gaming.  So many games allow you to customize your color scheme at the least, if not different body parts and weapons/skills entirely like in DBZ Xenoverse.  If I could see some more unique character development options, this game would be a solid 10/10 for me.  Gameplay will always be Mega Man X Clone, so the real way to step out of the mould is with character development.\n\nThat's not to say the devs haven't done that already.  With the shops and upgrades similar to Risk of Rain, the skulls, the 5 weapons per character, and the core augments that change your appearance (without having to go to X location in Y stage to get Z core augment) they are already a step above MMX.  I can picture multiple ways some more customization could be added in without changing Nina or Ace, or a couple ways (like palette choices) to affect them for the user's preference.  Anyone else remember playing as Black Zero?  Or when Mega Man's colors changed based on the boss power equipped?\n\nThis game is solid.

Somehow, it works.\n\nThis is a game inspired QUITE heavily by the Mega Man X series to the point where veterans will be able to master the game's controls within seconds.  A multitude of game mechanics return directly, such as charging shots, dashing (and dash jumping), wall jumping up individual walls, boss weapons, and many of the upgrades from the original games.\n\nHowever, 20XX does display some discipline when taking elements, removing or modifying gimmicks that induce frustration (such as blunting spikes and bottomless pits to a single point of damage as punishment) and adding several common roguelike mechanics.\n\nBy action-roguelike standards, 20XX does pull its punches, and the success of a run is not as reliant on RNG as its compatriots.  It does suffer from the common action-roguelike problem of creating difficulty through bullet hell-type enemy attack patterns, but in a normal run, bullet density will never become outright ludicrous (as it does in Rogue Legacy) and there is still some emphasis on reacting to attack patterns rather than painstakingly threading the protagonist through holes in a sea of projectiles.\n\nThe character progression in an individual run is excellent.  In addition to raw damage/health/energy numbers increasing, items can be collected to increase jump height/movement speed, add special aerial maneuevers, and drastically change the behavior of standard attacks.  Progression is significant enough that starting a new run after getting fairly far can be quite jarring, as one gradually becomes accustomed to the increased agility and utility one gains as one moves farther into a run.\n\nAs of this review, the game is still in early-access, and there are some small flaws and glitches to be encountered.

It is for people that like Megaman X/Megaman type games obviously... but this game is a little too insane for my tastes. the hit sprites for the enemies and attacks are so huge, that hit detection isn't quite perfect. There were plenty of times I was trying to avoid a big fireball or enemy, and then I jumped forward - and thought I would take damage, but didn't because the hitbox of everything isn't the entire sprite. You eventually get a feel for it and can compensate, but I really think that if you visually touch a sprite border, you should take damage.\n\nAlso, I think because of the nature of the random levels, it relies too much on cheap hits from huge groups of weak enemies and environment hazards. I much prefer more thought out levels created by real people - like the Megaman games. It just feels more fluid and challenging on a fair level, as opposed to a bunch of thrown together hazards. I feel like they need to tweak the level generation process to allow for some more cohesive levelsthat don't have pit drops and environment hazards constantly. \n\nAll that being said, I don't hate it - and I can enjoy it to a small degree. My biggest complaint is there is no real feeling of progression overall. I think it would do well to add something like usable energy tanks, and maybe a few items that hold over even after dying (if even only for a few runs after instead of forever.) So far it's super frustrating to be having an excellent run, then getting screwed by a bad level or a crazy difficult boss, then to start literally over from the beginning with no nuts, and your base abilities.\n\nAlso, the few music tracks are pretty good - but they need a LOT more. They get repetitive much quicker than Megaman music does for sure.\n\nLastly, I feel like the main characters still need a slight redesign. They look kind of cheap to me. Something is missing, but I can't quite put my finger on it.\n\nI'm glad it's still early access, which means they can hopefully polish some of this into a more enjoyable game. As it is, I find myself screaming after every death and have to turn it off for a few hours before I feel like subjecting myself to it again.\n\nI recommend it to anyone wanting a good Megaman type shooter, at the $8.99 price I got it at.

I try my best to judge a game by the technical and core aspects, but even with my review I still believe these games are not for everyone.\n\nThe one genre I never had much skill for would have to be the side-scrolling platformer. There are a variety of famous games that have immortalized the genre and each one has left me dead in he corner. I should probably be the last person reviewing this type of game, but when I noticed 20XX was on sale and that \"Inafundme\" had his game coming out next week, I thought it would be nice to see what a small group can do to recapture the feel of the genre. As I expected, I was not very good at it, but that doesn't mean the game is bad - just me. \n\nIt is a good thing to note that a controller would probably save you some major heartache. When I switched over from keyboard, my survivability skyrocketed, problem due to the keyboard button layout. You start off with a tutorial that introduces the key button responses and fight one of the beginner bosses. It is quick, informative and leads you to the main hub where you can purchase items, switch characters, attempt challenges and jump into the main game. Daily challenges are up for grabs and the items for sale can be purchased with soul nuggets you acquire during missions. Two unique play styles are offered as Nina (blue armor) utilizes a blaster that only shoots left or right (without upgrades) and Ace (red armor) wielding a sabre. A collection of all the items you obtained is also present, which helps keep track of the beneficial qualities each item brings to the table.\n\nSimilar to the old school style games 20XX seeks to emulate, the visual appeal has a very retro aesthetic in level design. Character models and enemy textures look a little more three dimensional, but they complement the scenery quite well with bright color helping detail projectiles. Music is top notch with upbeat tempos helping keep the tension high as the clock in the top left counts down. Blaster shots and sword swings carry that classic \"pew pew\" noise you expect from these kinds of games with explosions and fire bursts rounding out a simple, but effective sound design. It is what one would expect from a Mega-man game and it really lives up to that expectation well. \n\nBlasting enemies and collecting power ups is the primary objective in overcoming the challenges this game has to offer. Each level has a platform run filled with potential upgrades, such as stat boosters and main weapon changes, that help deal with the boss fights found at the end. Once the boss is defeated, you are given a reward and able to select from one of three portals leading to the next level. The further you manage to go the more difficult enemies and level layouts become. Added challenges are also available in the form of skulls that make each level harder, from denying health drops to selecting the next level you proceed to after the boss. It can be as hard or as easy as you want in 20XX, which makes it very accessible to hardcore veterans or new inductees alike.\n\nUnlike other Mega-man esq games, 20XX manages to fuse rogue-like elements into the mix and pulls it off rather effectively. During each run, blue versions of typical enemies will appear and have the chance to drop soul nuts, which you use upon death to purchase items from the main base. This provides a small leg up and if the soul nuts are not used, then they are lost forever. The randomization of level layouts have been consistently different throughout my entire play through with only one or two levels feeling familiar in parts. There are also infrequent portals to challenge rooms that can appear along with vending machines used to replenish health and energy for bolts. Luck can be a deciding factor in terms of running into off setting platform formations that will unfortunately lead you to be stuck in an inescapable position. Other than that, the rogue like elements really keep the game fresh and challenging to what could have easily been just a eight boss campaign. \n\nCo-op is present in the game over online service or locally, but I only jumped in once to ensure it was functioning. It worked rather well, but things can get a bit chaotic on screen with all the enemies. Challenges for weekly and daily variations have a set restriction mode and a standard version to give an extra difficulty setting, but they generally play like a normal run. There are some issues, however, that creep up from time to time. Hit box detection for some enemies is extremely picky and can have you easily killing a something normally while the same monster requires you to be on it completely just to hit it. Enemy types are rather limited with a standard color change used as a resin for tougher foes. Some of the background images can be misleading when placed behind platforms, making it difficult to tell if a slice of land is actually there or not. Levels are relatively short, but this can be a pro or a negative depending on your approach. I had an issue with some of the randomized platform jumps, but those were very far and few between. The one aspect of the game I can happily support is how well it runs at this point in time. It can still use some optimization, but this has to be one of the best frame rates I have seen with a early access title. \n\nI do not regret purchasing 20XX and have a good feeling it will surpass the expectations of eager platform enthusiasts still hoping Might #9 will have a shred of playability. It can eat away a good chunk of time and keeps things fresh with the randomized levels. It is one of the few games I have experienced during my harsh journey into Early Access that manages to remain operational. It has a bug here and there, but overall 20XX pulls off a stellar charged shot into a genre held hostage by nostalgia. I look forward to seeing how the game manages to evolve further down the line.\n\nPros\n\n- It looks like a retro and sounds like a retro\n- Plenty of options to adjust difficulty\n- Randomized levels and boss fights are challenging and enjoyable\n- Runs rather well at this point\n\nCons\n\n- Luck has some influence in level design and can destroy a great run\n- Levels are somewhat short", "timestamp_created": 1465605228, "timestamp_updated": 1465605269, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.445582", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23489784": {"recommendationid": "23489784", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118829087", "num_games_owned": 66, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1682, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503224421}, "language": "english", "review": "An absolute must have for any Mega Man X or Mega Man Zero fan.

I bought the game, I installed it, and I immediately dove head-first into the world with a feeling of nostalgia backing a fresher and more modern take on the genre... but you know what they say about that: \"[i]Go in with high expectations, and you'll only walk out disappointed.[/i]\"\n\nI gave both protagonists and a majority of the eight bosses in the game a fair and honest shot before coming to this conclusion. After an hour in the game, I asked myself, \"Alright, where's the classic mode that lets me fight enemies and bosses in any order I see fit?\" And despite all of the amazing modes that I could choose from\u2014daily and weekly challenges, hardcore challenges with game-changing augments, a normal mode for that nostalgic jump-'n'-shoot platformer feel, and a casual mode which allows you to start the game with any three bonuses you've collected or purchased in the past\u2014I could not find the thing I wanted most out of the entire game: a simple choose-your-own adventure style of game where I could pick it up and progress at my leisure... in-game, my only options are pick it up and play through to the bitter end in one fell swoop, or die trying and lose absolutely all progress made in that attempt with no option to continue right off the bat.\n\nIn a similar style as games like Rogue Legacy and even some Castlevania titles, enemies come in three different flavors, typically a base form and some differently colored yet more powerful versions found in later levels. Not only is this something of a cheap attempt at padding the game out to make it seem like there's plenty of enemy diversity, some of them are just downright bull to fight like a ballista-type enemies that fires rapidly in varying arcs in one form while the next form has it firing slightly slower but triples the number of projectiles per shot. The bosses in this game can either be some of the easiest things in the world or a complete nightmare to fight... I think the one I hated least was \"Perforator Alpha\" who, so long as you're against the wall behind him, will never be able to hit you ever; likewise, there are bosses in this game that can be just a pain to fight like \"Rollster\" who has an enormous hitbox himself but has attacks that can be downright impossible to dodge, or \"Death Lotus\" who can only be damaged after making a long vertical trek up a long shaft with slippery disappearing platforms from top to bottom which can be incredibly imprecise when you can randomly pick up abilities that change your speed and jump height on a whim.\n\nI think the largest problem I have with the game is the characters' weapon selection itself; Nina and Ace's default weapons are objectively the best among them and anything else is a considerable downgrade for the most part. While on the topic of bosses, some of the weapons you earn are just completely ineffectual\u2014Perforator's boss weapon is pretty good against anything that isn't a boss, but it chews through ammo too quickly to be of any use; Rollster's weapon has great utility, but horrible range; Vile Spider's weapon is little more than a 'get-out-of-jail-free' card when surrounded by an undodgeable bullet hell... and that's really all I can remember off the top of my head. On the topic of the characters' own weapons, I did mention that their basic weapons were objectively better than anything else, and I hold to that statement. For Nina, one of the weapons I got allowed me to fire in four different directions simultaneously but absolutely neutered my frequently-used charge attack, and an attack that let me fire off shots in a wave which wasn't all too powerful; for Ace, however, my two weapons were a spear that extended and retracted horizontally after a short delay, and something called the Blender that, in theory, is incredibly cool\u2014if you've played a Castlevania game, you might know it as the 'Crissaegrim' or 'Valmanway'... but there's only one word for it in this game, and it's 'garbage'. And because I had to go through a nigh-impossible onslaught of pre-placed stage hazards to get to it, I had to advance another minute or so into the level before I even got to test it, at which point it's too late to try and backtrack to undo your mistake. The range is incredibly poor when you're initially attacking and the upper and lower bound of the hitbox are too short for what appears on screen (I almost had to be inside of my enemies to damage them); only after killing consecutive enemies does the attack get larger and more substantial, but it fades almost immediately, making the meager benefit entirely worthless.\n\nI wanted to come into this game liking it. The bosses have interesting designs, the procedurally-generated levels are fun up to a certain point and the protagonists have a distinct charm about them, especially Nina, a strong female protagonist where good woman leads are still few and far between... but with each subsequent playthrough, I found that getting increasingly hard to do, especially since I made a risk to try an early-access game well before any proposed completion date. I've already demanded a refund through Steam, but I will be watching the game's progress from the distant sidelines; if I feel at any point that I was wrong about this game, I will funnel my money back into it and give your product an honest second shot. At this point, however...

It even controls pretty much exactly like MMX, except your boss weapons are mapped to their own buttons instead of being able to change to them.\n\nGraphically the game is in 2D and uses sprites, but it looks kinda like a flash game. The music however is pretty cool. It's all chiptune music and sounds great.\n\nYou've also got access to two different characters (Nina and Ace) which play very similarly to X and Zero.  Nina uses a chargeable Arm Cannon but only fires straight, and Ace uses a beam saber.\n\nBeing a Rogue-Like game, there's a lot of Replay value to be had. Each level is generated from scratch to be different. Every run is littered with different powerups that augment one or a combination of abilities. Aside from boss abilities there are powerups that change the function of your main weapons too (like a triple shot for Nina). There are also skulls you can activate that make the game harder too much like Halo's skulls or Gears of War's Mutations\n\nPerhaps the best thing about this game IMO is the Co-op.

What I mean by this is, when playing megaman, you can continue from the start of the stage (With all your powerups and buffs) but in this game, I only found myself constantly restarting without any such powerups or buffs. \n\nIt's a bit dissapointing because I - personally - don't like to 'start from 0' every time, and neither did my friend. What this meant was, as we're probably not the most skilled players in the world, we found the barrier to entry was much higher for us. \n\nGameplay wise, it felt pretty tight and smooth on my end - but the methods for dash jumping felt a bit iffy. Friend found that things felt very 'Floaty' compared to a MegaMan game. So various feelings are floating around on it. \n\nThe level design, however... I really hated the level design. A huge thing with MegaMan games - which is what drew us here, advertising it as a 'game with megaman like gameplay' - is that your levels need to have an intelligent design to them. But there was a number of times where we found ourselves in a spot where there'd be -no- way to dodge. No way to evade. No way out. \n\nThere was nothing as upsetting as slowly progressing with 1 hit left, knowing that making a mistake would kill me. Only to see a sure-fire death trap up ahead. A laser barrier behind that I had to jump through, a wall that I had to climb up via walljumps right opposite of it, and a Cannon right at the top of it. No way to get up there and hit the canon without eating a hit.\n\nAfter an hour of playing, we found we DID enjoy the game...

The level elements are randomly generated, giving a new experience each time you play. Collecting augmenting items, aquiring armor, and obtaining bosses weapons all enhance your robotic warrior as you blast your way through the game.\n\nPros: \nGameplay: The game feels very similar to Capcom's iconic JUMPANDSHOOTMAN franchise. While the physics are not completely identical, it's accessable enough for veteran players to jump into the action.\nItems: The variety of collectables breath life into the genre, changing the game in fun and exciting ways.\nMusic: The score is top notch. \nDifficulty: The game starts off very friendly for beginning players, but scales up in difficulty after progressing through each stage, reaching brutally punishing levels late game, just like Mega Man games are known for.\nSupport: The developers are constantly updating the game (and do so every other Wednesday), adding new content and responding to user feedback. It's refreshing to see how involved the creators are.\n\nCons:\nRandomly Spawning Items: This game is a roguelike, so random powerups come with the territory. But it can be very frustrating when you cannot find powerups that are relevent to your current character build.\nDIfficulty: As I mentioned, this game can be downright punishing. Especially if you don't have the proper items and equipment, some of the late game stage hazards seem cheap and infuriating. The laser traps in the Sky Temple in particular will make you want to throw your controller if you couldn't find anything to help you deal with them.\nLearning Curve: This isn't a con so much as a statement, but there is a definite adjustment period needed to get use to the game mechanics; especially if you're a Mega Man veteran. For example, the fact that your health doesn't replenish at the start of each new level seemed very strange at first, but once you get a feel for the game, these adjustments become a nonissue.\n\nAll things considered, I love this game, and am continuously impressed by how far its come.

What more, the randomly generated levels prevent you from getting too \"muscle memory\" with the jumps. While the levels are still primarily linear, they do have you going left, right, up, and down.

It really just likes to throw a bunch of enemies at you and pretend it's hard, when a charge shot wipes out everything in a line anyways. The platforming is basic, and relies heavily on poorly timed hazards like lazers that always turn on at the time you actually need to jump.\n-Disappearing block platforming, constantly. If you didn't like those parts in megaman, you'll hate them here. They're strewn throughout the levels like a weed on fertilizer.\n-The random generation really feels like the same thing over and over. Most of the items are basic \"more damage, more drops, higher jump, max health, max energy\", with a few interesting things mixed in.\n-I repeat my earlier point on hating the level design. Perhaps randomly generated platforming is only good on paper, especially when that naturally means a lot of repeated platforming sections.\n-Don't really like how the character controls.

What more could you want?\n\nAlright alright, I'll give you some useful info too. Things to note:\n\n[h1]Differences from MMX:[/h1]\n[list]\n[*] [b]Less emphasis on charge shots.[/b] A fully charged attack takes like 2-3 seconds and does the damage of two shots. However, like MMX, they do penetrate through large numbers of small enemies. Ironically, it doesn't make that annoying noise. Or any noise at all.\n[*] [b]You don't switch weapons the traditional way.[/b] You have extra buttons assigned to 3 different ones which you simply press to use. Pretty essential actually, since the alternate weapons are actually more useful in general, and energy for them is way more plentiful. Admittedly, it'd be nice if you could just have a button for one and use the shoulder triggers to switch, because something something Xbox 360 controller. Yes, there is still a boss weakness system, and each boss drops its own unique weapon every time, but interestingly you can choose to forgo it in exchange for extra \"nuts\" (in-game roguelike currency) or a random upgrade.\n[*] [b]There are physic adjustments as upgrades.[/b] One really rare one I found gave a jetpack allowing short flight every jump, but most of them involve jump height or movement speed. There is no midair dash by default and I don't know if it exists as an upgrade.\n[*] [b]There are some \"buster swap\" upgrades.[/b] Like, not as an alternate weapon, you literally trade your main shot. Usually more directions fired in for slightly less damage per bullet.\n[*] [b]Default limit is 3 bullets on the screen at once, like classic Mega Man.[/b] There is at least one upgrade that increases this, and massively I might add (8 at once).\n[*] [b]Killed enemies do not respawn, but their drops do not despawn.[/b] For the most part, enemies only drop your traditional MM pickups: health, energy, and the game's currency (think MM9's bolts). Even if they fall into lava or spikes, they stay there. However, they are gone forever if they fall into a bottomless pit. Speaking of which...\n[*] [b]Spikes, lava, and bottomless pits are not instant death. The game is still hard regardless.[/b] In the case of lava and pits, you are teleported back to the last non-moving, permanent platform you stood on. Vanishing platforms do respawn after about 5 seconds or so. Also, this game has those vanishing blocks. You know, like Heatman. Whoooooooooooop. Except they don't make that godawful noise.\n[*] [b]You know those super secret areas where you could find cool gear? They exist in this game.[/b] Sort of. The gear itself is not found there, but comes as part of different \"sets\" with specific qualities and are equipped like RPG armor, as very rare random drops. The analogous secret areas, however, let you meet a very demonic version of the game's wannabe Dr. Light character. These areas give you the chance to pick up an upgrade that gives an enormous boost in power while giving an enormous disdvantage. Also, the upgrade's description is listed in very cryptic, sinister terms, so you usually have to figure out exactly what it does the hard way.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Roguelike quirks:[/h1]\n[list]\n[*] [b]There is inter-run progression.[/b] However, as someone who usually hates that, it's handled really elegantly here (as opposed to an obviously grindy fashion). You gain a meta-currency called \"soul nuts\" (with the in-run currency being called \"nuts\") after every run, but [i]soul nuts are lost if you do not spend them before the next run.[/i] Also, you can't choose from the whole selection items; the hub world shop only has 3 random items (out of those you haven't unlocked yet), and buying one unlocks it as a random drop in future run while granting it to you for free for the next run only. Thus, if you do poorly on a run, but an expensive item you want shows up, you're sadly not gonna get it, because you're gonna lose your nuts (heh) regardless, and there's a good chance it's not gonna be in the 3-item lineup after next run. If everything is too expensive, or you have a little left over, there's another hub world shop which sells basic upgrades and cheaper, already-unlocked stuff to help make your next run easier as a compensation prize. Kind of a cool way to do that, even if it means that runs aren't fully independent.\n[*] [b]There are dailies and weeklies, and more importantly the inter-run progression system does not apply to them at all.[/b] If you wanna go full purist, do this. As expected, you get one chance at each daily, but it switches at around midnight US time. You can play weeklies unlimited times, but it's one specific run. That is, it's generated at the start of the week and not randomized.\n[*] [b]There are hardcore modes.[/b] In-game, they're called \"skulls\". They let you make your runs harder for no benefit. There are also hardcore dailies and weeklies, but those use specific (and pretty ordinary) combinations of skulls and are not tied to the non-hardcore versions of the same. That is, it's not just \"the normal daily run with hard stuff\", it's a separate daily.\n[*] [b]Level generation-wise, this game is very similar to Binding of Isaac.[/b] Levels are mostly modular. with a number of hand-made level pieces that are randomly, but somewhat intelligently (most of the time) strung together. Levels also fall into one of a handful specific \"themes\". This is not merely for aesthetics, each theme has its own distinct set of level patterns, i.e. there are no \"universal\" patterns from what I can tell. Crucially, this means that you don't get \"samey\" level design between themes, although admittedly you do get it within any specific theme. However, I attribute that more to the game still being a bit premature in development, I would probably bet money that the patterns will become a little more diverse as the game is developed and balanced. As it stands, I'm actually impressed at how much the different themes stand out from each other gameplay-wise for being dynamically generated. Including how the \"sky temple\" theme manages to get the art of making aggressively annoying precision platforming stages down to a T every time. Joking aside, it's actually pretty damn good considering that it's generating platformer levels, but there's definitely some room for improvement.\n[*] [b]RNG is relatively friendly in this game.[/b] Most of the upgrades are completely modular, like BoI. There are \"armor slot\" upgrades, the most prominent of which are Mega Man-style weapons. Each boss always gives the same, specific weapon, and you can even choose to forgo it for money or an upgrade if you don't like their weapon. Numbers are a really minor factor in this game compared to other roguelikes, with the most sigificant ones being defense- or mobility-related. Very few of the items have a downside at all, and those that do are [i]extremely[/i] minor in that regard, to the point where the item is still definitely an upgrade. Biggest exception being the \"Demon Dr. Light\" items, which are intentionally designed to have an enormous downside. Even then, half of these still manage to be way less brutal than equivalent upgrades in Binding of Isaac. They're more akin to Nuclear Throne's cursed weapons in terms of downside, minus the whole issue where you can run out of means to do damage at all... which is a big one, but I digress. Level generation RNG plays a way bigger factor than any other form of it, with the second contender being HP and energy drops, namely whether you get it or not after the rare event where you get dicked over by the level generator.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Closing notes[/h1]\n\nMost issues I have involve bugs or the occasional level generation issue. Namely, disproportionately difficult patterns (or almost-impossible patterns, even) showing up out of nowhere in an early-game level. Stuff that i imagine will be ironed out as Early Access progresses. Time will tell!

Also the platforming and controls are so smooth and actually play just as good, if not better, than a certain platformer series that this game may or may not be based off of COUGH Mega Man X COUGH. \n\nThe items and armor upgrades are all cool and unique, and it feels so rewarding when you earn them, whether it's through completing battle challenges, or platforming challenges. 20XX is also a roguelike, meaning it changes every time you play, and you get to choose which boss to take on next. New weapons also give new fun ways to use the character, allowing you to develop your own strategies to clear enemies and finish the stage. This game honestly has me more hyped than Mighty No. 9 ever could get me, and the soundtrack for this game is absolutely beautiful, and just SCREAMS Mega Man X. I actually need to listen to the full title theme before I start the game and exit the game. All the time.\n\nAnother feature that adds even more replayability are the leaderboards and daily/weekly challenges, which are premade 20XX runs, and they're solid, clean fun. The game also has a casual mode which increases accessibility to people who aren't hardcore platformer players, and lets everyone have a good time. Also, did I mention you can bring a friend and you can both have a grand old time?\n\nThis game nails everything down hard.

Drawing closely from Megaman and adding in a roguelike element is a cool idea and works well. These guys are definitely on the right track to making a really good game. The multiplayer is surprisingly refined for being so early into beta and offers an impressively synchronized experience. I think it offers a fair amount of difficulty, though I'm thankful that they have a 'challenge' mode system in there akin to Bastion's pantheon/god idol system. Item system feels pretty standard in terms of roguelike item sets, though a few key differences like the swappable armor system and 'prototypes' (upgrades that offer a great plus side but come with a risky detriment) change things up a bit.\n\nYou get a player choice between 'Not-Megaman' and 'Not-Zero' (aka Nina and Ace). If you like shooting, you go Nina. If you like Zero's badass sword attacks, you go Ace. He plays a lot like the newer Megaman Zero games, minus the gun. I typically play as Ace because he starts off with a nice damage bonus, but I've been finding that Nina has more survivability and usually ends up being stronger than Ace later on.\n\nThe music is pretty awesome so far. It reminds me of the newer Megaman games in a way and is very fitting to the environments.\n\nThe Eh Stuff:\nI can't criticize the game too heavily as it's not really done yet, but going from my perspective today, I think the devs have some work to do yet. While the randomly generated level system is a pretty cool approach to a Megaman game, I think the current generation has a great deal of improvements yet to make before I'd consider it complete. They recently overhauled one of the stage generators... and I must admit, that's more along the lines of what I was hoping to see here. While the current beta design for most of the levels is lacking, it's obvious that the devs know about this already and are working to improve it as I type.\n\nAgain, another beta criticism, but the number of level types at current is lacking. You currently go to three different areas for the 8 different bosses... after a while, you've memorized all of the possible level layouts and know how to straight up skip stuff and when to do so. Doesn't really weigh this down that much, though, as they're consistently releasing updates for the game. I'm sure more level types and bosses are going to come into the mix as development continues.\n\nThat's pretty much all the negatives I can think of... and they're not really even negatives, considering they'll be improved over the course of development. \n\nOverall:\nI'd definitely recommend 20XX to anybody that enjoys platformers or roguelikes.

I read most of the reviews, and decided to grab it for me and my wife to play. Lets take a look.\n\nPROS:\n\n- Great idea. Not many other Mega Man style games out there. I feel like it could potentially be a good game. I like the idea of the rogue-style.\n\n- Very reminscent of Mega Man games, down to the character models and enemies.\n\n- Randomization of levels can be interesting. I can see there being replay value here.\n\n\nCONS:\n\n- Boring after about fifteen minutes. You just start to lose interest because of a few reasons I'll list below.\n\n- Very poor co-op. It's just honestly not very fun. Most of the time you're in each other's way, and the other person feels like a tag-along. It's like both people are playing a single player game, and there isn't any interaction. It's more frustrating than anything else.\n\n- Awful bosses. This game makes you work towards bosses that aren't really unique or very fun to even fight. Most of them are defeated easily. You're given their powers, but once you die you lose it all. It really loses the strategy behind Mega Man boss fights, where you fight one boss to get his power that will help you defeat another. You're working towards the \"boss\" every level, but most of the time the bosses are just regular enemy models that have different colors. \n\n- Randomization in levels. Seems like such a cool idea, until you realize that the levels get frustrating at times and you're just grinding to get to the end. The levels lose their charm quickly because of the randomness, which kind of kills any feeling of a story. There's no stopping and going back to base, customization of your gear or bonuses or character, or really anything. You lose all of your progress when you die, and it sucks to load up the game and start from scratch simply because you really don't feel any kind of satisfaction by getting far. You don't really work towards anything.\n\n\nVERDICT:\n\nOverall, I feel like this game needs some more story structure in order to give us a direction. I found myself disliking the game fairly quickly, which isn't something that happens to me often. I wasn't expecting Mega Man here, but they gave the game such a Mega Man look and feel that I can't help but compare it. I would suggest they add a Story mode that allows you to hit checkpoints after killing bosses. Make the bosses more difficult and the levels more varied. Powerups are disappointing and the nut system is exciting until you realize you don't really care about anything that you can buy.\n\nStructure is important, because this game is a little confusing in the beginning. I feel like a short tutorial level, which is prevelant in some of the Mega Man games, would be useful here. The first few bosses that I fought were disappointing because I didn't realize they were actually bosses.\n\nI can't recommend this game in the current state. It's playable, but not very fun. If you're looking for some classic Mega Man gameplay, go get an emulator and play Mega Man.", "timestamp_created": 1456445511, "timestamp_updated": 1456445511, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.485583", "comment_count": "6", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "21449420": {"recommendationid": "21449420", "author": {"steamid": "76561197977081885", "num_games_owned": 524, "num_reviews": 368, "playtime_forever": 71, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1442976229}, "language": "english", "review": "Dang ol megaman roguelike upins here.", "timestamp_created": 1456427288, "timestamp_updated": 1456427288, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "21399212": {"recommendationid": "21399212", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042035923", "num_games_owned": 3425, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 173, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503306483}, "language": "english", "review": "Plays like MegaMan X, controls are tight, has roguelike elements, I know I'm not saying anything that hasn't already been said but it's truly worth picking up.", "timestamp_created": 1456202319, "timestamp_updated": 1456202319, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.479801", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "21385582": {"recommendationid": "21385582", "author": {"steamid": "76561198148759766", "num_games_owned": 205, "num_reviews": 65, "playtime_forever": 170, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1457663247}, "language": "english", "review": "In the year 20XX everyone is a robot and you must fight to survive in a post apocalyptic world", "timestamp_created": 1456147459, "timestamp_updated": 1456147459, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497288", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "21376061": {"recommendationid": "21376061", "author": {"steamid": "76561198215520180", "num_games_owned": 41, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1299, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 313, "last_played": 1513710008}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Apenas a uma coisa q supera Megaman esse jogo \u00e9 um jogo maravilhoso mais pq  gente s\u00f3 tem uma VIDA !??!??!", "timestamp_created": 1456097638, "timestamp_updated": 1456097638, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "21356074": {"recommendationid": "21356074", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077708551", "num_games_owned": 578, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1658, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512458975}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is the bee's knees.", "timestamp_created": 1456029979, "timestamp_updated": 1456029979, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "21351883": {"recommendationid": "21351883", "author": {"steamid": "76561197962752145", "num_games_owned": 57, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 154, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1444550137}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a great idea for a rogue-like but, it will not rekindle your passion for Mega Man. It doesn't have Capcom behind it and thus, the graphics, mechanics, gameplay, level design, boss design, etc. are not going to be the same as a game put out by them. I'm not saying this is a bad game and you shouldn't get it if you love the frustration of rogue-likes and the Newgrounds Flash-game-esque bastardization of a childhood memory coupled into one package; just that it's not going to be what you might expect when you think \"Mega Man\". To speak to the generation of the levels; at least when I played the game, even on the easiest setting, there are some combinations of stage \"blocks\" (or whatever you want to call them) that led to some ridiculous scenarios. I understand that that is what makes this game but, if you're going to have the idea of \"completion\" of a run in the game at least make it viable that every run can potentially be completed. With the design I saw you have about a 50% chance of getting stuck with somthing outright undoable - especially by a team. One more thing I can speak on is team play. It sucks. There's so much going on in some stages of the game and the graphical design does not take this into account to the point where my duo partner and I would complete the levels almost individually to reduce the risk of death.

This game is hard. This game tests your abilities. This game will make you scream at it at some points... and I LOVE IT for this. This game is a reminder of the older years of gaming.\n\nThe platforming is difficult, especially in the later parts of a run, but it is still fair. It may look impossible at some points, but once you see how the platforms move or how the patterns work, it is doable. This can best be seen in the sky stages: a massive amount of obstacles are thrown your way, but there is still a pattern that can be traveled to traverse the stage. However, some of the real challenges come from the in-game difficulty modifications. Adding the in-game difficulty with mods affecting the length of the stage, the health of the enemies, or even your own attack power (or for the truly insane, all 3 plus instant death against falls and spikes), will truly test your abilities against titles such as this.\n\nOr, for a truly nostagiac feeling, just add the spikes and falls hazard mod for a more retro feel. Just... don't look for 1-ups....\n\nThe controls are solid, and very responsive. The immediate response to button imputs, whether with a controller or with a keyboard, allow for quick reactions to whatever is thrown your way. The layout for the controls are simple and easy to learn, allowing a number of players to easily pick up a controller or keyboard and play the game.\n\nOne of the best parts of the game is the inclusion of two different playable characters for a run. Ace and Nina offer two different playstyles within the same environment. These two styles allow players to not only pick their own approach to a level, but to also learn how to approach enemies, find different strategies to approach them, and learn to traverse the stages around them, if necessary, in order reach the boss. The two playstyles have you think about what the character can do, what they can't, and how to approach a situation based on their abilities. This extends into the multiplayer as well. Have a buddy to argue with whether short-range or long-range is better? Now you can try them both out at the same time in a multiplayer run. Within multiplayer, two people can choose to either both play as Nina, both play as Ace, or each play as either Nina or Ace. This allows for both players to approach the stage at their own pace, while working together.\n\nSpeaking of multiplayer, this option opens the door for a number of buddy-to-buddy gameplay experiences, such as racing through a stage to the boss, working together to complete challanges or take down a boss, or even just mess around and enjoy the chaotic atmosphere of the game. Just keep in mind the chaos does get worse as you continue through, so hope you're able to work with your partner by the end of the run.\n\nThe updates are scheduled via a countdown on the title screen. It seems like a general window for an update, but they seem to be scheduled on time according to the countdown. The updates are rather noticable, but consistent and they greatly benefit the game. With the latest update, a great deal of stability was added to the multiplayer. I used what would be the gaming equivalent of a potato to host a game with my brother, and the connection maintained throughout the playthrough. This was without a game booster. Pre-update, occasionally the game would lag and lock out my brother from the game, even with a booster.\n\nOverall, when I started playing this game, I felt like I was playing a good-old Mega Man X game again. How I longed for those days and their glorious return.... Anyone who has played a game like this before should definitely give this game a try. I guarantee a fun time, whether you play solo or with a buddy.

It's close, but it's just severely missing a \"fun\" factor.\n\nThe random levels makes finding power ups a chore, and as another reviewer said \"a death trap.\" As there may or may not be anything there or a way to get back.\n\nThe bosses are lame at best, just glorified level creeps. With the level challange to beating them being the level, itself, becoming more difficult as they get harder. With no story it's hard to find a reason to care about fighting them.

It really pushes you to improve when death is permanent.\n\nLevels have been very entertaining, and the fact they are random means there can be no full memorization of the layout, which means it relies a lot more on reactions and skill than memory.   Powerups are very nicely done, and the Core Augmentations definitely have that feel of a major powerup and change the look of your character.

You have your pick between two characters: Nina and Ace, whom are themselves mirrors of X and Zero respectively and their base playstyle is pretty much identical to how X and Zero functioned in X4; Nina has the traditional \"X\" Buster, and Ace emulates Zero's Z-Saber via some sort of arm-mounted-laser-buzzsaw, which somehow defies logic and slashes like a sword. I must reiterate that it is clear the gameplay they were trying to emulate in this was that of Megaman X4, which they almost completely and totally nailed. Personally, X4 was my favorite of the X series, but if for some reason you didn't care for it, that's something to consider.\n\nYou start out with dash capabilities ala all the X games going forward from X2. Each session begins with you inside of the \"Ark\", a hub paying homage to the pre-Sigma boss rush rooms of yesteryear. From the Ark, you can swap between Nina or Ace, spend Soul Nuts (Explained Later), or enter into a run of the game with each teleporter sending you to a different difficulty setting, with the higher teleporters leading to special leaderboard runs like daily challenges you can only attempt once per day. Choose your character, pick a teleporter, and the game itself begins proper.\n\nThe game, as mentioned earlier, is a Rogue-lite. You progress through procedurally generated Megaman X style platforming levels, fending off numerous enemies and manuvering around enviromental hazards. Throughout the level, you'll find scattered crates and which will contain either health or energy pickups, or power-ups, along with chests that are guarenteed to contain a power-up usually waiting behind gauntlets of enviromental hazards you have to manuver in-and-out of to claim your prize. The level design is not entirely linear, but only in one tileset will you potentially find yourself \"confused.\" The golden rule in everywhere but the Skytemple is simply \"go right\", which will eventually always lead you to the end. The Skytemple breaks this rule by having sections that require you to traverse intricate vertical jumping challenges which may send you in either direction before eventually letting out on a higher, right-most platform, so until you've memorized all the potential tiles, it is the only one where you may find yourself actually \"lost\" in. Occasionally, beyond the first stage, you will also come across halfway-point enemy gauntlet rooms that will offer you a core power-up if you can complete the rush whilst adhering to specified limitations (No dashing, no powers, only powers, etc), along with traders who will offer you powerups of all varieties in exchange for Nuts (again, explained later). On top of all this, defeating the stage boss within a certain amount of time (a number of minutes increasing slightly with each stage you pass) will gain you a bonus chest, so in the end the game simultaniously encourages and rewards exploration and skillful manuvering, but punishes too much lollygagging within a single stage.\n\nPower-ups will improve your character for the entire duration of your run in various ways. They include things like increased health or energy, new weapons to replace your default, or things that provide entirely extra functionality. They also come in two flavors: normal and \"core\", with core powerups usually giving a fancier effect, and visually replacing a piece of your armor in homage to the old upgrade capsules of the MMX franchise. On top of that, each time you successfully complete a stage and down a boss, you are given the choice of either absorbing that boss's main power, binding it one of a couple of extra, otherwise unused keys/buttons, or picking between a randomized upgrade or a batch of Nuts. The various flavors of power-ups become more and more mandatory as you progress further into a run, which means that ignoring exploration in favor of rushing the boss room can potentially result in you being extremely underpowered in the later stages.\n\nSo I've explained what makes the gameplay itself properly rogue-lite, but what is it that brings in the comparison to Rogue Legacy? What is the carry over that makes playthroughs beyond the first appropriately interesting? Well, that comes in the form of previously mentioned Nuts and Soul Nuts. Nuts are the game's currency, dropping randomly from enemies and crates. Within a run, Nuts can be spent either on randomly located vending machines which will disperse either health or energy depending on the machine type, along with a power-up related to said resource if you cram enough Nuts into a machine to make it explode (Max health up if you blow up a health machine, for example.), along with Traders who will offer power-ups in exchange for large amounts of Nuts, along with one option usually heavily \"on sale\" for cheap, so even if you are low on Nuts you can usually walk away from a trader having gained something. The amount of nuts you get will vary based on power-ups you obtain and just random luck, and all of them are lost upon death...with one exception.\n\nThroughout runs, you will come across the occasional enemy that glows with a blue hue, sporting increased health and damage than its normal counterpart. Kill these, and they will leave behind glowing blue Soul Nuts, usually in batches of 1 to 4. Soul Nuts do not appear in your Nut count during the run, but instead are carried with you back to the Ark upon death. Back in the Ark, there is a Trader on the westmost side whom will allow you to spend Soul Nuts to unlock new power-ups that will then be able to drop in future runs, or, if you have already unlocked all the power-ups/want a bit of an advantage on your next run, you can instead spend them on his upper selection of lesser power ups that will then carry with you into your next run. Anything you freshly unlock will also be given to you for free on your next run, provided you do not exit out of the game prior to it. Do note that you cannot bring any of these \"starting boons\" into the difficulties above Normal.\n\nWhen it comes to pros and cons, I can happily say that as least in my experience, there are very few cons and none of them really outweigh the pros. The main gripes I have mostly have to do with art design of all things. Keep in mind that all of this is subject to change, both due to the game being in Early Access and also because of updates in general as I very easily see these developers continuing to support the game beyond leaving Early Access (Provided it is adequately successful, which it ENTIRELY deserves). Unfortunately, I'm running out of space for this review, so I can't really list those in the detail I would like to.\n\nThe long and short of it: If you are a fan of the Megaman X games, especially X4, buy this immediately. It captures the core gameplay of X4 *almost* perfectly, and is well supported by its developers. This is probably the closest we'll get to a proper MMX successor, unless Capcom pulls their head out of their ass in regards to the Megaman Franchise, and most would probably agree that isn't likely to happen any time soon. 20XX is the best MMX game I've played in years, even though it isn't actually MMX. It's cheap (especially on sale), extremely fun, and is all but guarenteed to please any old grizzled MMX fan.\n\nGive it a try.

Get this game immediately. Seriously, don't even read the rest of this review, it's a waste of your time, you could be playing 20XX. If you aren't hooked already, don't worry, this game is definitely good enough to stand on its own merits.\n\nMega Man X (or Zero, if you play Ace like me) meets roguelike: the game in a nutshell. You play through the game as Nina or Ace. Nina is a ranged character with a buster capable of charged shots, while Ace is a melee character with a three hit combo, though he can also charge the first swing of his sword for double damage. The characters function the same, essentially, though Ace has just a tiny bit more natural mobility and hp than Nina to accomodate his gameplay style (go fast, kill, repeat).\n\nYou go through a tutorial run which does a very nice job of explaining the gameplay mechanics via gameplay and small sections of on screen text, but after that... heheh. During runs you come across chests. Break these suckers open to acquire: health/energy/nuts, upgrades that can give you boosts to stats, such as attack or speed, upgrades that can grant new abilities, like double jumping, mid-air dashing, orbital shields, etc., or switch out your standard weapon for something a little more shiny, all of which can dramatically change how you play the game from that very point forward, or at the very least keep you alive ;) You may also find vending machines for health or energy. They'll keep you in good condition... provided you have the cash. At the end of your run you fight a boss! Go figure. Beat his ass and then you can either take his power, some cash, or a low-tier upgrade. Beat the stage before the bonus timer runs out and you get an additional chest with who knows what inside!\n\nWhat keeps things interesting? As you beat levels, the following levels become more difficult. More enemies.TOUGHER enemies. More obstacles. Harder platforming. Stronger bosses. The longer you go, the harder it gets, in every way. Hopefully you've been stacking those upgrades and earning some nuts... However if you find the normal run too easy, or just not enough fun... Turn some skull modifiers on. Double the length of all levels, make even MORE enemies spawn, make those enemies act faster and hit harder, turn level obstacles into instant death, do a run with no nuts (hahahaha...), no stat boost drops, make it so the game doesn't end until you die or are done with being immortal. It's up to you.\n\nCO-OP?!?!?! That's right, you can do two player runs, either locally or online! You can choose either character, there is no \"You're Tails, I'M SONIC\" bs. In local co-op, the screen will expand to fit both players according to the distance between them (similar to Smash Bros. if you've played that), but online, you get your default screen view. Items drop for players the same way but will be labeled with \"P1, P2\" for their respective player.  Right now the game is in beta, so online play... it's not perfect, but by no means should you avoid it entirely. There's a bit of lag, and some bugs in the safehouse, but a solid experience nonetheless.\n\nUSE A CONTROLLER. It says to use an X360 but... anything similar is probably okay (I use a logitech f310 gamepad). The controls are super tight, exactly like the titles that inspired this one. The level design can honestly be a tad frustrating at times, but if you remember to open your eyes, breathe, and think about what you're doing, you'll get through it (also unlock double-jump as soon as you can lol).\n\nYeah right now the game is $11.99? Final sale price will be $15. Worth every penny now, and this game is trending up. There is a lot care put into this game and it shows.

A series that endured and always delivered what it promised. Hard as nails difficulty over a wonderful soundtrack delivered with the same gameplay time and again. In todays market, many complain that games are \"too similar\" or \"Don't do anything to advance the series\" in an accusation of being stale. This is true in some cases, but I've never felt it a negative for others. Megaman was one such series that never grew stale for me. From 1 to 8, then X through X3. I was late to the playstation, so X4 and X5 were missed for me in the beginning. Later, the series would return in the form of Collectors packages (The Megaman Collection, and the X Collection). Again, it proved that there was a desire for these old games, even though mostly unchanged (They did some amazing work with the music in those collections). Then, radio silence. Megaman was abandoned by the company (certainly not the creator, who fought hard for it) and a wonderful idea was thrown away. Megaman Universe. It was a sore disappointment to hear of a game that would play like Megaman, with huge crossover potential and player created levels would be here for limitless potential of fun. Though, it seems that dream lived on in this game.\n\nBatterystaple Games picked up the torch that Megaman universe attempted to produce, and began running as hard as they could. For an indie developer, I'm personally amazed at how well they've done here. The game controls as great as any side scrolling platformer of yesteryear or even today. Better than most others. Controls are tight and gameplay is fluid. Never have I felt a cheap death through bad hit detection or input. The only advice I can give, is that the controller is a necessity. Keyboard just isn't going to cut it here. That said, controls on some indie games are shoddy and clearly needed fine tuning in early access or alpha stages. Not so here. Even in Alpha, Batterystaple nailed it.\n\nLevel design is another area I was nervous about. Roguelikes are a popular breed right now, but often a voxel world is used. Easy enough to procedurally generate, it's significantly harder to do this with side scrolling, non-voxel elements. I was concerned many levels and layouts would look the same. While, Yes, there are a few times in my five hours (and growing) I saw a usual layout, it was always blended into a previous layer or later layer seamlessly. Thankfully, the level design also doesn't reuse different platform layouts in the same level. Meaning it won't be a direct mirror of somewhere in the same level. Speaking of level design, again this is quality stuff from indie developers. Batterystaple really captured level design here, and staged the levels based on how many bosses you've beaten. Level 1 is short with one boss. Level 2 is longer, with a sub boss station. The station features a challenge such as no boosting, not getting hit, or timed completion to give you a reward. Then, later levels have the same layout, but spike throwers added in. By Level 5, the enemies are getting upgrades too. With changed colors (Oh, good ol' pallette swap) come added fireballs. 3-way shots turn to 5. One burst of lasers turn to three. Again, the level ramp-up just proves that rogue like runs in a procedural generation can be done, and done well, if the developer has the right formula to use. These guys sure did.\n\nGraphics and Music. This areas great in one, and pretty good in the other. Graphics are perfect to me. They recall the classic 16-bit era with perfection and at no point did I feel the enemies were complete copies of the game that inspired this. Instead, they were the developers own take on them, and done well with their imaginative creations. The music is pretty good, but the one thing I feel could use some help. Not that they're bad, but the same four tunes seem to stand out, especially when certain levels are reused for two bosses. This isn't a negative, by no means, but something that Batterystaple can surely hit on with their race to release. Whats in here is great, to be sure. I just feel theres room for more. \n\nOverall, I know it's early alpha, but for the price, I can't argue buying it right now. Help these developers along and get them to release day on this with the money they deserve for putting such a great game into our hands. They took a classic that was once amazing and revitalized it in the way it's own parent company refused long ago. Mighty No. 9 is due to come out soon and while I'll be playing that as well, I feel there are things Batterystaple did here in 20XX that Mighty No. 9 hasn't done yet (and i'll certainly be playing both of these). Perhaps an endless mode is in the cards for that game too, but i've yet to hear of it. 20XX though, it's like an endless mode every time you start. With powerups to buy that drop in the generated levels, daily and weekly seeded challenges to play for fun or bragging rights via leaderboards, Co-op, modifiers that change the game with significant things like \"spikes make you die\" mode, and a second playable character with a laser sword to alternate with, I honestly cannot say anything better about 20XX than i've already said. This games entirely worth it, if you have any love for sidescrolling platformers, and especially the forgotten Megaman franchise, don't wait for a sale. Buy this game and show the love. You won't be disappointed with this.\n\nPros:\n-Revitalized side-scrolling platformer genre with the perfect 16-bit look and feel\n-Procedural Generation of levels combined with Rogue Like power up system make each new playthrough different.\n-Perfect controls and perfect accuracy of side scrolling just \"feels right\"\n-Co-op, Daily, Weekly, and Modified Weekly challenges make a great way to keep interest.\n-Price is great for this. At 12 bucks, it seems a steal. If on Sale, it pretty much is. The games fully playable with almost no problems found in most Early Access/Alpha games. Polished right from the start.\n\nCons:\n-Layouts can sometimes start to feel a bit samey if the generation puts some similar components together a few times in a row.\n-Music is the same four to five songs. While nice, it will be noticable in a longer run including same areas.\n\nA final statement. Cons are included just as some feedback. In no way do I find these actually negative, as I have played right through and enjoyed every single thing. I merely put them for points where improvement could be done (and most likely will be, given the developers excellent track record of updates.). Overall, it's feedback and not meant to dissaude anyone. \n\n-M-", "timestamp_created": 1453471012, "timestamp_updated": 1453471521, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "20667126": {"recommendationid": "20667126", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007816071", "num_games_owned": 563, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 61, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452981029}, "language": "english", "review": "If you like Megaman X, don't buy this game.\n\nEarly access or not, the mechanics are far from refined as Megaman X. There's little to no feeling of feedback from everything you do, from shooting people or to even landing. Some sound effects that should exist are completely absent, such as certain enemies being hit by bullets.\n\nThe character designs are awful as well. They're unoriginal for one, but also very unappealing. Nina, the blue character, has overly animated hair despite wearing a helmet and giant anime eyes that stick out much more than they should, and her alternate colors, when you're player two and player one is also Nina, are absolutely atrocious.\n\nThe second character, whose name I didn't even care to remember, is entirely forgettable. His alternate weapon, a blender, you can find, is shorter range and garbage, where as Nina's is a four way shot which completely destroys bosses. Meaning, this character gets nothing but worse, on top of his hideous design, a weird buzzsaw on a stick that is somehow a sword sometimes and awkwardly fitted on the rest of his body.\n\nThere's very few tiles as well. Barely an hour in, and repeating levels became an issue already. The very idea of this being roguelike might be interesting, but then comes severe issues with it. Without speed items, the game is incredibly slow and dull. And if you ever die and lose all your speed buffs, you'll be reminded of how miserable it can be.\n\nThis game shouldn't be in Early Access, it feels as thought it's in an alpha state. But some early access games, such as Starbound, end up releasing in an alpha state of their game. In other words, 20XX may never get more refined in its gameplay, and it may never be worth the money you spend on it.

The developers update it every 2 weeks, yet in it's current state it's addicting and very worthwhile to purchase. Especially because it's going to get more expensive over time.\n\nedit: Everything afterwards is the post-early access build review.\n\nThis game is my favorite procedurally generated game right now. The first 8 levels are perfect. They have character and fun bosses, and the powers interact with the game in cool ways ie, you can make disappearing platforms solid with one of the powers, or block icicles with the flame shield.\n\nThe last 2 levels are fun, but because they incorporate all of the elements from all of the previous levels, they don't really have character imo. That makes sense, but I wish that somehow level 10 had some new elements to give it an identity. I also feel like level 9 is out of place in the main branch of the game. It kind of feels like it should be a secret side mission with a really cool reward or something like that because it feels more like a platforming challenge or gauntlet mode than a level. \n\nI like all of the bosses in this game except 1 (eternal star). All except him have strengths and weaknesses and you can read their patterns so that they don't do cheap shots. That one boss is really only a problem for  the melee character unless you have some good ranged powers or the spear because he creates a lot of visual clutter around himself so he becomes hard to see sometimes.\n\nAnyway, despite some problems, I love the game. 9/10", "timestamp_created": 1451764621, "timestamp_updated": 1503083223, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498994", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20217909": {"recommendationid": "20217909", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993477715", "num_games_owned": 456, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 624, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502986000}, "language": "english", "review": "Pro:\n+ 2 Characters\n+ Co-Op\n+ \"MegaMan X\"-like control scheme\n+ replayability\n+ music\n\nCons:\n- repetitive enemys\n- unoriginal stages\n- huge RNG Factor within the upgrade system\n- without the right upgrades regaining health can become very difficult up to impossible\n\n20XX can be a great game. Right now it isn't. I like to play. It's addicting. The movement is flawless, but you heavily rely on the RNG the game tosses at you. You don't get enough or the right upgrades? Well, you're fucked. Sometimes you find yourself beating a boss but not taking his ability because a basic upgrade is more viable. \n\nThe stages don't differ enough. There are 3 to 4 basic graphic sets I guess. Some enemys are scattered throughout all stages. Nearly every stage feels similiar to the previous one.  Similar enemys, similar visuals, similar jump parts.\n\nearly access games are something special. You'll never know if the game gets finished.

Approvals all around mostly. Enemy designs look FAR BETTER than the player designs. (If you're going to copy Mega Man in the glorious X~X4 days, why not make it look that good all around?)\n\nOn the other hand, it's a Roguelike/Roguelite(?) - meaning that failure is just about inevitable unless you get a win condition/conditions during your run, a few glitches in a few stages render that precision platforming impossible alongside swarms of enemies that respawn when off-screen, useless lies of powerup pickups** and on a personal level - luck is trash**. Also, the playable character designs are eyesores - the \"X\" equivalent looks terrible, as does the \"Zero\" one, \"Zero\" is slightly less annoying to the eye. The game is in \"Early Access\" as well, so if you run screaming due to that, I don't blame you. It houses many a glitch - the most annoying of which being that whenever you start the game up, the game considers you WiiToddEd and INSISTS on showing you what pickups do (Health, Currency, Useless tokens, etc.) AGAIN, obscuring your screen for the duration of any pickup - not just the roguelike \"weapons and passives\" that you'll hopefully find.\n\n**In reference to luck, I haven't found anything worth using in several playthroughs, and that lack of boosted ability / powers will absolutely rear it's ugly head within 2-3 stage completions. Furthermore, the game touts \"FIND SECRET PATHS / OPTIONAL PATHS TO FIND POWERUPS AND UPGRADES!\" There aren't many. What I think is a secret usually ends up being health loss + fall into a pit after skillfully following a platform to a roof of some sort..\n\n*Powerups that aren't explicit benefits (and many that are!) are pretty useless. This isn't Binding of Isaac where powerups are EVERYWHERE and can be quickly amassed for actual gains. This is 20XX, where one item that boldly claims \"Enemies drop more health powerups!\" will follow with \"I killed 75 more enemies, and haven't found a single health pickup! I had to beat that last stage with one bar of health! Not ONE DROP!\". Many of the items are actually death traps. Speed increases? A particularly harrowing pickup that disables your ability to use special weapons at the cost of boosted strength? The air dash in particular is a let down. Should be a double jump instead!\n\n(***The game also has a nasty little bug I've run into. The aforementioned \"point I'll get to in a bit\", is here. Sometimes, the game loves to snuff out your jumps! If you hold down the dash key after dashing, every jump you do is a \"Dash Jump\" or empowered jump that goes faster, generally farther. If you're on a moving platform doing this, it may not allow you to jump, rendering you dead VERY VERY FAST. This is something that's unacceptable when combined with a certain level's difficulty curve compared to others..)\n\n\n\nDo I recommend it? Needs more balancing before I can give a clear yes or no. I'm leaning to \"No\" because the gameplay \"learning curve\" is out of tune. Plus I've just had no good runs in my time with it. This is an early access \"early-thoughts\" review.\n\ntl;dr - Don't pick SkyTemple stage unless you're ready to deal with fake difficulty. It's a stage that's 2-7x as long as the others and combined with many ANNOYING enemies that have shot reflection/block, rain down lasers, and has more general platforming than any Mega Man X series game has ever needed?

After some time though I gave it another try and now I'm hooked. \n\nIt's still difficult, no doubt exacerbated by the fact that I'm playing on a keyboard and not a controller, as the game rightly recommends. The challenge of it though, is part of what makes it so appealing. It's also what will likely keep its replay value very high.\n\nThere's two playable characters, one with a blaster and one with a saber (sound familiar?). Where the game really differs from others (AHEM) like it, is that rather than having set levels, the levels are randomly generated, though you'll see a lot of familiar and recycled set ups. Levels and bosses increase in difficulty the further along you go. Things start out innocuous enough, but after you defeat three bosses or so, the game get down right cruel. You'll gather numerous power-ups along the way to assist you and collect nuts (insert one of the litany of \"nut\" related jokes in the game here) to purchase  others. The randomly generated levels ensure that things stay interesting as you'll probably never play the same level twice.\n\nThe one drawback with randomly generated levels though, is that it's hard to feel like any progress is being made in the game. You get ONE life. If you die, you have to start all over. That can be more than a little frustrating. I gather though that the intention is not so much to make progress in the game per se, as it is to make progress in your SKILL with the game. That's perhaps more rewarding than just beating a level (in theory, at least). \n\nWhat would be ideal, is to see a story mode that does have a complete and tidy, level-by-level, boss-by-boss playthrough experience in addition to the \"challenge run\" style the game is in currently. Perhaps your progress in the challenge run can have some bearing on the story mode (unlocking powerups and so forth)? The game is still in development, so who knows what the developers will come up with.\n\nIt bares mentioning that most of the music is really phenomenal, with the perfect retro 16 bit upbeat techno-rock-guitar feel to accompany the game. Many of the tunes are infectiously catchy. Also, the platformer obstacles are definitely more challenging and creative than just about anything I've encountered in the Megaman or X games. You will need some serious precision timing and masterful finess with your jumping and dashing to acquire many of the powerups scattered throughout the leves. \n \nOverall, 20XX is stupidly fun to play--especially for an old Megaman veteran like myself--and challenging enough to keep me coming back. The one thing lacking is a sense of progression through the game (beyond building skill and buying powerups to use in casual mode). I appreciate the familiarity of it, as well as the the novel elements like the various powerups and array of ways to make the game MORE difficult (told you the developers knew what they were doing). Perhaps I'm just a nostalgic gamer hungry for a little bit more of the familiar parts of the game. Regardless, the game is well made and deserves your attention, certainly if you're a fan of Megaman.

People will not always have a controller, why not make it possible to use the keyboard and mouse. Since it is on the desktop and not a bloody console? (My Wired 360 Controller keeps disconnecting at random, and that causes me to die alot.)\n\n4. Player Base = Is it me? Or the Player Base is so barren, youd have more luck finding people in the middle of nowhere. It feels so dead and desolate, like really desolate.\n\n5. Soul Bolts = This one is rather confusing, so normal bolts and soul bolts? Whats the bloody diffrence? Really? You lose the normal bolts when you die (Look up number 1.) and you keep the soul bolts? but thats just silly on its own. Cause when you die, the game forces you to spend the soul bolts unless you want them to vanish? Really? So you die and want to get more and you lose them if you start another mission? What the hell is the reason for that? Arbitrary Grind Fest?\n\nThe graphics is kinda good, but in a bland kind of way. But not in a bad bland way, just meh at best. Enemy A.I.? Is there any?

Nina and Ace only have two \u201calternate\u201d main weapons, and one for each is ridiculously rare. Ace\u2019s range-reducing, but theoretically more powerful, multi-slash feels more like a nerf than a buff. Thematically, the differences between Nina and Ace are limited to gun vs \u201cknife\u201d; in arguably my favorite MMX game, MMX4 (You can\u2019t make  me pick just ONE, okay!), X reflects the classic Mega Man character with special powers based upon defeated enemies manifesting themselves as projectiles, in addition to my favorite feature of MMX, hidden upgrades; Zero, on the other hand, gains Street Fighter-style powers, including a \u201cDragon Punch\u201d-style flame sword, an ice stalactite \u201cspike\u201d move, or a somersault slash. Ace gains none of these things, and his powers beyond his basic attacks are identical to Nina\u2019s. I would like to see more variance.\n\nAnother flaw to 20XX is its randomization algorithm. I have unlocked many things after several deaths, but I encounter the same upgrades over and over in a single run. To play with the more fun stuff that requires large sums of soul nuts, I have to start a \u201ccasual\u201d run and select three of my powerups as defaults. It is one thing to be difficult, and normal mode is no more challenging than casual besides gaining three powerups to start; if I don\u2019t care about leaderboards and just want to enjoy the game, why would I ever select a mode beyond casual? \u201cSkulls\u201d add objectives to runs, but I would currently not bother to attempt them until I felt confident that good powerups would spawn.\n\nOverall, I think 20XX has the potential to be an adequate proxy for a licensed Mega Man game. We shall see in the near future if it will be remembered as flattery or artifice. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1445221598, "timestamp_updated": 1445221598, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497625", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "18541002": {"recommendationid": "18541002", "author": {"steamid": "76561197963980859", "num_games_owned": 71, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 357, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470777035}, "language": "english", "review": "It's Mega Man for 2015 and beyond.

This game is awesome. I suggest you get it now and watch it as it grows with its updates!\n\nPros\n\n+ Megaman-like game. Think Magaman X. \n+ Rogue-Like. It is a very fun one, even if I died, I felt like just jumping right back in.  Something I feel is lacking in other rogue-likes.\n+ Unlockables. Granted there is not too many right now, but I like the feeling of earning a lot of soul bolts, and getting new stuff to find in the game.\n+ Co-op. I have not been able to play a lot of it, but the little I did, I enjoyed, a lot. You share items, but you also share bolts.\n+ Full Controller Support. If you are not using a controller in this game, your going to have a hard time, trust me, I tried.\n+ There is probably more, but this is the main ones. ^^ \n\nCons.\n\n- Sky Temple hazards. These can be run killers. I am not a huge fan of them, but oh well. Some of the hazards in the sky temple are very hard, but most of the others are fully fair.\n- Some of the character's movements seem a little off, but that is a nitpick.\n- Soul bolts after you unlock everything right now are kinda useless. But I bet they will be fixing this soon.\n- Keybored play. It is very, veeeeery hard to play as well as you can on a controller. Good luck if you wish to try.\n\nI love this game. I have 8 hours in at the time of writing this. That might be higher by a lot when you read this. $12 for a awesome game right now. Very worth it. \n\nSome things I hope for:\n* Character customization. Mainly just colors, kinda like if you have 2 Nanas.\n* Secrets. They will add more to exploring the area, giving you another way to louse time. xD\n* Space area.

As a long time Mega Man X fan, I have dreamed for a sequel of some sort to give me that action/platformer loving that I crave. From what time I have played, this game is definitely worth the buy in the sense that it already feels like a complete game; which is rather shocking considering its in EA and has a better quality than most 'launch' titles. The developers are also extremely active and helpful, which shows a lot of promise for this game's development.\n\nAs for gameplay, this is where it truly shines. The platforming is top-notch with many challenges for veterans and newbies to the genre, while also mixing in item drops to give it that Binding of Isaac feel. No one playthrough will ever be the same, and you can choose what order you would like to fight each boss. So if you completely hate one boss, you can skip it (most of the time), but that boss will get increasingly difficult as you put him off. So in some cases its best to just get it out of the way whenever possible, or you have the choice to tackle them when you have more upgrades. As seen in the intro vid, you can play as Nina (Mega Man) with the very familiar arm-gun to shoot enemies from afar, or Ace (Zero) with a beam saber for up close and personal balls-of-steel style gameplay. Each character can get weapon drops mid-game to completely change up how they use their current weapon as well, leading to multiple styles of gameplay within each character. If that's not enough, they added a daily challenge mode and a daily hardcore mode for players to sink their teeth into should they desire an extra bit of challenge. In the Challenge mode you can try to clear the game to make rankings on leaderboards, and in the daily hardcore you are faced with 3 skulls (or special scenarios) that change the way the game is played. These each reset once a day for your daily source of Mega Man action.\n\nLast but not least, this game has multiplayer. Granted, all of my friends are naysayers and don't believe in this game, but if you have ever wanted to play a Mega Man game with a friend this is your chance. Having played a few multiplayer games with strangers you can just jump in and murder everything with little to no communication. Gotta love mindless mayhem, cuz I do. ^_^\n\nOverall, I'm extremely pleased with this game. In fact, there really is not much to say about it negatively aside from one thing. The level 8 Sky Temple and go F*** itself. Having cleared the game multiple times, its the biggest nightmare of the game, and lasers will haunt your dreams.\n\nOverall in its current state, I give this game a 9.5/10.

I've never been a huge fan of Mega Man, but I do enjoy the games, and I've played them all. This is basically Roguelike CooP Mega Man, and that's great. It's pacing is super fun, and the enemy, item, upgrade and level variety is really quite expansive. Most of the enemies are just amped up versions of previous, weaker enemies, but that's fine. It still adds to the game quite a lot, in my opinion.\n\nIn the game there are two playable characters, one with a gun and one with a sword. Both do similar damage, but from what I saw the DPS of the melee character is higher, which makes sense considering he has to get in closer. There are also multiple weapons for each character that you can unlock and find within the game, which is really cool. Each weapon requires a different way of playing, and they all have their ups and downs. There are also powers which cost energy that you can acquire that equally change the battlefield, like a pack of fireballs that spin around you to block shots and hurt enemies, or a minigun that does decent damage over a good range. Lots of different powers.\n\nSomething I really like is the bonus timer: It incentivizes you to complete the level quickly, but it doesn't force you at all. The reward is an extra gold chest at the end, which contains an item or upgrade. Another thing is that each and every item and upgrade I've seen is actually substantial. I've never gotten something and thought, \"Well this is kinda crap.\" Yes, some are better than others, but there are no useless upgrades, and no incredibly op ones as far as I can tell. The game is balanced quite well.\n\nThere are no real BS enemies. Some are frustrating to fight, but once you learn the patterns of each enemy you can dispatch them fairly easily, unless the level layout kinda cheeses you a bit, but that doesn't happen often. The bosses are plentiful (I believe I fought 6, but there may be more.), and each boss plays differently. I read some other reviews where bosses are spammy and cheap, but each attack that a boss does gives you a new opportunity to attack them. As far as I saw, there are no stupid instakill moves, no invincibility moves, nothing like that.\n\nThe graphics are okay, nothing to write home about but not terrible to look at. The design of things is really good, it's just the execution leaves a tiny bit to be desired, such as assymmetrical sprites simply flipping rather than being drawn from each side. Overall it doesn't detract from the game much, and it's still nice to look at, so no big deal. The sound and music are pretty good, sort of generic but not bad at all. The music is fast and upbeat and helps to set the mood and pace of the game, which is all it really needs to do.\n\nIn the end, if you like action platformers (Mega Man), and you like roguelikes, pick this one up. Bonus for coop! Have yet to play it with a friend but I have just the person in mind.  ;)  Great game for the price and for the fact that it's in early access.

This is a title absolutely worth supporting.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/bcLt2rxZzHM", "timestamp_created": 1442267717, "timestamp_updated": 1442770977, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.667978", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "18007190": {"recommendationid": "18007190", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025141692", "num_games_owned": 593, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 462, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511589066}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is a love letter to Megaman X, combined with the additional mechanics of a roguelike a la Binding of IsaacIf you enjoy platformers and roguelikes, this is a must-buy.", "timestamp_created": 1442103694, "timestamp_updated": 1442103694, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.555981", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "17995866": {"recommendationid": "17995866", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011737943", "num_games_owned": 245, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2076, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509696543}, "language": "english", "review": "This is going to be about my opinions more than about my review so here it goes. Love how you came back to the old character designs and it came with some new animation to boot! It's much better than the last character update (they were kinda bad imo) that you guys implemented (God, Nina looks like she was pmsing at everything LOL.) You really captured my attention with the fluidity of the game and it feels so much like the old Megaman game(s) no lie.  With that being said I would like to see a is: \n\n1) Boss overhaul with new movesets. Would like to see bit more diversity when they attack me. I mean it wouldn't hurt to ask, right?\n\n2) Keep the stages but change the scenery with each new boss, because it was kind of repetative, and again imo. Like each 2 boss would have the same stage but seemed like it was copy and pasted... I like a fresh new feel with each boss. \n\n3) Option for a savepoint (since some people are asking for it) in the cheats menu(or whatever its called).\n\n4) Maybe whenever I get a ability, like the mario hat for example (looks like a mario hat to me), Nina's or Ace's feet would get an upgrade in looks. \n\n5) Option to continue when you beat every boss in story mode? :) or maybe give us the option to continue in the cheats menu? \n\n6) True final boss? I mean \"SPOILERRRRRR\" if it is considered as spoiler:\n\n\n\n\nthe roller boss did mention in the dialogue about a mother (If I remembered correctly). Maybe the mother can be the true final boss? idk I'm just giving out ideas.\n\n7) Option to change Nina and Ace's color would be nice. Playing as red Nina or blue Ace would be awesome!\n\n8) And Lastly, keep up the fantastic work with the community. I mean not many developers would interact with the customers/community like you do.\n\nAlthough this game still have a long way to go as it's still in early access, I feel like this game would be in the colection of many who loves the original Megaman! Whenever I play this game it feels like nostalgia just hit me and with every new stage a challenge awaits me. I would really recommend this game to anyone who is really interested! It's only 12 dollars (at the moment of this review) and the developer is really interactive with the community of this game (I can't stress this part enough about the developer).  Plus side about this game is that it updates about every 2 weeks so that's a win win in my book!

Looks like an online flash game. \n6) Asymetrical sprites are obviously flipped for left/right\n\nI think this game has a lot of potential and the reason i gave it a shot is because it had good support from the creators. Hopefully they can improve the game's reward system to feel less grindy and more like i accomplished something that actually mattered.

It plays and even looks like Megaman X, but in higher definition and add in a bunch of permadeath and random generation into the mix.\n\nOnce in the game you'll be platforming and shooting / slicing baddies until you reach the end where you'll fight a boss in an arena style setting, much like Megaman games. You can also collect various upgrades and weapons while traversing the RNG levels. These upgrades vary from passive effects, such as increase HP or attack power, to active effects such as a new primary weapon, or special ability. You'll also be able to dash, super jump, and you'll be utilizing the best of your platforming and side scrolling action skills.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrpovimyNgE\nThe gameplay stay true to the Megaman formula but since it throws in a bunch of roguelike elements, such as RNG levels and enemy placement, it does suffer from level design when compared to the game's inspiration. Megaman games have always been known for challenging but memorable levels. With 20XX's dependence on randomly generated levels, it doesn't have the same impact in level design as original Megaman games. To contrast this critique, what the game gives up in hand designed levels, it makes up in replayablity, and variety. The game also offers 2 characters to play as. Nina, and Ace. I feel the game needs to take a look into the balance of the 2 characters, as Ace is by far much easier to use and often I do much better with him as a result.\n\nThe art and sound design are great. It emulates Megaman X games well, except brought into the modern age of 1080 and 60FPS. I don't have much complaints about it's presentation. Every thing about how the game look and sound does a great job of paying tribute to it's inspiration.\n\nOverall 20XX is a very enjoyable roguelike/lite and the idea of mixing Megaman mechanics into the genre paid off. I feel the 2 genres are a great mix that seem so obvious once you play it!\n\nPros:\n- Excellent tribute to Megaman games\n- Plays and feels great!\n- Lots of replayablity and experimentation potential\n\nCons:\n- Reliance on RNG level design show some flaws\n- Some minor imbalances between the 2 selectable characters\n\n20XX hours played: 1.5\n\nCompletion Status on 20XX: N/A\n\nThis copy of 20XX was given by the developers for review", "timestamp_created": 1440002665, "timestamp_updated": 1440002665, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.689495", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "17615496": {"recommendationid": "17615496", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025796747", "num_games_owned": 3638, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 3186, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512658426}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]Pros[/h1]\nRoguelike Mega Man X\nAmazing soundtrack\nPlatforming and combat feels so good\nPermanent upgrades and unlocks\nA lot of interesting/hidden mechanics (boss weaknesses to powers)\nCo-op, both local and online\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\nAfter many hours into the game the level chunks will feel the same\nLevel 9 is brutal and requires good movement attributes/some specific powers/insane platforming skills\n\nAmazing in Early Access as it was slowly iterated upon, and the finished product is highly impressive. 20XX is a procedurally generated platformer heavily reminiscent of Megaman games. I must confess, I've never previously played any Megaman game - I was too young at the time. And yet, this game sucked me in with its lovely 2D sprites and gameplay, proving you don't need to be a Megaman aficionado to enjoy this game!\n\nFor the most part, the game felt incredibly responsive and fun to play. The default keyboard controls felt a bit awkward but manageable, I got used to them after a while. Of course, it is slightly less awkward to play the game with a controller (if you, like me, were migrating from keyboard to gamepad, it definitely takes some getting used to). Levels are procedurally generated based on pre-built level chunks strung together in various orders, and also scale based on how far you've gotten through your run, slowly ramping up the challenge.\n\nOther features of the game include 2 characters - Nina (ranged) and Ace (melee), both with their own unique weapons and features. There are multiple possible weapons for both characters that can be found throughout the level, and they are all interesting to try out and play. On a personal note - I prefer playing Nina due to the range, but Ace has some pretty sick weapons.\nSoul Chips, a currency which you can find during your run, allow you to buy more items which you can then find in-game. Even as you bleed the level chunks dry for content you can still find new items in-game allowing your runs to become crazier.\n\nAnother admission: I never really played the Daily modes or used the skulls all that much and am waiting until I become more proficient to do so, but they provide additional challenges for the skilled player. Skulls are mostly, if not all, drawbacks for the expert player, an interesting way to ramp up the difficulty.\n\nI really enjoyed the soundtrack too. One of the rare times where I don't actually mute the music and play something else, and the digital-ish(?) theme fits quite well with the game.\n\nLastly, my most favourite aspect of this is the multiplayer. Almost everything is best done with a friend or more, and this is no exception. Blasting and killing enemies with a friend where you team up is a whole lot of fun. The online multiplayer REALLY works quite well, very few hitches - just the occasional oddity which I'm pretty much chalking up to different regions for now.\n\nWould I recommend this game? Hell yes! A prime example of Early Access done right, and a model for budding EA developers to follow. Also, it's a far better Megaman-esque game than Mighty No. 9, so there.\n\n[h1]When to buy[/h1]\nNow.\n\n[h1][b]9.5/10[/b][/h1] \n\n[i]This game was previously demoed on the Who's Gaming Now?!

No other compensation was given.\n\n[b]Introduction[/b]\n==========\n20XX is finally out of Early Access on Steam and on version 1.0. Having played this as it evolved in Early Access, I can say that it has improved by staggeringly huge leaps and bounds. It has turned into a truly fantastic game. Boasting the tried-and-true Mega Man styled action platforming mixed with rogue-like elements, 20XX promises to be a great time. Let's dive in and see what its all about.\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\n==========\nThe game follows Nina and Ace, an armored girl and boy wielding an energy buster and sword in the aftermath of a robotic uprising. Traveling from their base on the Ark, an orbital space station, they are hired by an organization to clear out dangerous locations that are infested with robots that have run amok. The story is told through small stop-motion animated cutscenes peppered throughout the game, but they don't really convey what they are saying very well. But you know what? That's okay. This really isn't anything near what you would called a story-driven game, so it takes a backseat to the gameplay and other elements.\n\n20XX plays very similar to many action platformers, specifically drawing inspiration from the many Mega Man and Mega Man X titles. Nina and Ace both have primary weapons: an Energy Buster for Nina and an Energy Sword for Ace. If you have to make the comparison, Nina plays like Mega Man/X, and Ace plays like Zero. Both of them are able to charge their primary weapon for a more powerful blast or strike.\n\nBefore each run, you spawn in the Hub area. Here you can purchase permanent upgrades and items using Soul Chips you collect from special enemies and bosses. You can also swap between Nina and Ace as you please here. There are also portals to various daily and weekly challenges that record you score/time to the leaderboard.\n\nDuring your runs, you will traverse through 10 different stages, each with a boss and tons of hazards. The first 8 stages are the usual \"Robot Masters\", while the last two are the final bosses. In each level, you fight you way through various landscapes, collecting nuts (currency), spending them on upgrades (Attack Up, Movement Speed Up, Max HP+, etc), and collecting Armor Upgrades. To get the Armor Upgrades, you can either buy them if they appear in the random shops, or earn them in special Glory Zones. These zones present you with a specified challenge, such as defeating everything within a time limit, or reaching a specified point without being caught by pursuing enemies.\n\nThere is no limit to the number of upgrades you can get, and multiple copies of the same item stack their effects endlessly. However be careful with some, as they can make it harder to control Nina/Ace depending on the upgrade (Movement Speed Up comes to mind). Other items to collect are Tokens, which allow you a spin on the slot machine for possible items and upgrades. These are randomly found in levels, usually before a boss.\n\n[b]Graphics[/b]\n==========\nThis game looks like it would feel alright on an SNES or Genesis. Some complain that it looks like a flash game, but if you look things are a bit more detailed and more well animated than a flash game. Nina and Ace are both well designed and look great on screen. Each stage has a unique look and feel, and each boss is very animated. I love the overall presentation of 20XX. It really invokes the classic Mega Man feel, only in a more colorful manner.\n\n[b]Sound and Music[/b]\n==========\nThe game's soundtrack is comprised of chiptunes and synthesized tracks that give the sound of what might have been on the SNES. Each tune is very upbeat and full of action, and I absolutely love them. I'm glad the option to buy the game in a bundle with its soundtrack is available for just a few bucks more.\n\nThe sound effects are great. Attacks, charged shots, saber slashes, taking damage, death, enemies...all of it is very clear. Picking up items and power-ups has a very satisfying little jingle, very reminiscent of how Mega Man handled items.\n\n[b]Performance[/b]\n==========\nThe game runs beautifully. I observed a full 60FPS the entirety of my playtime (you can see the FPS counter at the bottom left of my videos, found below), even with a lot of action on-screen during a Hardcore run. 20XX has full controller support, in fact a controller is HIGHLY recommended. The default controls are very good, but can be reassigned to fit any player's tastes. They are very tight and responsive.\n\n[b]Final Thoughts[/b]\n==========\nOffering plenty of challenge, rogue-like elements, and good ol' action platforming, 20XX is one of the better Early Access success stories in recent years. Most people avoid Early Access titles due to many of them never being finished, but 20XX rose above them and came out on top. Definitely give it a shot if you get the chance!\n\n[b]Gameplay Demo[/b]\n==========\n[OUTDATED]\nNina:\nhttps://youtu.be/VY14McN7n74\n[OUTDATED]\nAce:\nhttps://youtu.be/p6CM7R23vfI\n\n[b]Nerd House Verdict[/b]:\n==========\n[h1][b]Highly Recommended[/b][/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1439409230, "timestamp_updated": 1504648904, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 70, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.757273", "comment_count": "14", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17509673": {"recommendationid": "17509673", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069586968", "num_games_owned": 138, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 2710, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511562399}, "language": "english", "review": "- Better than Mighty Number 9\n- Co-Op is insane fun\n- Better than Capcom as a whole\n- Delivers what Capcom is too stupid to\n- Fantastic MUST GET for ANY Mega Man fan out there !\n- The devs are really in touch with the community and listen to feedback !\n- X and Zero type gameplay", "timestamp_created": 1439409035, "timestamp_updated": 1439409035, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.589592", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "17498191": {"recommendationid": "17498191", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025165815", "num_games_owned": 407, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1091, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503783028}, "language": "english", "review": "My favorite game series ever is Mega Man X.

Firstly, this game is great, and it deserves your support.  If you enjoy the Megaman series of games or action platformers in general this is a no brainer.  It's an awesome roguelike in the style of Megaman with two playable characters and a good variety of enemies and level layouts.  You can find items in levels or at the end, with bonus incentives for completing a level quickly enough, and you unlock more of them as you play.  It's still early access, so there's a lot to come, but even as it stands I wholeheartedly recommend it.\n\nHowever, this game has so much more going for it than just what there is so far.\nFirstly, it's a totally reasonable price at $12, it'll go up a bit at official release, but even still I'd happily pay $20 or even a bit more with enough additional features.  Speaking of additional content, there's a timer on the title screen telling you when the next update with additional content is going to come out (about 5 days to the next as of writing this review) which is a level of accountability I've not seen in an early access game.  There are so many out there that you'll hear nothing from for months at a time, and they make a point of telling you at any time how long until more content comes out.\n\nLastly, the devs are great.  I read through other reviews and saw ones mentioning them giving feedback and listening to fans (such as adding in a three hit saber combo rather than just the same animation) which is always cool.  Then I had my own awesome experience with them.  I sent in some feedback with bugs I'd seen and ideas I had and within a few hours got an email from one of the devs who wasn't even in the office at the time thanking me for my feedback.  That's incredibly cool and fairly unprecedented from my own experience.\n\nSeriously, this is an awesome game made by awesome people and you should get it if you're even remotely interested.", "timestamp_created": 1438386692, "timestamp_updated": 1438386692, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.655958", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "17225824": {"recommendationid": "17225824", "author": {"steamid": "76561197962082784", "num_games_owned": 1374, "num_reviews": 281, "playtime_forever": 3527, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 237, "last_played": 1514355310}, "language": "english", "review": "Still early access, review date 7/25/2015\n\nRoguelike Mega Man X?

The levels are good, the bosses are fun, this is a solid game and easily worth playing even in its current early access state.

If you like Mega Man X and roguelikes this game is for you. With a solid selection of main weapons to find, special weapons to obtain, and very interesting power-ups, this game never fails to excite me (getting the Wave Beam in a run = Yessssssss!)\n\n   As you can see in the trailer, there are two characters: Nina (who uses ranged primary weapons) and Ace (who uses melee primary weapons). Both characters can charge up their primary weapon to dish out some nice damage. In co-op (locally or online) you can even have a team of Aces or Ninas if you wanted (although the synergy of a Nina and Ace team plays out well as each of them can cover for the other pretty well)\n\n   The game offers a lot of fun replayability. There are daily challenges, daily hardcore challenges, and you can even modify your runs with \"skulls\" in which add unique difficulty to you run (longer stages, more enemy health, toxin timer; just to name a few). I love to challenge myself to a run with maaaaany skulls activated, it is really fun! I highly recommend starting with one or two skulls and then every time you beat a run with skulls on, try to add another skull on for the next run to keep ramping up the difficulty; it's a great training method and it'll keep you occupied for many hours!\n\n   In short: This game is awesome and has high replayability with crazy challenges, stuff to unlock, cool bosses and special weapons, and sweet, sweet offline and online co-op.

That is not really a problem on early levels but as you advance, there is more and more stuff and they do more damage an they are harder to kill. So to emulate a higher difficulty, all the game does is putting more of the same enemies you fought earlier and they do more damage. You don't receive enough health to make up to it.

I'm pretty sure it meant : \"you are supposed to die and be mad about it\". \n\nKeep in mind that I've only played the game for 1 hour and it is not in it's completed state.

I did not notice that it was early access alpha though. I didn't notice until I'd already played for over an hour and loved every minute. The early access version is awesome as hell, and feels like a full game. It's easily worth the $10 already, and that fact that it's going to actually get better over time makes me a happy happy boy.\n\nThe controls are spot on, and feel comfortable to any MMX player. The graphics are serviceable without being so flashy as to distract from the gameplay. The music is good, and the sounds are good too. The bright shining star of the game is the gameplay. The mix of Megaman style platforming with roguelite upgrades and procedural levels make this a blast to play, and the Spelunky style daily challenges and leaderboards mean even veterans will always have stuff to do.\n\nEdit: It's been half a year since I posted this review. I still play 20XX at least every other day. There have been several really awesome changes, including replayable weekly challenges, co-op, and ever improving art.\n\nI was already happy with this. Now it's probably my favorite game of the year.\n\nEdit #2: It's been over a year now, and the game keeps getting better. The biggest recent change was the addition of the core aug system. Equivalent to armor parts from the MMX games. There are four sets with different focuses/boosts, and you can choose to mix and match parts from different sets to get your perfect combo, or try to complete a full matching set for a very powerful set bonus. OFC, since this game is a roguelite, you won't always be able to finish a set. \n\nOne boosts your charged attacks significantly, witrh the set bonus making EVERY attack charged.\n\nOne boosts your boss powers significantly, with the set bonus providing additional power specific effects, which range from mildly handy to ridiculously amazing. (Force Nova is glorious with it)\n\nOne boosts your defense, with a full set making you immune to spikes, lasers, and other stuff that would be an instant death when playing with the \"rock\" difficulty mod enabled, as well as all the boosts the individual pieces give, of course. It's VERY handy for daily challenges with that mod.\n\nThe last, so far, is focused on boosting your movement/stage clear speed, with the set bonus providing infinite air dashes. Find a decent high spot to launch from and you can fly across an entire level, assuming it's a horizontal level, and you have good timing.\n\nA year ago when I first reviewed this it was already tons of fun. Now, it's a game I will happily suggest to anyone that even kind of sort of likes Megaman games, roguelites, or just platformers in general. \n\nThe only flaw left in the game is the procedural level design, and that's just as much of a strength as a flaw.", "timestamp_created": 1433442430, "timestamp_updated": 1455889949, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.585747", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "16164576": {"recommendationid": "16164576", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037529877", "num_games_owned": 310, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 237, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1453333627}, "language": "english", "review": "Full disclosure the folks on the dev team for this game were in the booth across from ours at PAX a couple years ago and I met them and they were super cool.

Just a heads up.[/strike]\n\nIf you've enjoyed games such as The Binding of Isaac or Enter the Gungeon, yet also desired a new Mega Man game, I can certainly say this game is for you. 20XX is a roguelike action platformer that's [i]heavily[/i] inspired by the Mega Man franchise, specifically the Classic and X series. It was inspired so much that the first cutscene has a nod to Mega Man 2's Title Screen. In fact, lots of the things in this game give little nods or references to other game franchises, which I do appreciate.\n\nWhile there are only [strike]8[/strike] 10 levels in the game (with five/six locations being used total), you'd think the game could get stale rather quickly. That's where you would be wrong, as the levels are randomly generated (though with some common obsticles in between runs). While not extremely varied such as the likes of the Binding of Isaac and Enter the Gungeon, I find this rather acceptable for a game such as this. The boss order of the first eight bosses are guarenteed to be different between runs. One thing to note is that in this game, the bosses get [i]stronger[/i] the later you wait to fight them; such as having more health, more attacks, etc.\n\nBesides the usual singleplayer, you can play local or online Co-Op with a friend if you so desire and tackle the [strike]inevitable fate of death[/strike] world of 20XX together. There's also daily challenges, leaderboards, various difficulties (such as easy mode granting three lives to the player instead of the usual one), and more. You can also buy perma upgrades, unlock new ones, or start with upgrades in your next run using a currency known as \"Soul Nuts\". Soul Nuts are mostly gained from killing off strong enemies, which usually have double the health and deal double damage. However they vanish upon starting a new run, so spend them wisely.\n\n[i]EDIT: In the original review, I lacked to mention there was the ability to do online play in addition to local. And I must say, for a possibly \"littered with bugs\" part of the game, it worked quite well and was very enjoyable to play through! I tried this with a friend from another country to see how ping would impact the game, and it didn't seem to have much effect at all (aside from the final boss causing some ping issues). Not to say there weren't any bugs, but for the most part it was a rather clean experience.[/i]\n\nThe only real gripe I have with the game is that the dash is used a bit too often, and is mandatory for tons of jumps, especially in the last few levels in the game. Of course, it's not a bad thing, it's just a personal distaste of mine.\n\n\nOverall, I firmly believe 20XX was worth all the time and money I invested into it, even while the game was early in development. I [b]highly[/b] recommend giving this game a shot. [strike]Heh, get it?

From what I've seen thus far it works really well, though the game itself is very clearly in alpha and can use many changes.\n\nFor one thing, I feel the physics engine could use a bit of tweaking. This game is obviously trying to emulate Megaman X's physics, but it doesn't feel quite as smooth and satisfying(ex. The dash isn't really as effective unless you have the powerup that increases the dash's power.). For the most part, it works pretty well, it's just kind of rough around the edges at the moment.\n\nAnother problem I have is how the levels are designed. I was incredibly interested in the idea of having randomly-generated levels, but the levels seem to give off more of a rage game vibe than anything else. The time limit really doesn't help either. Sure, it adds a bit of intensity to really beat the level, but it puts you in a state of stress that Megaman games generally do not have. The bosses, however, I have no problem with.

Holy hell, this game is fast becoming straight up amazing! Kudos to the devs. I hope this game gets the attention it deserves eventually because now it's definitely an overlooked gem of a game.\n\nRe the bosses (as mentioned in my previous updates), they are great and extremely satisfying to beat now. Great job!\n\nOne thing though, the sound mixing seems to be a bit off. E.g. some sound effects seem a lot louder than others, but that's really all I can find to put my finger on now.\n\n[Updated. Original review below.]\n\nThis game has come a long way since I bought it and the updates continue rolling in, each one making the game even better. It already has a ton of content and you can sink lots of hours into the game as it is now. The bosses are even a bit harder and more varied now even though I still think they're a bit on the easy side. All in all this is shaping up to be a solid game that shows how Early Access [i]should[/i] be done.\n\n[Original review:]\n\nThis is definitely Early Access. The game shows promise but is extremely rough around the edges. (E.g. I get sent to some debug mode that's full of bright red collision boxes whenever I press 'start' to pause the game and it'll randomly go away if I pause/unpause again a few times... Maybe... And my weapon charges while I hold 'right' on the d-pad \u2014 not on the analog stick though \u2014 making it very difficult to actually move right and shoot. However, I expect both of these problems to be relatively rare since there isn't a torrent of complaints about them in the forums.) Bosses aren't exactly super challenging but I can't imagine they'll stay like that forever. The platforming is pretty tight and controls are very responsive and feel good. 20XX basically has all the ingredients of a great platformer, it just needs to put them together in the right amounts using the right recipe.\n\nIf you are willing to buy a game on a promise and think this could become an interesting game, then you should definitely buy this. At this very moment there's not a whole lot to it and \u2014 since it's Early Access \u2014 there may never become anything of it, but if platforming and roguelikes (e.g. Spelunky and Rogue Legacy) is your thing, this could be your next favorite game ... when it's done.", "timestamp_created": 1423004077, "timestamp_updated": 1448122635, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502075", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "14307173": {"recommendationid": "14307173", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041565248", "num_games_owned": 571, "num_reviews": 86, "playtime_forever": 1438, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509333957}, "language": "english", "review": "Mega Man X Fan?.

Or more dash speed\n+ Co-op -And the ability to revive your friend-\n+ The game will have a great story. Maybe better than Mega Man or as good as Mega Man~!\n+ Fans can help with feedback!\n\nCons:\n- Still in Alpha -Some things to change-\n- Some enemies hit you through walls where you can't hit them.\n- It's all about luck if you aren't a \"Pro\" at Mega Man you will have a hard time with Rogue Legacy's Items\n- No Easy/Medium/Extreme Difficulty.\n\nOverall I think this game will be mega awesome!. I hope this game will continue listening to his fans like it is now. And I hope we can comunicate with them to make the game better!.\n\n7,5/10 -Still Alpha-\n\nUpdated", "timestamp_created": 1422945396, "timestamp_updated": 1479944364, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "14293808": {"recommendationid": "14293808", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994864592", "num_games_owned": 397, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 72, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1426191891}, "language": "english", "review": "Rogue-like Megaman X where your health carries over from one level to another for increased difficulty.

Buy it to encourage a Indie-Company .\n\nFirst I was dissapointed with the Online feature being removed for a while , I love the fact that when you die , you die and need to start all-over. The random levels generator is pretty Unstable I would say , You can play 1 time and get 3 Hp bonus with the first 3 loot- crates or play another time and get the Freaking 4 leafed clover at the end of the first boss and struggle the second level like shit , To give you an idea , Sometimes I can get to level 8-9 without dying , But if Im unlucky with the random factor , I can barely pass the second level. It also feels that when you need Hp ,You wont find any, but when you're full Hp is raining from everywhere , and backtracking in this game isnt a thing, if you want to get the Bonus crate at the end of the level. \n\nI have played local multiplayer and its so hard , remind me of Contra with 2 players ( much more harder)\n\n\n But the question is : Should I buy this Game ? Yes and No i would say , If you love being tortured with megaman X You would love being torture by this one . If you're not into BDSM and oldschool-gaming you won't like it. \n\nBut yeah 9$ for a flash game think about it.(maybe when the Co-op Multiplayer will be back it will worth it)", "timestamp_created": 1421258450, "timestamp_updated": 1421258450, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "13954938": {"recommendationid": "13954938", "author": {"steamid": "76561197985036092", "num_games_owned": 10833, "num_reviews": 279, "playtime_forever": 147, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504531096}, "language": "english", "review": "Mega Man X fan?

There's a lengthy initial startup time when you launch but gone is the lag at menus and start starts. Characters feel more fluid and it just feels good to control either blaster user Nina or sword user Ace. They've also added a choice at the end of the level, so you're less likely to get the same level sets in a row now. Boss health was reduced though as their life meters aren't as crazy as they use to be. Haven't had the chance to play co-op yet but the single player experience has very much improved and I still recommend the game to fans of the genre. \n\nNovember 25th, 2014\n\nGame is pretty bare bones at the moment, the levels are randomized but in the 45 minute co-op session I played we did see a level repeat. Bosses are tricky and can be a bit frustrating but the controls work well and a controller definately feels at home with the game. The gameplay feels very much like what you'd find in a Mega Man X game and it's fun to have it in a native PC game. The music is catchy and the levels are bright but have odd gaps in them and invisible walls. Some of the enemies blend in too well with the environment or match the background palette and feel bland.\n\nFor co-op, when players get spread out the camera zooms out to accomadate both players yet, this means you can rush off ahead if you want but it'll become difficult to navigate as some environmental hazards can be hard to discern and some of the enemies that palette match the background become near invisible. Still, Apart from having the screen turn split-screen or not allowing you to outpace your partnet it works well.\n\nAlso, for co-op, if your partnet dies you can stand at their \"ghost\" and shoot to give them half your life.\n\nThe game shows a lot of promise right now, I just hope they keep developing and continue to add features. Don't get it expecting a near complete game because it's not at that point, this might not be fair but right now it feels a stage or two above a prove of concept demo and doesn't seem to be entirely optimized as the game hangs (for me) when loading and becomes unresponsive for 1-2 minutes before opening, and even then it doesn't focus the window.", "timestamp_created": 1416974078, "timestamp_updated": 1451933795, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.586305", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "13083844": {"recommendationid": "13083844", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043858125", "num_games_owned": 210, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1313, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511999118}, "language": "english", "review": "Tons of replayability, co-op, and difficulty.

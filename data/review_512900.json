In short, I\u2019d say it\u2019s a mash-up of \u201croguelike elements\u201d and class-based RPGs; While combat is certainly a big part of the game\u2019s mechanics, you can actually make it through the game without firing a shot, punching a person, or getting in any other sort of trouble. Choosing from many members of a motley crew of strange bedfellows, your goal is to climb the city... tower... thing to kill the mayor (or something like that). You do this by accomplishing missions on each floor, ranging from \u201cneutralize this target\u201d to \u201cfree this prisoner\u201d to \u201cblow up this entire building\u201d and then some.\n\nWhere this gets a little nuts is in the execution. Every character has their own unique attributes. The Hacker, for example, can both interact with electronics at range and access additional options on them that other people can\u2019t. The Soldier is very good with guns, starts with several, and even has a slight jab at regenerating health with their Modern Warfarer perk. The Cop gets handcuffs that can incapacitate anybody from behind, but also gets penalized for harming or cuffing innocents. In this regard your choice of character can radically impact how the game flows, although to be entirely honest, trying to play with others typically devolves into a \u201csmash and grab\u201d playstyle rather quickly. Speaking of which, the online play works surprisingly well for a title with this kind of budget, but there have definitely been some hiccups here and there (most of which were fixed a patch or two later).\n\nMy primary critique comes from Streets of Rogue still being a work in progress. More-or-less weekly patches typically either add major overhauls, items, entirely new sections of the game to progress through, and/or new characters to fool around with. That\u2019s definitely a good thing. What\u2019s less encouraging is that sometimes there isn\u2019t quite a method to the madness. While communication has always been focused upon heavily both ways, there are still a few weak links in the game itself, and the biggest one is how it tries (or fails, really) to explain new mechanics. The first time you run into something new, you are almost definitely going to die or be seriously inconvenienced by it, and the exact usage of a few items isn\u2019t made clear until risky experimentation or seeing somebody else use them well happens before your eyes. If you can tolerate that, it\u2019s definitely worth checking out.", "timestamp_created": 1514171206, "timestamp_updated": 1514210860, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.548872", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38637024": {"recommendationid": "38637024", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994829593", "num_games_owned": 52, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 498, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 498, "last_played": 1514257404}, "language": "english", "review": "you won't find another game like this", "timestamp_created": 1514151104, "timestamp_updated": 1514151104, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38636525": {"recommendationid": "38636525", "author": {"steamid": "76561198402501324", "num_games_owned": 12, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2160, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 606, "last_played": 1513915992}, "language": "english", "review": "Great rogue game!

Very similar to nuclear throne, in the way that it is a single run that you must complete, and there are 20+ different characters to choose from all with different abilities. Fun light-hearted game; I highly recommend it. 8/10\n\nThe game is set in a city that is built vertically where the mayor has taken over. There are many different levels, starting from the slum, to the very top which I think is like the mayor's house and such (I am not sure, I haven't gotten that far yet). You are a part of the resistance, a group fighting for the freedom of the city. When you start, you must fight or sneak your way through each level to progress. You will be given missions on each level, but as far as I can see you don't need to complete them, I believe you just need to make it to the other side and reach the elevator. There are lots of characters to choose from, each offering different starting items, and abilities. The gameplay in streets of rogue is simple but also a lot of fun to play. It isn't very difficult to learn, but I can already see there is a lot of room for you to get better. This game is still in alpha, so we can expect to see lots of more content updates. I would recommend this game to basically anyone, because it offers great singleplay, co-op and multiplayer. $14.99 is a great price for this game, so if it goes on sale, I would diffinitely take it. 8/10", "timestamp_created": 1513999876, "timestamp_updated": 1513999876, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38559173": {"recommendationid": "38559173", "author": {"steamid": "76561198161278151", "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1779, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 235, "last_played": 1514276634}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game, lots of silly fun.", "timestamp_created": 1513999240, "timestamp_updated": 1513999240, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38556846": {"recommendationid": "38556846", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048505628", "num_games_owned": 201, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 242, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 242, "last_played": 1513903415}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game, lots of silly fun.

Your character, whichever one you pick, is on a mission, and it's up to you how you want to complete your mission. I've got 10 hours on record, to give you an idea of how much I've played so far.\n\nYou can hack your way to victory, create numerous zombie apocalypses (very powerful, suprisingly hard to pull off at times), escape your life as a gorilla being kept in a lab and seek your revenge against the scientests who created and tormented you, or just kick it with your gang members. There are way more characters to play than that, but it gives you an idea of some of the options available to you.\n\nThis game is deceptive. You might get a gun and then troll around the place slaying everyone who looks at you funny so you can steal their ham sandwitches, but very very quickly things can go horrificly wrong, and what started off as a simple mugging has now turned into a zone-wide police hunt that you are not gonna win, unless you \"deal with\" every law enforcement officer on the map. xD\n\nI can't wait for this game to be finished. I've enjoyed everything very much, the dev in charge of the game even responded to me bugging him on twitter to say \"I had fun, thanks!\" and I've had about 2 updates since I got the game (which was in the Halloween sale).\n\nI can see so much potential with the game. It's so cyberpunk in places and so unapolagetic about it. ATM I'd say the game is a tiny bit shallow in terms of length, but that's Early Access for you. I've still replayed it quite a lot, and most of the time I don't survive long enough to get to the final zone.

Occasional bugs and crashes are rare, but expected from an unfinished product - we found them to be nearly a non-issue. \n\nAlthough still in early access and in need of development, Streets of Rogue is blessed with an attentive dev and continual updates. \n\nI've had such a blast with my 10+ hours of gameplay, and eagerly await updates.

The player has so much freedom in how to progress in the game.  Essentially there are a few mini objectives to complete in each level, such as destroying a generator, neutralizing a character, or collecting an item.  Naturally there will often be those who get in the way of these objectives to make it harder to complete them.  Now the fun part is determining how to go about accomplishing those objectives; do you use the assassin and cloak yourself and sneak around to backstab people without being caught?  Do you use the doctor to knock somebody out from behind with chloroform?  Do you use the zombie and just infect everyone you see?  You have so many choices on how to go about it, and they also allow you to finish the same objective in numerous different ways, like you can knock on windows to distract or confuse people, turn off power or computers in order to avoid traps, or you can use items or hire people to create diversions.  Choises definitely matter (which is why I nominated it for that category in the Steam Awards for 2017) and make the game so much more fun since it keeps it feeling fresh and new every single time.\n\nAdditionally, the game presents randomization with the levels so the maps will always be different, the objectives will be different, and the things you interact with will be different.  That adds a lot to the replayability of the game.  Multiplayer works well with this game and adds even more depth to it, since players can do their own thing in order to accomplish the goals away from each other or they can team up and utilize their specific class' traits to compliment the abilities of each other.\n\nIt is fantastic that the developer is updating this game frequently and regularly--there is a lot to do already but this is the type of game that can be expanded upon with the new content that gets added.  I can only imagine what sort of new enemies, new player classes, new items, new missions, etc. will be added as time goes on.

The game feels and looks good, even in this development stage there's a decent amount of content. I've just finished a playsession of about 7 hours and the experience was smooth and fun. I particularly like that there's a bunch of different playstyles/perks available in the form of different (unlockable) characters. This offers good replay value and plenty of ways to burn it all down to the gro... I mean *ahem*... experiment... plenty of ways to experiment! There's also a permaprogress system in place so you can gradually unlock more perks/weapons/items and playsettings to use during new runs. Multiplayer seemed to work fine and working together adds more ways to tackle the challenges (or eachother...) as opposed to solo play...\n\nOnly stumbled upon one little bug, sometimes the change appearance menu arrows wouldn't work for me when editing a character, or the item menu wouldn't let me move around in it. Both the menu's were sort of stuck... usually reopening the menu would solve the issue however, once I had to restart the run for it to react again. [spoiler]Also I'm not sure whether not being able to e.g. chloroform people with their backs against the wall was intented, but I noticed there's some npc's that I couldn't reach with the 'magic handkerchief' or similar specials like bloodsucking.[/spoiler]\n\nAnyway, well worth it so far, glad I got it!

This could already be a full game, for a lower price, but I have high hopes, this will be seen to the end.\n\nGraphics:\nSimple, pixely and totally what this game needs. No problems with fps, normal options for monitor resolutions and charming visuals.\n\nGameplay:\nAt the start of each level, you will get several targets you have to fullfill: Neutralize someone, get an item or switch some switches, etc. . For each of these targets you have several options how to do them dependent on the items you have, you can acquire in the level and the character you chose. This creates, for such a seemingly simple game, a great amount of options to get what you want. If you run around as a thief, stealing the living bejeesus out of everyone or become a gorilla, smashing stuff, you will surely find the character fit for you. Unlocking those characters is also not that hard and no problem and will be done without any special currency, only with actions within the game (ex. drink 10 alcoholic beverages in one run for the bartender).\nOn top of this you have permadeath and you unlock new talents and objects through their specially integrated currency \"Chicken Nuggets\". But do not worry, even on failed runs, if you do as much as you can, you get enough to upgrade at least a thing or two. Always do the missions from \"Big M\", a drug dealer. Normal objective, 5 nuggets as reward.\n\nEarlyAccess (Spoilers):\nThis game right now already has so many options but I hope many more will come. Right now the game ends after completing Slums, Industrial, Park and Downtown, I think (4 level types and three levels in each category makes for a total of 12 maps per game and all of those are randomly generated). I only have done it once so forgive me, if I have left out one level type.\nRight now you can see quite clearly the randomly generated nature of the levels with walls without purpose and strange setups for everything. Still, the game is very enjoyable and this does not in any way destroy the way to play the game. You always have a path to your objectives and can always complete them (as far as I know; 10 hours of playing at the time of writing).\n\nVerdict:\nIf you are unsure about EarlyAccess, maybe give this game a go at a discount. I found it highly enjoyable and charming and do not regret buying it.", "timestamp_created": 1511697175, "timestamp_updated": 1511697175, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "37653729": {"recommendationid": "37653729", "author": {"steamid": "76561198181025142", "num_games_owned": 49, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2895, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 217, "last_played": 1513342513}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u975e\u5e38\u4e0a\u763e\u7684\u6e38\u620f", "timestamp_created": 1511695240, "timestamp_updated": 1511695240, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "37646147": {"recommendationid": "37646147", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071207730", "num_games_owned": 76, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 683, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511104709}, "language": "english", "review": "Gorillas, senseless destruction and cyanide pills.\n\nSay no more.", "timestamp_created": 1511691098, "timestamp_updated": 1511691098, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "37644337": {"recommendationid": "37644337", "author": {"steamid": "76561198101069275", "num_games_owned": 90, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 10378, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 243, "last_played": 1514265566}, "language": "english", "review": "good god this is an excellent game", "timestamp_created": 1511690019, "timestamp_updated": 1511690019, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "37637019": {"recommendationid": "37637019", "author": {"steamid": "76561198278014978", "num_games_owned": 96, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1384, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511642069}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u597d\u73a9", "timestamp_created": 1511685606, "timestamp_updated": 1511685606, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "37633148": {"recommendationid": "37633148", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066112106", "num_games_owned": 296, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 1102, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511682716}, "language": "english", "review": "Saw a guy killed himself because i knock on his window\n\n\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1511682952, "timestamp_updated": 1511682952, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "37629491": {"recommendationid": "37629491", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072876199", "num_games_owned": 393, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 902, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511680158}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10", "timestamp_created": 1511680170, "timestamp_updated": 1511680170, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "37629343": {"recommendationid": "37629343", "author": {"steamid": "76561198148905082", "num_games_owned": 173, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2133, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512717745}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Realmente con todo lo que llevo en streets of rogue puedo decir que es facilmente uno de mis juegos favoritos ya que en este juego tengo la libertad de hacer cualquier cosa que se me de la gana, llegando a esclavizar a un zombi para que este muerda a un gorila para luego esclavizar al gorila para que estos terminen asaltando a una persona solamente por que tiene un diente podrido en su bolsillo para asi completar una mision o tambien es posible hackear un refrigerador para que este salga corriendo, tambien es posible terminar en drogas y casi llegar al punto de morir por ellas (No consuman drogas) en otras palabras puedes ser diferentes tipos de personajes, \u00bfte gusta crepusculo?

When you purchase this game and play for the first time, you assume it will be a simple and easy to master game that you'll spend a few hours on and beat. Then, you realize that when you talk to one of many random cpu townspeople, you can hire them to beat up a bouncer and gain entrance to a lab of scientists who each try to kill you as you rush to kill them first, gaining a key in the process, opening the cage of a gorilla, which you then talk to because you are also a gorilla who can talk to people because you gained a gorilla-to-human translating device from flipping three switches in a giant warehouse building in which there are countless traps such as flamethrowers, poisonous gas, and never-ending pits of doom, and you navigate this building of course while swinging a police baton at henchmen trying to kill you, and that you got the police baton by baiting a policeman into a pit of flame. Of course, that was just the first mission out of three per level, with three levels in a floor. And five floors.\n\nSecond of all, this game is goofily fun. And when I say fun, I mean side-splitting, laughing-so-hard-you-cry, rolling-on-floor fun. One of many amazing things you can do with this game is hack a television into running through walls and people, in the process killing a scientist stumbling around the map because your teammate gave him a dizzy spell through the cocaine-and-vodka martini he gave him. This will make you cry because you will just have too much darn fun.\n\nThird of all, IT IS IN EARLY FREAKING ACCESS! This game is amazing, and deserving of every dollar it gets, and it is not even close to finished! This game is my favorite by far, and I encourage any and all to give it a go. Worst case scenario, you feel you lost less than $20. Best case scenario? Absolute fun, for ages to come. \n\n[b] BUY THIS GAME AND SUPPORT IT'S AMAZING CONTENT AND DEVELOPER [/b]", "timestamp_created": 1511393358, "timestamp_updated": 1511393358, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "36849369": {"recommendationid": "36849369", "author": {"steamid": "76561197984018162", "num_games_owned": 492, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1107, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 56, "last_played": 1513854533}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u30e9\u30f3\u30c0\u30e0\u751f\u6210\u3055\u308c\u308b\u5404\u30d5\u30ed\u30a2\u30672\u304b\u30893\u306e\u30df\u30c3\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3092\u3059\u3079\u3066\u3053\u306a\u3057\u3001\u6b21\u306e\u30d5\u30ed\u30a2\u3078\u3069\u3093\u3069\u3093\u9032\u3093\u3067\u3044\u304f\u3068\u3044\u3046\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002\n\u5404\u30d5\u30ed\u30a2\u306b\u306f\u7121\u529b\u5316\u5bfe\u8c61\u3084\u3001\u596a\u9084\u5bfe\u8c61\u3001\u6551\u51fa\u5bfe\u8c61\u306a\u3069\u304c\u304a\u308a\u3001\u4f8b\u3048\u3070\u7121\u529b\u5316\u5bfe\u8c61\u3067\u3042\u308c\u3070\u3001\u7720\u3089\u305b\u3066\u3082\u3044\u3044\u3057\u3001\u902e\u6355\u3057\u3066\u3082\u3044\u3044\u3057\u3001\u3082\u3061\u308d\u3093\u6bb4\u308a\u6bba\u3057\u3066\u3082\u3044\u3044\u3002\n\n\u9078\u3093\u3060\u30ad\u30e3\u30e9\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u306b\u3088\u3063\u3066\u80fd\u529b\u304c\u7570\u306a\u308a\u3001\u4f8b\u3048\u3070\u8b66\u5b98\u306a\u3089NPC\u3092\u902e\u6355\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3057\u3001\u30b3\u30e1\u30c7\u30a3\u30a2\u30f3\u306a\u3089\u5468\u56f2\u3092\u7b11\u308f\u305b\u3066\u4ef2\u9593\u306b\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3002\uff08\u30b8\u30e7\u30fc\u30af\u304c\u6ed1\u308b\u3068\u6575\u5bfe\u3055\u308c\u308b\uff09\n\n\u306a\u304a\u3001\u64cd\u4f5c\u3067\u304d\u308b\u30ad\u30e3\u30e9\u306f\u3001\u7279\u5b9a\u306e\u6761\u4ef6\u3092\u6e80\u305f\u3059\u3053\u3068\u3067\u30a2\u30f3\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u3055\u308c\u308b\u65b9\u5f0f\u3067\u3042\u308a\u3001\u305d\u306e\u7279\u5b9a\u306e\u6761\u4ef6\u306f\u3001\u7279\u5b9a\u306e\u30ad\u30e3\u30e9\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u3058\u3083\u306a\u3044\u3068\u306a\u304b\u306a\u304b\u6e80\u305f\u3059\u306e\u304c\u96e3\u3057\u3044\u3001\u3068\u3044\u3046\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3042\u308b\u306e\u3067\u3001\u5e8f\u76e4\u306f\u30ad\u30e3\u30e9\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u30a2\u30f3\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u306b\u5c02\u5ff5\u3059\u308b\u307b\u3046\u304c\u3044\u3044\u304b\u3082\u3002\n\n1\u30d7\u30ec\u30a410\u5206\uff5e30\u5206\u3067\u3001\u624b\u8efd\u306b\u3042\u305d\u3079\u308b\u306e\u3082\u3088\u3044\uff08\u3082\u3061\u308d\u3093\u9577\u304f\u751f\u5b58\u3067\u304d\u308c\u3070\u3082\u3063\u3068\u6642\u9593\u306f\u4f38\u3073\u308b\u304c\uff09", "timestamp_created": 1511392045, "timestamp_updated": 1511392045, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "36845947": {"recommendationid": "36845947", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999832173", "num_games_owned": 481, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 158, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511391404}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun game its hard", "timestamp_created": 1511391355, "timestamp_updated": 1511391355, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "36845944": {"recommendationid": "36845944", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065472046", "num_games_owned": 103, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 437, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 64, "last_played": 1513201024}, "language": "english", "review": "I payed the full 14.99 for this game.

At times you'll get desynced and combat with other entities totally breaks for a few minutes until you finally resync.  But while that is happening, you can still move around and interact with things so you can totally bypass defenders, circumventing half the gameplay.\n\nThe game also has some rather bad hitching in the performance which happened for both me on my RX480 and my friend on his 1070ti.  If it hitches at a bad time you'll take hits or miss your shots and it is very annoying.  These aren't some bleeding edge graphics here, there is no excuse for that sort of performance issue on this kind of hardware.\n\nThe game isn't all bad though, and if not for these glaring issues I might have enjoyed it more.  The unlocking of percs and customizing your own classes is a nice touch.  The situations that arise in game can be pretty hilarious when big crazy fights break out because you accidentally got caught stealing from some guy.  The game is completely morally ambiguous as well.\n\nIf you are buying this to play split-screen locally, you might not run into some of this.  But I got this to play online co-op specifically but it is just too glitchy at the moment.  I plan to revisit this game down the road and should these issues get ironed out, I'll change my review.\n\nEdit:\nBased on dev response below, gonna give the game the benefit of the doubt and give it a thumbs up.", "timestamp_created": 1511390817, "timestamp_updated": 1512088689, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543113", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1511401479, "developer_response": "If the issue stated in your first paragraph occurs, please post an output log, as I am actively looking for a fix (if it's the issue I'm thinking of):\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/512900/discussions/0/1458455461472158877/\n\nCan you descibe the issue in more detail?  Are you able to hit enemies and vice versa, or are they just frozen in place?  If it's the latter, this is the result of a bad connection, and there's unfortunately not much I can do about that directly.  You might want to check into your firewall or router settings, or those of the person you're playing with.  But if all else fails, you could look into the programs Hamachi or Evolve as a means of starting up a LAN game with players in different locations.\n\nRegarding hitching in performance - Can you describe in more detail what would constitute a hitch in this case?  This game is using a standard Unity configuration, and a large amount of optimization has been done already.  You may want to check into the programs you have running in the background, as this is likely the result of an issue external to the game.

The city is appropriately separated into socioeconomic statuses and you must go through the slums all the way up to the 1%ers to kill the mayor.\n\nThe combat is an addictive balance of melee, guns and stealth, although I can't help but feel like the Soldier is the best character I've got so far. The Doctor was great for unlocking the Assassin, because I was able to chlorophorm everyone without detection, and the Gorilla was great for unlocking the wrestler because his dash attack still counts as using only your fist, but neither of those characters are able to use weapons (and the gorilla isn't even allowed in stores for hillariously obvious reasons). The Assassin's sword runs out of durability way too fast so you pretty much have to secure another weapon before it breaks, which is a drag. The Soldier however, has a helmet, guns, mines, grenades, and door demolishers. I'm working on unlockin the other chacters, but as it stands Soldier is mostly who I want too play, and the immbalance is worth mentioning; athough the gorilla is a strong second pick because give him a melee weapon and he can dash to one hit kill most things.  \n\nSo far it feels a bit easier than Nuclear Throne, as I die a somewhat often to Big Bandit on floor one of NT, where as there was no boss at the last floor of the slums in this game. I would appreciate if I had to kill King Hobo to get out of the slums or something. It would make sense that the mayor employs the filthiest hobo to keep the slums down on their luck.\n\nAlso, it may be lost in the wall of settings text, but this game doesn't appear to have a mouse senistivty slider, and I had to go into my PC's mouse settings to adjusts, but hey thats an Early Access game for you. \n\nOverall this game feels way more polished than a lot of early access games, and I gotta give props to the one guy developing it because he seems pretty responsive to the community, but more importantly he seems to have created a game that one person can manage. I see way to many tiny dev teams get swamped in what they want to accomplish. \n\n\nPros:\n*Addictive Gameplay \n*Nostalgic Graphics \n*Sweet sweet 80's 8bit techno song as a background to your slaughter \n*Unlockables are worth unlocking and unlocked with chicken nuggets  (I really hope this is a nod to the game Kindergarten) \n*No bugs/crashes so far\n*Mutator adds fun game changing options with minimal penalties. \n\nCons:\n*Character Immbalance (possibly only an early game issue)\n*Too many characters cant us guns (I think it would make more sense to bar the Doctor (and other classes) from most weapons, but not all. Let the Doc use a pistoles and maybe like a scapel. The hippocratic oath doesn't apply to people who ARENT your patients and you can still beat the crap out of people with yer fists, so The Doc's logic is already inconsistant.)\n*No? sentivity options for the mouse (either that or it's kinda hard to find and I'm being lazy X)\n\nSuggestions:\n*Increase durability of \"Assassin's Sword\" aka unique starting sword for Assassin. \n*Bar some characters from certain weapon TYPES instead of all weapons (no melee or no guns not specific enough IMO).\n*WHERE MY B SKINS AT??? \n*More hair/beard options plz\n*MORE BOSSES!!!!!!!\n\n\nSo the final question is, is this game worth $15 USD? I would say if you feel like Nuclear Throne is worth the price, you will find this game to be worth the price too. Though slighty easier in the beginning levels, I would say this game is worth it because it has more depth packed into the gameplay and because I see my issues with the game being adressed sooner rather than later, even if only by a similar modding community to the one that found NT. \n\n\nPRO TIP: Soldier is best when he looks like Mr. T (Mr T B skin for soldier PLEEAAAASEEEEEE)", "timestamp_created": 1510877620, "timestamp_updated": 1510878045, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "36560131": {"recommendationid": "36560131", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048402951", "num_games_owned": 167, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1223, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511302670}, "language": "english", "review": "This last update was the first one I've experienced since buying the game, and it reset all of my unlocks.

Yes the developer is dedicated, yes there's an okay amount of content, but it exploits the grind aspect to say there's more content than there really is. Pixel graphics, a weak soundtrack, and some clever ideas aren't enough for that price tag. \n\n- Half the characters are great, the other half are just kind of whatever. Some characters like the Hacker just feel very, very, very useless and uninteractive. \n\n- VERY few NPC's. 30 minutes in you've seen every one of them and you basically already know what they all do.\n\n- The inventory / HUD feels a bit clunky or ugly. Could be polished a bit and cleaned up. \n\n- Not a whole lot of clever or sneaky interactions that you can find that aren't pretty obvious already.\n\n- The maps are pretty boring. Very few things to interact with and once you've played a run or two you'll see nothing new from then on. \n\n- The game takes a while to play through a run and a LOT of the run feels grindy before it gets interesting and possibly a bit difficult. \n\n- Buying items doesn't feel very rewarding or useful. I kept finding that unless I needed that one clutch heal, then I was never, ever, ever using the item machines or shops. \n\n- MOST items feel pretty pointless. A lot of the time you can get through a game solely by shooting your way through or using your fists without the need for any other items aside from food (healing).\n\n- So many interactions either feel wonky or just flat out don't make sense. It doesn't feel as polished as it could be. Characters act uncharacteristically sometimes out of nowhere and there isn't a sense of.. \"my gameplay sparks x reaction from characters.\" It's just alerting an enemy versus not alerting an enemy. \n\n- Rewards and purchases with the currency feel.. wonky. Currency takes a while to get and most rewards feel too insignificant for you to want to buy or grind to buy. A lot of them you actually DON'T want to buy because it makes gameplay more inefficient with the way leveling up is designed. They don't offer interesting enough gameplay changes. \n\n- The game isn't challenging unless YOU place some kind of challenge there for yourself, which basically means every run is some kind of Nuzlocke run. You're just looking for excuses to do things in certain ways. \n\n- The game was made under the premise that you could play it however you want. That being said, the only method that makes sense is to go in guns blazing because you're still basically doing the same thing as the other methods. You want to hack that computer and have an edge in that regard with the Hacker? Doesn't matter, because computers are too easy to access, too easy to use, and you're left with no niche, purpose, or edge over any other character. They can do the same thing as you just as easily. Computers and certain things should've been made more difficult for the average character to access to give certain characters distinct niches. Right now they can all do the same thing as one another with ease (except for characters with special abilities).", "timestamp_created": 1509335667, "timestamp_updated": 1509337807, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.603358", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "36125628": {"recommendationid": "36125628", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019958111", "num_games_owned": 245, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 589, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509720005}, "language": "english", "review": "Got beaten to death by ghosts\nin a public toilet\n10/10 would die again", "timestamp_created": 1509315804, "timestamp_updated": 1509315804, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "36122584": {"recommendationid": "36122584", "author": {"steamid": "76561198330945313", "num_games_owned": 61, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 839, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 9, "last_played": 1513565619}, "language": "spanish", "review": "esta chido para hacer un cagadero en el mapa", "timestamp_created": 1509307476, "timestamp_updated": 1509307476, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "36119114": {"recommendationid": "36119114", "author": {"steamid": "76561198372842723", "num_games_owned": 13, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2626, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512536850}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is pretty dank.

I normally can't stick with a game for more than a few hours before I start finding it boring, but I've unlocked every character, item and ability, and I'm still coming back to this game all the time thanks to the excellent create-a-class system. I don't normally write reviews, but I honestly lie awake some nights worrying that people don't understand that Streets of Rogue is a seriously awesome game. So let me tell you: Streets of Rogue? Seriously awesome game. You heard it here first. So sit down, buckle in, and crack open a boy with your cold ones whilst I explain to you /in detail/ exactly why and how damn much I reccomend this game on steam.\n\n---\n\nPlenty of games have tried to simplify the rogue-like genre to varying degrees of success, but I think the best way to understand SoR is as a procedurally generated immersive sim. The game handles combat, item hoarding and leveling up characters perfectly well, but the true beauty is the playground you're given to play in. The first few times I played, I died consistantly within the first three levels because I was running around at full pelt punching slum dwellers, scientists, doors, fridges, and anything else that I suspected might drop an item if I could only punch it the right way. Slowing down, I realised there are so many more interesting ways to play. For item collection quests, you don't have to kick the door down and punch the item out of it's holders' still-warm corpse. You can knock politely, offer the guy an item to trade, and be on your merry way. Or visit a drug dealer, spike his air-conditioning with a random drug and see what happens. Might poison him, might turn him invisible. Is he in a gang? Pick a fight with a rival gang, and lead them to him. Is he in a hideout? Find a hacker, pickpocket his hacking tool, and use it to set off poison gas and trap doors in his base. Half an hour in, you'll realise how fun it is to pick a class and take it's unique abilities for a spin to see just how many different ways you can skin a gun-toting cat guarding the item you need to exit the level and escape the unkillable robot death machine slowly stalking you across the map.\n\nEven in beta, I still haven't seen all the games content- in part because of how balls-hard it can be, and in part because its so much fun just to screw around trying new characters or ideas out. Half of my runs end with me hitting exit, because I've just seen something happen that gave me an idea for an awesome new character build I had to make RIGHT NOW. Holy shit, fire spreads in this game?? Hold up, let me roll an arsonist class with a flamethrower, and oil barrel and a lighter. Secret Agent that mixes cyonide into drinks and loads a water pistol with rage inducing chemicals? Check. Player-made gang that gains a new member each level, but is attacked on sight by rival gangs? Checkion rings. Ancient vampire that's strong enough to punch a dude through an entire building's worth of walls, but can only heal by drinking blood? You get the idea- there's like, a ton of different ways to play the base game, and with the create-a-class mode, you can basically play however you want to. There are a few limitations with how creative you can get, but by and large, I've been able to make every character I've wanted to so far. PROTIP: Grab a buddy, turn on rogue-vision mode, and play co-op as the police officer class. You're basically playing a top-down S.W.A.T sequal.\n\nAt the moment, my only gripes are with a select few abilities or items that aren't fully explored and feel a bit useless. For example, you can play as a doctor that gets extra bang for his buck with medical items... all one of them. And I often go entire runs without encountering a med kit at all. The game features an awesome firespreading mechanic that takes into account flammable objects and oil spills- but its impossible to use oil to set anything on fire, as it can only be poured into empty spaces. There are a few cases like this where the game features content that isn't being used to its fullest- but unlike many beta/early access titles, they are small issues that I can absolutely see being addressed in future patches. The dev even has a form built into the pause menu so you can hit him up with suggestions and feedback the moment they pop into your head- and from what I've seen, these ideas genuinely get taken into account and often find their way into the bi-weekly update patches. The only other problem I have with the game is that there isn't more of it to go around- but with placeholders in the current version for character-specific missions, player-created gameplay mutators and more, I can see that changing very soon. \n\nOne criticism that tends to crop up in negative reviews is the lack of mission variety leading to repetitive gameplay. To an extent, this is true. You'll be given the same 3-4 mission types over and over again. Kill these guys, get this item, hit these switches, ad infinitum. But ultimately, if you are having repetitive playthroughs, it's because you keep doing the same thing every time. There is a ton of options at your disposal, and the game does a good job of rewarding (or necessitating) a varied approach to challenges. Limited ammo cappacity and frequent item rewards mean your best chance of survival will likely involve a few different gadgets, and you are rewarded bonus XP for pulling off missions without guns, weapons, or alarms. Ultimately, this is a psychological difference between forcing you to mix up your gameplay, and allowing you to. In the Splinter Cell games, each mission is mixed up with different requirements- use these weapons, trigger no alarms, complete the mission in this time limit. But at the end of the day, what are you doing every single time? Killing those dudes, grabbing those maguffins and hitting those switches, with varying degrees of flavour text thrown on top. Chosing not to do this in SoR is a design choice that leaves the creativity up to the player, not the developer. The game isn't going to tell you \"Kill this guy with cunfusion gas, trigger no alarms\". But you WILL find yourself with a vial of confusion gas in your pocket, tasked with killing a guy surrounded by fire pits and meat churners, and you can bet you'll get a bonus reward for killing him without weapons and without triggering alarms. \n\nAs it stands, I'd reccomend this game to just about anyone who can enjoy being left to make their own fun in sandbox games. It's a ton of fun in single player. It's awesome with a bud. It'll take you a long time to unlock everything. You'll have a lot of fun screwing about in the process. If the developer keeps to his plan of adding a ton more mission variety, more items and abilities, more characters and more interactions between all of these elements, this could easily be something I consider a masterpiece.\n\nTL;DR:\nIf you the type of guy that boots up GTA SA, runs in the complete opposite direction of the mission marker and starts practicing safely landing airliners, this game is probably your jam.

A comedian telling jokes can get the owner of a locked door and safe to just give up their key to you, although I went into a room with some thugs who didn't like my humour when I told my joke and immediately killed me, so the jokes don't always go down that well.  But then playing a vampire where I have to drink the blood of innocents and making sure no-one else sees me doing it changes everything - and playing a zombie that everyone runs from or tries to kill and you need to get a zombie infection going on each level is yet another different experience.  Then add into that some random 'events' - the two I have come across so far are a radiation leak each 20 seconds that hurts people outdoors (which you can use to your advantage, but which has you scurrying from building to building) and a killer robot slowly chasing you whose missiles it shoots at you really hurt - but again can be used as an advantage to help you blow walls down.\n\nMy only request at this point is to allow characters to be upgraded.  There is an unlock system that lets you unlock new random inter-level rewards - but for casual players such as myself I would stick to the game longer if I can grind my character's stats higher and other improvements (such as improving special ability through upgrade tree).  There is a way to pay for starting items, but I don't like spending upgrade currency on single use items - I would rather grind permanent items (starting from weak and slowly upgrading to stronger) than just buying single use powerful items.\n\nOverall this doesn't feel like an Early Access Game, it feels like a completed game.

This is the kind of situation it's meant for: a small developer whose game already has a great foundation on which to stand, but room to grow, and who who wants the gaming community to help grow the game.\n\n[b]Bottom line, up front:[/b] This game is unfinished but [i]fun![/i]\n\nAs of writing this review, I've unlocked all the characters and played through all the levels available to me (3 levels with 3 floors each), but I still want to keep playing the game because of how much fun it is!  I still have to unlock all of the quest rewards and character traits, which you purchase with earning chicken nuggets, earned by leveling up, beating floors, or completing side missions.\n\nSo why do I think this game is so much fun?  This is such a subjective questions, and I'm not the best game reviewer so I'm not entirely sure myself but I'll try to break it down:\n\n[list]\n[*][b]This game is hilarious.[/b]  It's not funny in the sense that the writing is funny or there is sharp wit present in the game.  Its all in the situations you are put in or create yourself.  The core gameplay sets you up for some serious hijinks which can create some rather amusing moments.  For example, figuring out that the slavemaster can turn any character into a human hand grenade was one of my favorite discoveries.\n\n[*][b]This game is accessible.[/b]  My wife is not an avid gamer by any means (i.e. spends most of her time on idling tablet games) but she loves this game.  And because she doesn't always have the best reaction time or aiming ability, we have to adapt our strategy.\n\n[*][b]This game is dynamic.[/b]  It's not really the randomly generated levels and missions that create a dynamic experience (although it is a quintessential element to roguelikes).  The wildly different characters with their unbalanced (in a good way) traits can really affect how you experience and play the game.  The vast and crazy arsenal of items also allows for some creativity in approaching how you complete different missions.\n\n[*][b]This game moves at your tempo.[/b]  You can complete the levels as fast or slow as you want.  You can be thorough or you can be efficient.  You can be neat or you can be sloppy.  Streets of Rogue gives you the power to experience the game however you want, which I think might be it's strongest quality.\n\n[*][b]This game is satisfying.[/b]  Beating the missions and levels is satisfying.  Discovering a new mechanic that allows for a different approach is satisfying.  Pulling off a plan that you weren't sure was going to work is satisfying.  Slamming a goon through a wall so you can get 5 gold from a treasure chest is satisfying.  Going around and gimping every slum dweller on the floor with a baseball bat is satisfying.  It's just full of wholesome experiences all around.\n\n[*][b]This game offers challenge without frustration.[/b]  I do like roguelikes, but sometimes they can really feel like a merciless grind.  Streets of Rogue is really a refreshing roguelike experience.  Although I have died plenty of times, meaning that I have to start the game over, I was always just eager to start over again rather than mad or flustered.\n[/list]\n\nAnyways, what I'm trying to say is that Streets of Rogue definitely provides $15 worth of fun, so this is an Early Access title I can strongly recommend.  And the developer (jut one guy!) engages with the community, is transparent and reasonable with his goals, and has made one seriously awesome game.

The developer\nBest developer ever, super active, always takes suggestions from the community, fast bug fixes, etc. Pretty much the perfect developer!\n2. The sheer amount of options, you can choose from a diverse cast of 23 characters, these characters range from an angry gorilla who bashes his way through levels with ease, to a shapeshifter who can sneakily jump in and out of npc's bodies.\n3.

It has numerous qualities of a sandbox where I can stay behind on the levels and destroy whatever it is I may. Each class, besides the most blatantly bland ones like the hobo or the criminal (for neither of which do I have respect) has a uniqueness to it that stands out among most. The mission system and overall gameplay seem to have a rather simple level difficulty which further supports my opinion of it as a sandbox-like with the progression-style gameplay being the only part of it that seems to directly contradict that genre placement. Please do bear in mind that this game is much more entertaining with friends that also directly contradict that genre placement by making the game extremely difficult to progress through as each and every one of them seems to want to beat my character's corpse until he's just a bloody mass. All in all, I promote a creative individual to this game in order to make with the early access label as they can. I now only play this game when there is a friend over as to have another person to assist me in my individual manner of creativity: how many people can you pile up at the minecart tracks at once to feed the beast?", "timestamp_created": 1505626222, "timestamp_updated": 1505626222, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "35014352": {"recommendationid": "35014352", "author": {"steamid": "76561198305137867", "num_games_owned": 30, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1632, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 183, "last_played": 1513512967}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8fd9\u6e38\u620f\u53ef\u73a9\u6027\u6781\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u4e5f\u5728\u52aa\u529b\u66f4\u65b0\u4e2d\uff0c\u5185\u5bb9\u975e\u5e38\u591a\uff0c\u4eba\u7269\u4e5f\u5f88\u591a\uff0c\u5224\u5b9a\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e5f\u8fd8\u5408\u7406\uff0c\u662f\u4e00\u6b3e\u5f88\u6709\u53d1\u5c55\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u5750\u7740\u7b49\u4f5c\u8005\u66f4\u65b0233\uff0c\u987a\u5e26\u4e00\u63d0.................\u8b66\u5bdf\u600e\u4e48\u89e3\u9501\u554a\uff01\uff01\uff01\uff01\uff01\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1505624175, "timestamp_updated": 1505624175, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "35011905": {"recommendationid": "35011905", "author": {"steamid": "76561198173395817", "num_games_owned": 1267, "num_reviews": 97, "playtime_forever": 751, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505624957}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "[h1]Pancadaria com e nos amigos![/h1]\n\n[b]IMPORTANTE:[/b] Atualiza\u00e7\u00f5es ao jogo citadas na review, a partir da vers\u00e3o [b]alpha 33d[/b], estar\u00e3o somente em coment\u00e1rios, caso o jogo receba grandes mudan\u00e7as, como a sa\u00edda do Early Access, por exemplo. Por\u00e9m, avisarei quanto a isso na review.\n\n[b]EDI\u00c7\u00d5ES:[/b] Nenhuma atualiza\u00e7\u00e3o do jogo citada [b]nos coment\u00e1rios[/b] - [b]16/09/2017[/b].\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Em desenvolvimento por [url=https://twitter.com/madguy90]Matt Dabrowski[/url] e distribu\u00eddo pela [url=http://store.steampowered.com/search/?publisher=tinyBuild]tinyBuild[/url], [i]Streets of Rogue[/i] \u00e9 um jogo do g\u00eanero [b]Roguelike[/b] com [b]elementos de RPG[/b] e que tem como foco a divers\u00e3o com amigos, sendo totalmente confuso e engra\u00e7ado. Al\u00e9m de que ainda est\u00e1 em desenvolvimento por uma \u00fanica pessoa - a citada inicialmente na review. Lan\u00e7ado no come\u00e7o do ano, [b]10/03/2017[/b], meu primeiro contato com ele foi em um final de semana gratuito juntamente com um amigo, tanto que jogamos at\u00e9 o dia amanhecer no domingo. A data de quando rolou esse fim de semana, j\u00e1 n\u00e3o sei. Mas posso dizer que foi decisivo para eu poder compr\u00e1-lo.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sua ideia \u00e9 bem simples, e como citei no come\u00e7o, foca muito na divers\u00e3o com seus amigos, sendo na casualidade, tamb\u00e9m. Como est\u00e1 em [b]Early Access[/b], ainda falta ter um final, pois o prop\u00f3sito j\u00e1 existe, por si s\u00f3. N\u00e3o irei entrar em detalhes quanto \u00e0 sua hist\u00f3ria, pois ela nem sequer \u00e9 o foco do jogo, mas existe, caso algu\u00e9m tenha d\u00favidas. Para que a divers\u00e3o ocorra, o jogo nos proporciona uma bagun\u00e7a imensur\u00e1vel na qual voc\u00ea juntamente de seus amigos acabam rindo e se perdendo com tudo aquilo que ocorre no n\u00edvel (dungeon). Por isso, eu [b]recomendo somente se for jogado com amigos[/b]. De prefer\u00eancia, via voip ou no mesmo local, algo que torna muito mais comunicativo e prop\u00edcio a risos.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Atualmente, na vers\u00e3o [b]Alpha 33d[/b], o jogo cont\u00e9m 3 lugares divididos em 3 n\u00edveis cada um, por\u00e9m, podendo ser em 2 \u00e0s vezes. S\u00e3o 23 personagens ao todo e muito bem bolados e com habilidades especiais, fora as iniciais e as que ser\u00e3o desbloqueadas a cada level up. Por exemplo, um ladr\u00e3o tem a habilidade de furtar algu\u00e9m tranquilamente. Em alguns casos, hehe. Outro \u00e9 o canibal... Com sua habilidade especial de comer os cad\u00e1veres para recuperar vida \u00e9 simplesmente a minha favorita! Lembrando que voc\u00ea pode personalizar at\u00e9 8 personagens a seu gosto. Voc\u00ea personaliza todas as habilidades. Todos os personagens t\u00eam at\u00e9 8 habilidades iniciais, tirando a [b]especial[/b]. Caso voc\u00ea crie um personagem e exagere, o deixando muito apelativo, voc\u00ea n\u00e3o poder\u00e1 desbloquear conquistas e personagens, assim como habilidades. H\u00e1 um limite. \u00c9 algo bem bacana. Mais habilidades s\u00e3o destravadas a sua escolha somente quando voc\u00ea sobe de level durante a sua aventura sozinho ou com amigos, ap\u00f3s completar miss\u00f5es para que possa avan\u00e7ar aos pr\u00f3ximos n\u00edveis, dependendo do quanto de XP tenha ganho. Tamb\u00e9m ser\u00e3o destravadas na sua base (algo que vai entender quando jogar). A variedade de personagens \u00e9 extensa e sempre aparece um novo \u00e0 cole\u00e7\u00e3o. N\u00e3o se preocupe quanto a isso.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Os gr\u00e1ficos s\u00e3o pixelados, mas perfeitamente detalhados \u00e0 sua proposta. Todas as ambienta\u00e7\u00f5es s\u00e3o bem feitas e deixam os cen\u00e1rios bem variados, passando a real situa\u00e7\u00e3o do lugar: um caos. O jogo \u00e9 leve e n\u00e3o apresenta problemas de performa mas, por outro lado, apresenta bugs com os cen\u00e1rios. Isso n\u00e3o ocorre sempre, mas s\u00e3o bugs divertidos, pois os inimigos se enfiam dentro de paredes e isso \u00e9 bacana. N\u00e3o atrapalha o avan\u00e7o com o jogo, mas lhe d\u00e1 risadas. \u00c9 divertido. Sua trilha de fundo e efeitos sonoros s\u00e3o formid\u00e1veis para a premissa do jogo. Ah, antes que eu esque\u00e7a: Suas conquistas s\u00e3o tranquilas, basta se divertir com o jogo!\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0[b]H\u00e1 tradu\u00e7\u00e3o ao Portugu\u00eas Brasileiro em 80% do conte\u00fado[/b]. Isso se d\u00e1 por estar em Early Access, \u00e9 claro. Aos poucos, deve sair atualiza\u00e7\u00f5es quanto a isso. Cont\u00e9m erros em alguns casos, mas \u00e9 perfeitamente aceit\u00e1vel. Eu n\u00e3o sei se algu\u00e9m est\u00e1 sendo pago para traduzir ou se \u00e9 algo volunt\u00e1rio, visto que a tradu\u00e7\u00e3o n\u00e3o \u00e9 feita pela Oficina Steam, ent\u00e3o, caso n\u00e3o entenda ingl\u00eas e tenha receio quanto ao jogo por conta disso, bem, n\u00e3o se preocupe. Nem se n\u00e3o tivesse tradu\u00e7\u00e3o tornaria o jogo n\u00e3o recomendado aos brasileiros que n\u00e3o entendem muito bem ou nada de ingl\u00eas.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As jogatinas em coop podem ser feitas localmente, isto \u00e9, no mesmo computador com at\u00e9 4 jogadores ou 4 jogadores jogando em LAN. O mesmo ocorre se for jogar online criando uma sala privada ou aberta a mais jogadores. N\u00e3o cheguei a ter problemas de conex\u00f5es, exceto quando a internet ficava um lixo ou estava em uso. Sua conex\u00e3o ser\u00e1 peer-to-peer. Se algu\u00e9m estiver com problemas de conex\u00e3o, afeta todo mundo (n\u00e3o de maneira extrema). Mas n\u00e3o \u00e9 um problema, afinal, \u00e9 compreens\u00edvel um jogo deste tipo ter uma conex\u00e3o assim, certo? Servidores seriam uma boa, mas gerariam custos. Entenda.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Talvez voc\u00ea nunca tenha ouvido falar do jogo. Entendo isso. Nem eu conhecia, mas foi um final de semana que mudou tudo isso e um amigo me falar sobre o jogo. Testamos e gostamos. [b]TALVEZ[/b] o jogo entre em outro final de semana gratuito. Seria uma boa. Mas n\u00e3o posso dar certeza quanto a isso. O que posso dar certeza \u00e9 que vale a pena com seu pre\u00e7o atual, caso tenha levado em conta o que falei no come\u00e7o de tudo: jogar com amigos. Do contr\u00e1rio, n\u00e3o valeria a pena compr\u00e1-lo. A convers\u00e3o do jogo \u00e9 justa, tendo sua base em US$ 14,99 e convertidos em R$ 27,99. O desenvolvedor avisa que, quando o jogo sair do seu acesso antecipado, provavelmente manter\u00e1 seu pre\u00e7o, por\u00e9m, pode ser alterado. Talvez suba aos R$ 36,99, tendo base em US$ 20,00. [b]Eu recomendo esperar por promo\u00e7\u00f5es[/b]. S\u00e3o sempre bem-vindas e eu sempre recomendo-as. Por que a pressa, certo? Neste per\u00edodo de espera, que tal avisar os amigos e comprar o jogo com eles depois, hein?! Ent\u00e3o, fa\u00e7a isso! Suporte-o quando poss\u00edvel. Fico feliz que j\u00e1 tenha vendido cerca de 140k de c\u00f3pias mas, da minha Steam, somente 6 amigos t\u00eam o jogo hoje (16/09/2017).

But on top of that: randomly generated missions!  Streets of Rogue's random missions, most of which are of the infiltration-ey variety, combine with the generated urban settings to provide you with endless unique challenges, many of which give the modest and not overdone stealth mechanics a reason to exist.  I don't know if the random missions each level idea is original to this game, but it works amazingly well.  It's like taking the emergent complexity of a procedural dungeon crawl and squaring it.  I hope that many roguelite and roguelike developers shamelessly yoink this formula.\n\nThe game itself is somewhat of a mid length demo at this point, with the developer prioritizing a lot of core gameplay and engine functionality over making all the levels the game will eventually have.  I support this, because the foundation being built is rock solid, and I see even more awesomeness in this game's future building upon that.  If we ever get modding, be still my heart.\n\nIn any case, you'll have to get a fair bit of practice at the game before you can even notice that it's not complete.  Just getting through the first three sets of levels was hard before I had some solid strategies down, but definitely fun-hard. \n There are great amounts of fun to be had from this game today.  The network co-op gameplay is great fun, though some sync issues are still being worked on, and the local co-op is too, with the ability to switch between split screen and single screen depending on how far apart you are.  It could be a bit better done... see SMBX for a stellar example... but it's still quite good.  And on top of being among a small elite group of stellar endlessly fun co-op games with both split screen and lan support, it's quite addictively fun to play all by myself as well.

(RIP)\nIt doesn't contain the elements of endless gameplay and leveling up your character into a god (Hopefully it will), but it has quirks and many ways to complete a quest. The replayablity of this game is so far only limited to character unlocks along with some unlockable traits and rewards for quests. Since it is still in dev, I respect that, as the game isn't finished and the dev most likely wants to hear feedback.\n\nGood thing about character unlocks though is that it opens a whole new way to play the game. Such as playing with the gorilla you can tear through an entire level with your bare hands and not have to care to much about your character's weaknesses. Play as a hacker and you sneak around hacking computers making it so a person falls victim to their own traps. Play as a shapeshifter and completely abuse the ability to take someone over and use their abilities to accomplish your goals. Either way if you like to have several options on how to approach a task this is a fitting game.\n\nDo I recommend the game?\n\nYes, I do. Despite only having 10 hours (as of writing this) I plan on having more. I was looking for something a little different than the array of cliche games on Steam (FPS, shitty survival, and clones of other games) and this fufilled that need. If you plan on playing by yourself I would be a little bit more wary of this purchase, but if you plan on playing with people it multiples the fun.

even start?\n\nThe game itself is MASSIVELY REPLAYABLE, no two runs feel quite the exact same (even if you're traversing the same area, there's a bunch of randomly generated missions and structures to keep you entertained)\nI frequently run through every nook and cranny of a level, causing as much chaos as possible, or gathering supplies through more subtle means. (By 'subtle,' I obviously mean electrocuting someone then snapping an explosive slave collar to their neck)\n\nLet me just take a moment to describe SOME of the things you can do in this game.\nYou can hack most electronics, and make them do damn near whatever you please, including making fridges run!\nYou can cause a zombie apocalypse and feed on the flesh of your enemies to heal your wounds.\nYou can drug people with practically every status ailment in multiple ways (such as mixing it into a drink) and even chloroform them!\nYou could also play as a shapeshifter capable of possessing someone, shooting their friend, then running away as a firefight breaks out.\n(Not to mention being able to create living suicide bombs forced to do your bidding)\n\nEVERY class is viable in this game, as each one holds at least one unique trait that completely changes their playing style.   \n\nOh, and by the way? All of the NPCs have their own unique behaviors that follow the logic of their classes (albeit with about a third of the health they normally do, in order to keep you from being overpowered by just one of them) so it's all fair grounds for fights!

Alone and with friends and I just can't find what is fun about this game. \nSo why can't I seem to have fun with this game?\n- The inhabitants of the floor appear to have lives but are plain\n- Nothing seems to have weight what you do\n- The police only does something when they seen you do it. They don't really care that much if something was blown up and they don't see you do it.\n- While advancing the floor is something that you constantly do and sometimes have to actually try a bit harder to do(if you wanna do everything properly in the not easiest way)\n- The world doesn't grab me at all. I don't feel like I care about anything in this world.\n\nOverall I am just not interested in this game and I tried it several times but got bored after a few floors.\nIf you just wanna crawl through a faceless world with a faceless character and have the ability to approach missions in a lot of different ways.

It just feels very similar to Nuclear Throne, in a good way. But this game uses a quest system instead of killing everything in order to progress. These quests can be very difficult especially depending on the character you choose. So basically if you choose the gorilla, you will be unable to complete certain quests until you get a translator.

I didn't think I'd like it, solely because of the grating humor, but the mechanics are superb. Each class plays completely differently, and the long, LONG list of traits and items makes every run different. It's structured well:\n\n1. Your class defines your overall play style, and how you approach goals (nonlethal, enslavement, crew tactics, tools, etc.)\n  -You need to break into a man's home and take something from him\n     -As a cop, you could enter and arrest him\n     -As a hacker, you could blow a hole in his wall by remotely detonating his TV, killing him in the process\n     -As a slave master, you could order three slaves to break down his door and maul him\n     -As a doctor, you could knock, sneak in, and knock him out\n     -As a bartender, you could give him free drinks and convince him to give you the item\n     -As a comedian, you could tell him jokes (The derpa derp derp shit is annoying, though. Ecksdee) then take it\n     -You get the idea. Classes all have different tools to get things done. \n2. Traits and rewards encourage experimentation during runs\n     -Rewards and level-up-traits are randomized, so you'll find different aids each run\n  -Back to the man and his item\n     -If you found a shrinking tablet, you could poison his drink as a bartender, leave, wait, then laugh as his wife \n       unkowingly stomps him to death\n     -If you found a time bomb, you could destroy him and his entire house\n     -If you found a window cutter, you could sneak into another part of his house, disable security, and put him down easy\n3. Disasters occur every 3rd level, shaking everything up\n     -If bombs are falling, you could just wait around for the inevitable explosion somewhere in or around his house\n     -If death-robot is following you, you could trick it into killing him accidentally, then swoop in and get the item\n4. Outside all those, there are also mutators. They're self-imposed, but they keep things interesting and fun\n\nFor an early access game, it doesn't feel early access. Each feature is well-polished, and (by design) there's plenty to do. I'm 13 hours in, but there's still PLENTY to do. In fact, I just finished a 51 minute run as Doctor. I always thought she was garbage, but I made her work, and spent almost an hour messing around on her-- An hour long run, on a character I previously disliked. It's wild. Time's another thing, while I'm on it. It's designed simply, so you can pick up and play for 5 minutes, but there's also enough depth and variation to play for hours. It's genius. \n\nJust as well, small but important points:\n1. It's very stable, and well optimized. I've never crashed, and I keep 60fps. This game is early access, and I'm on a toaster, so those are surprising and appreciated.\n2. It has 4-player co-op. Multiply everything above by 4. Building heist crews, vampire clans, cannibal cults, is all fun and well done. \n\nI have almost no complaints. The AI can be a bit odd, at times (their awareness/aggro is shaky sometimes, especially in co-op), but it functions well. That's really it. \n\nThis game was such a surprise. I expected an unfunny, annoying, indie trash heap. instead, I got an unfunny, absorbing, deep (yes, really), dynamic (yes again), rogue-lite-like-RPG-shooter-stealth-sim-thing masterpiece, with loads of replay value. It's the best $15 I've spent on Steam, bar none. \n\nAND MORE IS COMING, GOODNESS GRACIOUS. WE ALREADY HAVE TONS, BUT SO MUCH MORE IS ON THE WAY. Regular updates, new characters and items added frequently, character creation, etc. \n\n10/10, no exaggeration.

It's definitely a game with a few interesting ideas and fans of roguelite games will definitely get some enjoyment out of it. What is in it is well tested, well polished and with only minor bugs (if any).\n\nI have a few problems with the game though : \n\nThe replayability factor slowly fades away. There's simply very little character development. There are a lot of options but no growth, other than the levels and the perks. Some class exclusive perks would definitely help in this department. Maybe some talents. Hell, something to make each playtrough feel unique.\n\nThe multiplayer worked well enough for me at the start but nowadays I can connect to someone once in a blue moon. I guess it's down to luck.\n\nI'm sure the game will get better with time but I'm kind of burned out of it due to multiplayer frustrations and very little playtrough varation. $15 for 24 hours of enjoyment is a fair trade, so here's my recommendation.\n\n=====================================\n\nLater edit : I tried the newest update and zombies are a step in the right direction!",

Bought it for half price during Steam Summer Sale, and I honestly would have bought it for double had I known what it was.\n\nEven in the Alpha, there is a ton of freedom in the way you can go about things. It isn't the most amount of content you'll ever see, but the combinations of items, class abilities and such make for great replay value. And with more stuff on the way, things are only getting better.\nThe game's sense of humor is very charming and self-aware, from dialogue to item descriptions and the soundtrack is just as charming, both fitting with the indie retro theme.\nIt's also got co-op multiplayer, although I'd use the term cooperative loosely. More cooptional. Which is hilarious most of the time and I love it.\n\nCan't wait for the full release but until then, totally get this game early access.

Many games have tried to implement this level of freedom, but it usually always comes off as shallow or still too limited. Below is a list of pros and cons (and some in between) for those who like lists.\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n[list]\n   [*] Plenty of item variation, especially for an EA title.\n   [*] A nice selection of characters with unique unlocking parameters and abilities.\n   [*] Most missions have countless methods of completion, assuming you're the right character or have the right items.\n   [*] It's not completely RNG based. Your chance of a winning run is likely around 25% RNG and 75% skill.\n   [*] The \"continuity reward\" system is great. Earn currency on all runs, unlock new items and traits, repeat.\n   [*] Relatively bug-free, especially for EA. I've only run into a couple of small bugs, none of which were game breaking.\n   [*] The current floor tiers have a surprising amount of variation, leading to a few different strategies based on your floor.\n   [*] Relatively great balance between items. Certain items are obviously better, but are also more rare and vice versa.\n   [*] Frequent enough updates at regular intervals (every two weeks).\n   [*] The developer obviously cares about this game and interacts with the community for suggestions and feedback.\n[/list]\n\n[b]Pros or Cons (depending on the person):[/b]\n[list]\n   [*] This game isn't really difficult per se, but it doesn't really need to be. It's less a rogue-like and more an interactive sandbox. You can turn up the difficulty with modifiers if you'd like.\n   [*] Characters only really have one major difference between each other (their \"special ability\"). Otherwise, it's only looks, base stats, shared traits, and starting items that change. Most characters still succeed in feeling unique.\n[/list]\n\n[b]Cons[/b]\n[list]\n   [*] All of the floors have yet to be implemented. Obviously this isn't a permanent issue, just one for the current state.\n   [*] Some of the content becomes quickly predictable (i.e. [spoiler]end-of-floor-tier disasters[/spoiler] ). As more content is added, this should become much less noticeable.\n   [*] Multiplayer is still a bit unstable, but many improvements are actively being made.\n   [*] Some of the more interesting sounding features haven't yet been implemented.\n[/list]\n\nOutside of what's mentioned above, would I mention buying this title now even if you don't trust EA promises? Yes, very much so. There's plenty of content available right now, and even if no more updates come out I'd still be happy enough with the game. Of course, assuming the developer's passion stays, I can see this game easily becoming an indie classic.", "timestamp_created": 1500136673, "timestamp_updated": 1500136785, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33562928": {"recommendationid": "33562928", "author": {"steamid": "76561197963402596", "num_games_owned": 633, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 226, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506206471}, "language": "english", "review": "Controller still isnt working Guessing it has to do with my racing wheel drivers seem to be the root cause even when not connected However Keyboard works and its a Very fun game.

It lives up to being the Stealth-Top-down-shooter-rogue-lite-dungeon-crawler-strange-but-awesome-hybrid-megagame. The gameplay is very fun. There are many ways to go about each level, whether it is to just rambro it and just go ham, stealth through a level without being seen, or do a weird combination of both. The controls are very simple, so if you are new to the game you won't get get confused by any combos or other stuff like that. The game also has a lot of game mechanics that are very easy to learn. They are all pretty much self explanatory. This game is also SO much fun with other people, especially friends. Being able to work to together or just to mess around together is so much fun.\n\nOne problem I do have with the game is that it is overpriced. I think $15 is a bit much for a game like this. Granted I did get it on sale for $7.50, but I think that is still overpriced. With the content inside it, its more of a 5 or 4 dollar game. This game is no where near a Hyper Light Drifter or a Transistor, so it shouldn't be almost worth as much as those games. Another problem I have with this game is that, even thought the gameplay is fun, a lot of the mission are quite linear. It is usually along the lines of \"Retrieve this item\" or \"Neutralize this person\". These missions show up a lot, and can get really boring.\n\nAll in all, this game is pretty good.

And the balance between going berserk and being a ghost is well drawn: they both makes you feel strong at first, but when you fuck up....well you'll understand.\n\nIf you love Rogue-likes, buy it and if you don't like them give it a try, it feels similar and different at the same time so it might suit you.\n\n10/10 would chloroform bartenders again.", "timestamp_created": 1499946852, "timestamp_updated": 1499946908, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504249", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33500292": {"recommendationid": "33500292", "author": {"steamid": "76561198162145696", "num_games_owned": 104, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 3584, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 7, "last_played": 1514109425}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uac8c\uc784\uc774 \ub098\uc624\uae30 \uc804. \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \uc778\ub514\uac8c\uc784 \uc0ac\uc774\ud2b8 Itch.io \uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\uc5f0\ud788 \ub9c8\uc8fc\uce5c Streets Of Rogue...\n\ucc98\uc74c\uc5d0\ub294 \ub108\ubb34\ub108\ubb34 \uc911\ub3c5\uc131\uc788\uace0 \uac04\ub2e8\ud558\uace0 \uc2ec\uc2ec\ud480\uc774\ub85c \uc990\uae30\uae30\uc5d0 \ucd5c\uace0\uc600\uc8e0\n\uadf8\ub7f0\ub370 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8 \ub420 \uc218\ub85d \ub298\uc5b4\uac00\ub294 \uce90\ub9ad\ud130, \ud2b9\uc131, \uc5ec\ub7ec\uac00\uc9c0 \uc2a4\ud14c\uc774\uc9c0 \uac1c\uc120\ubc0f \ucd94\uac00.\n\uc774\uac8c \ub9d0\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc7a5\ub09c\uc544\ub2c8\uac8c \uc911\ub3c5\uc131\ub118\uce5c\ub2f5\ub2c8\ub2e4?\n\nGTA\uac19\uc740 \ub290\ub08c\uc774\ub77c\uace0\ub294 \ud558\ub294\ub370 GTA\ub77c\uace0 \ud558\uae30\uc5d4 \ub108\ubb34 \uc790\uc720\ub3c4\uac00 \ub192\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4\n\n\uc608\ub97c\ub4e4\uc5b4, \n\uc790\uc2e0\uc774 \uace0\uc6a9\ud55c \uc0ac\ub78c\uc774\ub098 \uc6b0\ud638\uc801\uc778 \uc774\ub4e4\uc744 \uc5b8\uc81c\ub4e0\uc9c0 \ub204\uad6c\ub4e0\uc9c0 \uc81c\ud55c\uc5c6\uc774 \ub4b7\ud1b5\uc218 \uac08\uae38\uc218\uc788\ub294 \uac83..\n\uc18c\ub780\uc744 \uc77c\uc73c\ucf1c \ud0c0\uac9f\uc774 \ud55c\ub208\uc744 \ud30c\ub294 \uc0ac\uc774\uc5d0 \uac08\uae30\ub294 \ud1b5\uc218.. \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \ub0a8\uc758 \uc9d1\uc5d0 \uc740\uadfc\uc2ac\uca4d \ub4e4\uc5b4\uac00\uc11c\n\ubab0\ub798 \ubb3c\uac74 \ud6d4\uce58\uace0 \ub098\uc624\uae30 (\uadfc\ub370 \uc774\uac83\uc774 \uaf64 \uace0\ub3c4\uc758 \ucee8\ud2b8\ub864\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud568)\n\n\uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 AI\uc758 \uc218\uc900\uc774 \ud615\ud0dc\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \ub2e4\ub974\uae34 \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc55e\uc73c\ub85c \uac1c\uc120\uc758 \uc5ec\uc9c0\uac00 \ud655\uc2e4\ud558\ub2e4\uace0\ub3c4 \ubd05\ub2c8\ub2e4\ub9cc\n\ub2f9\uc7a5\uc758 AI\uc758 \uc804\uccb4\uc801\uc778 \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub294 \ud50c\ub808\uc774\uc5b4\uac00 \uc54c\uc544\ucc44\uae30 \ub108\ubb34\ub098\ub3c4 \uac04\ub2e8\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\n\ubb34\uc5c7\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc5ec\ub7ec\ubd84\uc774 \uac00\uc7a5 \ub208\ubb3c\uc744 \ud758\ub9b4\ub9cc\ud55c \ubd80\ubd84\uc740 \ubc14\ub85c '\uc0ac\uace0\uc0ac(\u6b7b)' \uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\ubb54\uac00 \ud55c\ucc3d \uc798 \ub418\ub354\ub77c\ub3c4 '\ub2e4\uad6c\ub9ac\uc5d4 \uc9c4\uc9dc\ub85c \uc7a5\uc0ac\uc5c6\ub2e4'\uc640 '\ub208\uac10\uc73c\uba74 \ucf54 \ubca0\uc778\ub2e4'  \ub77c\ub294 \ub9d0\uc774 \uc815\ub9d0\ub85c \uc640\ub2ff\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\n\uac04\ub2e8\ud558\uace0 \ube60\ub974\ub2e4.\n\ub77c\ub294 \ub9d0\ub85c \ud50c\ub808\uc774\ub97c \uc694\uc57d\ud560\uc218\uc788\uaca0\uc9c0\ub9cc\n\n\uac04\ub2e8\ud558\uace0 \ube60\ub974\uac8c \uac00\ubc84\ub9b0\ub2e4.\n\uac00 \ub420 \uc218\ub3c4 \uc788\uaca0\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\n\uc774\ucbe4\ub418\uba74 \uc544\uc2dc\uaca0\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub85c\uadf8\ub77c\uc774\ud06c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.  \uc2a4\ud14c\uc774\uc9c0(\uce35, \ud50c\ub85c\uc5b4)\ub97c \ud074\ub9ac\uc5b4\ud560 \ub54c \ub9c8\ub2e4 \uc810\uc810 \ub09c\uc774\ub3c4\uac00 \ub192\uc544\uc9c0\uace0(17/07/13\uae30\uc900 3-3 \uae4c\uc9c0\uac00 \ucd5c\ub300)\n\ubcc0\uc218\uc758 \uc218\uac00 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ud06c\uac8c \uc99d\uac00\ud574\ubc84\ub9b0\ub2f5\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\ubb3c\ub860 \uc5ec\ub7ec\ubd84\uc758 \uac8c\uc784\uc2a4\ud0c0\uc77c\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uc774\uaca8\ub0b8\ub2e4\uba74\n\n\uc9c0\uae08 (2017/07/13 \uae30\uc900\uc73c\ub85c) \uc5ec\ub7ec\ubd84\uc5d0\uac8c \uae30\ub2e4\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5d4\ub529\uc740\n\uace0\uae43\ub369\uc5b4\ub9ac  \uc5d4\ub529\uc77c\uac81\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc65c\ub0d0\uad6c\uc694?

promises almost a ridiculous amount and boy does it deliver. This game is evidently still in early days yet, as noted by the alpha tag and in terms of additional content, but the core gameplay loop is there and it's wonderfully varied. The character unlock system is fluid and very fun, you always have a refreshing amount of options in terms of playstyles and it's fun in and of itself to unlock the new classes, which create sort of gimmick runs (completing a level with only your fists/undetected etc). Want to be a gorilla fist fighting and lunging everything? Sure. Want to be a thief and stealth about, teleporting into walls and getting in and out before anyone notices? Sure. Gang member inciting turf wars? These are all things many games promise but the execution of Streets of Rogue is spot on, it actually delivers this.\n\nThe music is great, the aesthetic is great and it feels very satisfying to play each character class as they were intended.

There are three floors (or at least right now) each floor has 3 parts. You have to complete all the missions on a part of the floor to go to the next which people don't seem to write about. People keep on complaining about many bugs but i havent seen that many bugs while i play to be honest. But there is one big bug that have yet to be solved if that when you die your friend can ressurect you by giving half of his life but that somethimes doesn't work even if he has enough hp. To summarize it all it is a game with equal pros and cons. But i will have to say a no to the game because if you want to win the game by yourself you can only do it with the soldier character.

I understand it is a rogue like game, but I see some potential to build it potentially into a RPG. Whether the devs are going for that - not completely sure. Just an FYI for my reader : I'm not a huge rogue-like type fan so games like this are usually off my radar (unless its Rogue Legacy). \n\nStreets of Rogue is a rogue-like game. Meaning, its a game you are meant to play and not die. Once you die, you start all over again. You are, however, able to save your progress at anytime simply by quitting the game. This progress is only saved only if your character/player is still alive. If you happen to die during your adventure, it's time to start ALL over again! That's the small issue I have with this game. Although I understand the point of rogue type games, it sort of drives me nuts that I have to go sifting through a bunch of garbage bins and houses to acquire money, items and weapons. The [b]gameplay[/b] itself is simple and straight forward. One joystick is used to navigate while another allows you to aim your attack. \n\nThe basic premise of the game involves completing main missions on the map. This can be rescuing someone or taking someone out. Along the way, you may come across salesmen, items you can pick up or people you can hire for your cause. You can choose to fight whoever or ignore whoever. There are times you will be forced to fight as there will be no other way to complete your mission. One feature (besides beating someone up to clear a building) is you can poison the ventilation system in the building and force everyone out. Because the game is still in early access, I think there is a lot more that can be added to diversify how you would like to approach a scenario. Speaking of diversity, you are also able to choose a unique character with distinct abilities to complete your mission. Gangsters for example start off with weapons and are able to recruit other gang-members for free on the map. Each character has different endurance, strength, speed and accuracy. I can definitely respect the variety of abilities and (unlock-able) characters. The game features local co-op as well as online gameplay which is awesome.\n\nThe [b]visuals[/b] follow a pixel style art. It is suitable to the game and the effects were done decently well. I hope they add a few more animations (or details) in the future. The [b]sounds[/b] are okay overall. I think this domain definitely needs some improvement to make the player feel the impact they make in the game (whether its fighting others or hitting something). \n\nOverall, the game is okay at this point. As I've said before - I'm not a big rogue-like game-type fan, but if you are I'm sure you'll enjoy it. If you want to back this game in early access I would say buy it on sale. I don't think the full-price is worth it (just yet... let's hope). I will hit the recommend button, but before I do I'd like to say PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU DO YOUR HOMEWORK ON THIS ONE! Check the updates, check the discussions, look at other reviews and see what everyone is saying too.\n\n\nRATING : 6.85/10\n\n\n[table]\n[tr]\n    [td]Gameplay[/td]\n    [td]C+[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n    [td]Story / Campaign[/td]\n    [td]C+[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n    [td]Visuals / User Interface[/td]\n    [td]C+[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n    [td]Sounds / Music[/td]\n    [td]C[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n    [td]Replay-ability[/td]\n    [td]C[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n    [td]Overall [/td]\n    [td]C[/td]\n[/tr]\n[/table]\n", "timestamp_created": 1499573834, "timestamp_updated": 1499573834, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.568248", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33392345": {"recommendationid": "33392345", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025004435", "num_games_owned": 144, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2700, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512524482}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is really fun.

Even in its current unfinished state this is already very playable and a lot of fun.  There's a good selection of characters to choose from and a nice variety of items and weapons.   Disasters such as riots, radiation blasts and bombs dropping spice the levels up occasionally to keep you on your toes as well.  Thought has been put into the game's systems and how things interact giving it more depth than it may initially seem to have.  Good amount of replay value too as the different characters encourage quite different playstyles.  Graphics are charming and well drawn plus the music is really catchy too.\n\nHow much long-term value will be in the final package remains to be seen but with more areas to be added and more characters, traits, items and mutators too it certainly looks like it'll be good value for its price point.  Already you have a very enjoyable game that has been very stable for me with no crashes or locks and really just the occasional minor glitch.

As such, many of the things I mention could be subject to change when the game releases fully on Steam. At such time I will likely write a full review of the game.\n\nSo guys, I know it hasn't been a long time since I posted here but here it is my Streets of Rogue Early Access Recomendation. Enjoy it!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n\nWide range of characters to choose from. As of version 28, they are 22 characters to choose from with potential slots ingame for 48 characters!\nMost of the characters feels different and plays differently.\nThe Levels are randomized, which gurantees a different experience each and every time.\nPlenty of different weapons and Gadgets to choose from.\nFreedom to explore and an alive world which reacts to you\nA very passionate developer and a great publisher behind the game\nCo-Op and Multiplayer mode which allows you to play with up to 4 friends!\nVery good AI, which will actually pose a significant threat to you\nA variety of customization options\nTutorial is very informative\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n\nSome characters kinda feel repetitive and similar\nSome levels tend to experience some lag when other times the game runs smothly (However it is getting addressed which I appreciate)\nThe music gets very repetitive after a while\n\n[b]Pros/Cons depending on the player:[/b]\n\nThe Game can be hard to get into at first, but after a couple of hours you get used to it\nSteam Achievements are in the game\nThe Graphic presentation might put some people off\nIt's an Early Access title so it's not yet complete\nA very great sense of humor that might not be for everyone though\nMissions could potentially get repetitive after a couple of hours playing\n\nEnjoyed the review and wanna read more?

I don't even know where to begin.\nThis game plays like your classic rogue-like. It's a top down RPG with a pixelated environment. It also plays like a hack-n-slash (if you so choose to take that route of relentless killing, or if you're unfortunate enough to be caught up in a riot.) There's lots of ways to play and nobody is ever going to play the same exact way as another. You can do a complete pacifist round, or you can get by with sly remote hacking. You can play as weird characters such as the midget Shapeshifter who for some reason decided being naked was completely okay, but that also comes at the price of cops attacking you on sight. That brings me to another great point.\n\nEach character you can play as (there's many, some you have to unlock) has certain unique things about them that make them what they are. These aspects can either hinder or help your playstyle and the way you decide you want to go through each level. Some of these character traits can also be negative, causing the game to seem a little unfair, albeit hilarious, at some points. \n\nThe multiplayer is fun and actually creates more of a challenge depending on how hard headed the people you are playing with. If they aggitate a cop, said cop is also going to come after you. Multiplayer can get pretty chaotic at some points, especially when playing with a full group, but that's not really a complaint. My biggest problem with multiplayer so far has been there are no shared rewards so completing tasks feels like a race. Each level has a set of tasks you have to complete along with a reward item. These tasks vary from silly things like having to kill off the bartender to slightly annoying tasks like needing to push a bunch of buttons. \n\nIf you're playing with a group of people and you have a task to push those buttons, there may be four buttons you have to push, and you may successfully activate three, but if somebody comes along and activates the fourth then the game triggers completion of that task and they go away with all the spoils. Do you get rewarded? Nope, unless the person is generous and decides to give you the reward. \n\nI also just want to say I think Matt is such a wonderful and talented person. There's so much he's put into this game that even whole AAA studios cannot pull off. This game deserves more than to just be called an alpha. I know there's a ton more content he plans on putting out and expanding on but Streets of Rogue really plays like a fully fleshed out game.\n\nThis game got me back into wanting to play games after falling into depression from too much stress. I look forward to every moment I get to play and keep recommending it to everyone and I will definitely continue to do so.", "timestamp_created": 1499254437, "timestamp_updated": 1499254639, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518310", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33270822": {"recommendationid": "33270822", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042008739", "num_games_owned": 333, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 1110, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501690583}, "language": "english", "review": "Haven't been addicted to game like I have with this in a long time.

We found out they make a devastating combo by stunning enemies with the slave masters taser so the doctor can safely knock them out.

We had already deactivated the traps with the computer, and as we almost got to the exit after taking everybody out one-by-one with our strategy mentioned above stealthily without being seen, when a giant metal...thing fell on us killing us both instantly.  The point of this ramble is this game is freaking amazing if you're willing to give it a try, actually strategize, and get effed in the end anyways in quite often hilarious ways.  The only gripe I have is the raining bombs disaster was creating tons of lag, and it got worse as it went on which makes me think either too much going on with the destruction physics or maybe a possible memory leak during the event but who knows.

The first time I loaded it up, I didn't stop playing for 6 hours.\n\nWhat's really neat about this game is that the multitude of different characters roaming each stage tend not to be hostile. That is, until you break into their home, or do something that pisses them off (Cops don't like when you commit crimes, business owners don't like tresspassers or vandalism, and gang members will attack on sight if you're playing as a member of the opposite gang.) Of course, if you're so inclined you could beat these random civilians up and steal their stuff.\n\nEach stage has you completing different missions, mainly fetching an item (but not necessarily steal), incapacitating an NPC (but not necessarily kill), rescuing an NPC, pressing switches in a building, etc. How you go about it is up to you, and there's a ton of variety in your options.\n\nYou could complete entire levels using stealth, pacifism, violence, hacking, explosions, or guile. Things like, dropping poison into a building's air conditioner vents to kill everyone inside, or hacking a computer from outside to disable traps in the building, creeping up behind guards and chloroforming them, using an item to trick the guards into attacking explosive objects, or just going in with a shotgun and gunning everyone down are all viable options, and it's really fun trying out different methods and playstyles.\n\nThere's a multitude of different classes in the game. From Cops, to Hackers, to Doctors, to Werewolves, to Apes, each of them with unique abilities and traits that drastically change how you play. For example, playing as a Thief grants you a crowbar, and a plethora of tools that help you with breaking and entering buildings, but many shopkeepers aren't going to be too keen on a masked bandit wearing a striped shirt wandering into their store. Playing as a Cop lets you start with a pistol and baton, and gives you the ability to arrest any NPC, effectively incapacitating them non lethally, but you lose experience if you hurt civilians, so you can't go around mugging folks for money and weapons like you can with other classes.\n\nEvery few stages has a kind of \"event\" that happens called a disaster. It's pretty exciting when you're told that there's a killer robot stalking you, or a riot occuring where all the NPCs are bashing each other with baseball bats while the cops struggle to keep order. These disasters are meant to be an obstacle, but each one of them can be used to your benefit if you're clever.\n\nThe difficulty is just right I think. The game doesn't pull any cheap bullshit, but will punish you for recklessness, when you get too greedy, or if you don't make an effort to keep healing items stocked. There's also not really a lot of trial and error bullshit. It's usually very clear when something is going to kill you, and there's really nothing in the way of instant kill surprises. Unlike many other Roguelikes, there's no time limit or other entity that forces you to move forward. You can tackle each stage at your own pace and leisure.\n\nSome of the planned features include character creation and world seeds. I'm looking forward to those!\n\nA few other notes; within the first few minutes, I already had the music stuck in my head. It's incredibly catchy and had me wigglin' my hips as I played. The animations and sprites are simple, but smooth and the game looks pretty enough for an 8/16 bit style. The download size is very small, even for a dinky little sprite game. The level of polish on this game is very high. The game is goofy, but not overly so. Yes, the main currency in the game is chicken nuggets, but you're not going to find a booger mage class.\n\nOverwhelming reccomendation from me.", "timestamp_created": 1499117387, "timestamp_updated": 1499117387, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33202273": {"recommendationid": "33202273", "author": {"steamid": "76561198271740185", "num_games_owned": 189, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 233, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500791751}, "language": "english", "review": "Senseless violence...

If you have ever wanted to kill ghosts, buy this game. If you have ever wanted to throw lamp posts at cops, buy this game. If you ever wanted to be a nak*d shape shifter, travel into a slave masters body, and commit many crimes so that when you are eventually caught you can blame the slavemaster, buy this game.  In all seriousness, this is exactly the kind of game I was looking for in the summer sale. Action packed yet requires strategy with tons of silliness and replayability included! The game has been developed by a one man wrecking crew who has his own discord page so he can interact with fans and take suggestions. As it is still in Alpha, a couple of people have had bugs, but the developer is very active in fixing them and updating the game with more items and characters! Multiplayer is extremely fun as well! I have played with random people so many times and we always seem to be friends by the end of it.

With the procedural generation of the levels, so many varied character classes to chose from, and so many different items to find and use together, it offers massive replayability.\n\nI played a game just now, I was playing as a trigger happy soldier, and found a 'bracelet of strength' ... Yeah, this game mixes genres a fair bit, it brings together but not limited to, cannibals, killer robots and vampires ... and spent the next 15 minutes smashing my way through the missions on offer. There's something so satifying about whacking a goon with a baseball bat through a wall and into the bar next door before he has a chance to pull his gun on you!\n\nAnother fun character class to play is the hacker; it requires you to think a little more strategically because you're not a strong class, but you have infinite 'hacks' you can use on electronics. These include the standard computer consoles scattered about in various complexs, allowing you to redirect and vent poison to clear out their inhabitants, open prison doors to cause chaos, and so on. You can also hack TV sets and cause them to explode (great for a stealth kill to avoid the cops), and one of my favourites, you can also hack refridgerators and make them 'run'. You have to play it to see, but you can cause some great chain reactions. And that's the key as to why this game is so much fun, one little decision can spawn chaos and turn the tide of a game.", "timestamp_created": 1499082154, "timestamp_updated": 1499082211, "voted_up":

barkeeper/policeman/drug dealer/shopkeeper/investment banker/comedian etc., but also a spy for a government opposing rebel faction that kinda has no idea what they're doing.\nSo while making your way through the devastated distopia of the games city world you also need to fulfill crucial mission objective orders straight from your rebel HQ. The fun thing about that is that there's literally millions of ways of doing that, and depending on what job you're educated in there's even more ways with every playthrough.\nFor example: HQ orders to get a harddrive from the shopkeeper in town. Now, you could kill the shopkeeper and take it, or you could just threaten him to do just that if he doesn't give it to you right now, or you could give him a very valuable item in exchange. But if you are a shopkeeper yourself you can just buy it from him, if you are a thief you can steal it from him, if you are a slavemaster you can enslave him and make him give it to you, and this whole variability makes the game incredibly fun and long-living.\n\nOther than the missions which are well planned in theory and well executed in practice, the game is all about the player being able to do whatever the fuck they want. I especially like freeing gorillas from science labs while there's still scientists in there with them.

All in all this is a lovely arcadesque couch co-op.\n\nPROS:\n\n+Insanely fun co-op\n+Satifying sound design\n+Diverse styles of approach to combat, developed further by traits\n+Co-op goes from shared-screen to split screen fluidly\n+4 player co-op, hybridizing online and offline\n+Entertaining AI\n+Dialogue lines are funny\n+Progression system is pretty fun\n+All characters have diverse play styles and seem to cover all the bases of said play styles for rouge-likes/rouge-lites\n+Diverse weapons and Buffs continue to diversify approaches\n+Dev that responds to feedback within minutes (litterally)\n\nNEUTRAL:\n\n+/-Game uses 'random' humor at times(I like it but SO did not)\n+/-Music is good, but not memorable\n+/-Mutators are both really good and really annoying, depending on which you get\n+/-Lack of content at the moment (the game is updated every week though, consistently too)\n+/-RNG hurts sometimes, but that's the way the news goes\n\nCONS:\n\n-All Partners are effected by the actions of a single player (cops stay aggro at all players if a crime is witnessed)\n-Quests can be failed due to RNG\n\nI highly suggest this game with at least one friend especially if you enjoy local co-op games", "timestamp_created": 1498931648, "timestamp_updated": 1499028480, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33089969": {"recommendationid": "33089969", "author": {"steamid": "76561198258805807", "num_games_owned": 1218, "num_reviews": 64, "playtime_forever": 12986, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510325679}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8fd9\u4e2a\u53ef\u6bd4\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u5176\u4ed6\u6e38\u620f\u597d\u73a9\u591a\u4e86\uff0c\u7b80\u76f4\u592a\u503c\u4e86\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1498925550, "timestamp_updated": 1498925550, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33089507": {"recommendationid": "33089507", "author": {"steamid": "76561198271910127", "num_games_owned": 41, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 889, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507763407}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is god", "timestamp_created": 1498924809, "timestamp_updated": 1498924809, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33089493": {"recommendationid": "33089493", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005204242", "num_games_owned": 607, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 1812, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507457520}, "language": "english", "review": "Strong potential in this one. \nThis review is based on the Alpha 28 Early Access and already the core game play is providing a good challenge and it's a lot of fun too. I'm just hoping the dev maintains consistent updates on this one!\n\nSo, anyone wanting more info about this game, he's a rundown of story and what to expect.\n\nYou're a part of a crew that is rebelling against a dodgy mayor. So, you'll have to do a whole bunch of random missions to get by. These could be operating some machines at a certain location, maybe a mission where you must take out someone or even rescue someone or something from somewhere, once you do these, you can move on to the next level. \nIf you earn enough XP points, you can pick a perk to carry on with you for the rest of the game. Try and survive if you can, at this moment of time there are 9 levels but fortunately the endless mode can help provide more gameplay. We know that this is all getting extended and updated later in time.\n\nnow, generally during missions there are going to be some obstacles or people who don\u2019t want you to achieve these things. And how you solve these problems comes down to your style of play, which is most likely represented by the class you pick. There's already heaps to pick from and judging from the open spaces there's probably going to be more added. All classes have distinctive styles of game plays, strengths, weaknesses. You know the deal...\nThe thing I think is cool is just how these classes are based on a mix of every day modern work careers to fantasy and weird. \n\nYou can play this single player, online with some buddies or even local co-op too and how you play is up to you. There's a lot of freedom in completing missions from being stealthy, going loud and destroying everyone or if you're clever you might even be able to talk your way into getting other people to do the job for you while you sit back eating bacon cheeseburgers.\n\nBest part, every time you play, levels are randomly generated as well as loot drops too but you can unlock perks and items by playing the game and completing missions so you can give yourself a head start on your next run if you wish. \n\nA lot of fun so far, let\u2019s hope there's more in the future...\n", "timestamp_created": 1498924789, "timestamp_updated": 1498924789, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 25, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.750095", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33088682": {"recommendationid": "33088682", "author": {"steamid": "76561197986706101", "num_games_owned": 198, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 79, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498225635}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041d\u0435\u043f\u043b\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0439 RogueLike, \u043d\u043e, \u041d\u041e, \u043e\u0434\u043d\u0430 \u0431\u0435\u0434\u0430, \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0442 \u043d\u0430\u0434\u043e\u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0438\u0437 \u0437\u0430 \u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0442\u0438\u043f\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0443\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0435\u0439", "timestamp_created": 1498923591, "timestamp_updated": 1498923591, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 49, "votes_funny": 25, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527661", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33087953": {"recommendationid": "33087953", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067234600", "num_games_owned": 129, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 189, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499009356}, "language": "english", "review": "Great teamwork based game, moderately challenging.

The game starts out in slums, an underground town like area. your main objective given by the resistance is to assasinate the mayor because of taxes and beer basically :). The games storyline related stuff is far from finished, but everything else so far is polished. Theres bugs in the game and whatnot but most fans in the discord chat are sending SS and messages to help let the dev about them! the community of this game is really nice and really helpful towards the developer! but back to the game. you get to select so many characters with special abilities that help you decide how you get to the end of each stage. The game is roguelike as seen. you complete a couple missions on each stage and the elavator opens allowing you to advance upward. simple enough, but every 3rd level a disaster starts. it can be something like RIOTiNG, where random npcs go agro on literally everyone else. or something like one KILLER ROBOT THAT CHASES YOU DOWN WITH AN RPG, ATTEMPTING TO KILL YOU AT ALL THEIR MIGHT! but there are really fun side things you can do to help you past most of these objectives, items, weapons, and drugs. Theres pills like the gigantisizer which makes you a giant able to crush through most objects. (WHICH IS AWESOME! :DDD) But multiplayer makes the game so much funnier. And useful at that! theres bugs and whatnot but easily overlooked when you are blasting through goons, scientists, cannibals, soldiers and MUCH, MUCH more! the ost is spectacular and theres a song for each level! and they fit the tone of the map as well! oh yeah, also each level is randomly generated ;)\n\n\n\nListen, just buy the damn game.

An assortment of people, buildings, police, and crimelords comes together to create plenty of hilarious interactions, and leaves the player plenty of room for creativity in how they want to solve their missions.\n\nThere is a wealth of character class variety, with each class having its own distinct gameplay styles.

teniendo cada cual un rol (ej. hacker, gorila, ladr\u00f3n, soldado... y m\u00e1s desbloqueables) y tienes que completar unos objetivos por piso para desbloquear el ascensor y pasar al piso superior.\nEl objetivo es llegar al \u00faltimo piso de la ciudad y acabar con el alcalde o no s\u00e9, con el que gobierna\nEs mejor que el M\u00f3naco en todo.[/i]\n\nAdem\u00e1s, en el pr\u00f3logo que el juego te pone en contexto hay unos di\u00e1logos con buen toque de humor y algunas faltas ortogr\u00e1ficas que... bueno, el juego compensa.\n\nLo he jugado poco, pero es bastante entretenido. Y hoy cabr\u00eda resaltar como algo positivo que muy bien que el desbloqueo de personajes vaya en funci\u00f3n del tiempo y la habilidad y no a base de dlcs.\n\n[b]Edito:[/b] Me ha gustado comprobar que este es un Early Access real. No es el t\u00edpico juego que se queda as\u00ed durante a\u00f1os con bugs abandonad\u00edsimo por parte de los desarrolladores y poco a poco por la comunidad, no. Siguen con la implementaci\u00f3n de objetos, niveles, personajes, bonificadores al subir de nivel... y como ya anuncian en el \"hall\", pr\u00f3ximamente las semillas.

Anyways, jokes aside this here is the epitome of RPG games in a retro style It is utterly Amazing and completely replayable and fun with lots of wacky characters and NPCs, some modifiers, items and gadgets, and unlocks. It's unique and utterly fun with some fun couch and online co-op too.\n\n[h1] Pros [/h1]\n\n[list]\n    [*]Several Different Characters to play with their own unique abilities and perks and non-perks that change your play style - You can play a thief, a normal guy, a worker, a drone, a Gorilla?!?, a Doctor, and a Slave Master now, and so much more with more updates coming adding more.\n    [*]Lots of great gadgets and fun items and even more to unlock with the currency CHICKEN NUGGETS.\n    [*]Randomized levels everytime you enter with a different scenery with new gimmicks and traps and characters after every 3 sub-levels of the main levels. (Ex: Level order 1-1; 1-2; 1-3; 2-1; etc.)\n    [*]You are essentially a criminal and can do whatever you want which involves murder, stealing, arson, destruction, and several more crimes\n    [*]Several objectives for you to complete in a level in whatever way you want it\n    [*]In case gameplay gets boring, there are modifiers which you may run into one [spoiler]ever 3rd sub-level like bombs falling from the sky every couple seconds, being chased by a killer robot with an RPG and periodic radiation: Also more, but you find out the rest[/spoiler]\n    [*]Lots more to find and very replayable and fun overall\n    [*]I have yet to run into a bug or balancing issue.\n    [*]It's a Rogue-Like: Lots of replay value and you will die and replay a lot.\n    [*]VERY LOW-SPEC REQUIRED FOR COMPUTER. DON'T BOTHER ASKING IF YOUR COMP CAN RUN IT, I AM SURE IT CAN\n[/list]\n\n[h1] Cons [/h1]\n[list]\n    [*]You know, I haven't really found any cons\n    [*]I guess sometimes the game gets repetetive if you play the same character for like 10 hours, but I played the doctor for like 5 straight hours and was still having a blast\n    [*]It's a rogue-like: You will die in some stupid ways - Con and Pro! It's hilarious sometimes XD\n    [*]The game isn't done, but that also means way more updates, however you can only play up to a certain point before *SPOILERS* [spoiler] The game kills (Explodes/Gibs) you when you go to the exit of the 3rd level {3-3} (NOT SUB-LEVEL)[/spoiler]\n[/list]\n\nOverall, the game is very enjoyable and definitely worth the full price to me. It isn't quite done yet, but in time it will be and what we have already is one of the best game experiences I have had in a long time.

Or go crazy and give everyone Rocket Launchers. You hate those Axe wielding bastards? Turn off melee weapons or turn off ranged weapons, make everyone have low HP or make everyone hate you on sight. Turn on/off Distasters or simply play around in Sandbox mode.\n\nThe game is still in EA and yet one can have so much fun in the game already, I can't wait to see what the devs will implement in the future. \n\nThe only real gripe I have with the game is that multiplayer (Internet) is sometimes bugged, connecting doesn't always work and sometimes you have bugged Level Designs (in Mulitplayer). Also lag can be sometimes pretty rough, but I'm not sure if it is the games or my buddies connections fault.

Sufficient mission variety and randomized puzzles to keep things interesting with a fast-paced focus. Different approaches may be taken to solve each mission based on class and available resources.\n\nPros:\n-Fast pacing, plenty of action. Or take it slow and methodical.\n-Randomized events keep up the surprise factor.\n-Easy multiplayer.\n-Replayability and unlocks.\n\nCons:\n-Class balance. Vampire is OP, particularly with multiplayer situations as you may repeatedly resurrect fallen comrades. Meanwhile, other classes suffer to the point of being not quite unplayable, but just supremely lacking aside from the humor factor.\n-Items become less useful. Plenty of item variety, but a lot of it would be called \"vendor trash\". Sometimes a fist is all you need.\n-Classes have stats, but you cannot level stats. Leveling is limited to unlocked abilities, many of these falling into the \"sub-optimal\" category of \"take it if you have no other option\".\n-AI is weak. This isn't a problem for the mooks, but the bigger bosses (rocket launching robot) can be tricked easily in multiplayer scenarios (target nearest player, alternate who is closest, make use of building corners).\n-No option to either continue from where you left off or \"save\" a character you have progressed.\n\nSuggestions:\n-Include a \"safehouse\" option every few levels to save a character. Permadeath should still apply, but if you need to stop the game or continue with a friend, you could.\n-Item to \"save character\" for later use. So, your friend died and you have no way to save your friend. Or maybe you are in a tight spot. Pull that character out and start the level anew at a later date.\n-Balance the classes a bit better, whether this is through level balance vs. classes or with the classes themselves.\n-Stat increases with leveling, option to increase stats you choose.\n-Make items necessary to use - e.g., some mooks should be immune to fists, melee, etc. Otherwise, there comes a point when there is little incentive to use the fancy gun or sword on just anyone.", "timestamp_created": 1496595305, "timestamp_updated": 1496595305, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "32180222": {"recommendationid": "32180222", "author": {"steamid": "76561197976904646", "num_games_owned": 366, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 580, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500997262}, "language": "english", "review": "One the best fun I got in co-op online since a looooong time.

The interactions are smart and well-programmed, allowing for players to do unusual things, only to find that the AI reacts reasonably to them. The AI in this game is quite well-programmed, and take some real thought to outsmart. The game also happens to look surprisingly good for what it is. The Lighting is very advanced and is quite beautiful.\n\nThe game, of course, does have issues, but these are small in number.\n\nEvery third level, there is a challenge that makes the game harder. That's fine, but some characters are incompatible with some challenges. There's one that puts a time limit on the level, you have to retrieve two bombs within a small time limit or instantly die. Some characters, whom are slower, or who are meant for stealth, or otherwise, will have a much, much harder time with this. It may even be impossible.\n\nSome may find the combat unfair or difficult, but I feel that these criticisms are unfair. The combat is very much skill based; without enough skill, you may do very poorly. Saying that the game is unfair because of this is petty. The combat is very easy to pick up but hard to master.\n\nI would compare the combat of this game to Nuclear Throne, the core ideas to The Binding of Isaac, and the difficulty, somewhat, to Catacomb Kids. Like in Nuclear Throne, the combat is fast-paced and almost completely based on skill and quick thinking. Like in The Binding of Isaac, your equipment and items will dictate your strategy and approach, your decisions may heavily affect your future, and resources are important, meaning that you must take advantage of what you have in order to succeed. Like in Catacomb Kids, small choices can have large impacts, and simple mistakes could cost you more than you bargined for.\n\ntl;dr/conclusion:\n\nStreets of Rogue is quite literally, the ultimate roguelike experience. Stealth, strategy, and skill come together so well in this game, leaving players with a multitude of choices that complement a myriad of different characters, skills, and items. The AI is incredibly well designed, acting reasonably based on even the most unusual, complex stimuli, while still being predictable enough for the player to make informed decisions and formulate plans based on their actions. Combat flows smoothly and dynamically, providing a natural challenge that is easy to learn and hard to master. Player's choices are as important as the city around them, meaningful consequences resulting from simple decisions, without being so intrusive as to prevent players from acting spontaneously.\n\nThe strange, wacky world of Streets of Rogue, in conclusion, can only be described as amazing in an endless number of ways.", "timestamp_created": 1495667128, "timestamp_updated": 1495960090, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "31941408": {"recommendationid": "31941408", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024625110", "num_games_owned": 366, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 241, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511584469}, "language": "english", "review": "Currently not worth the price, very little to do.

Hackers. Rocks. Refigerators.\n\nAnd so much more...\n\nI picked this game up from the current Humble Bundle after seeing Northernlion's review of it. It has surpassed my expectations and, in my opinion, has put tinyBuild as one of the best developers in the PC market to date.\n\nStreets of Rogue is obviously a rogue-lite and features many different ways to play. Some of the gameplay is a little luck-based, but that's to be expected from a RL game with seed-generated levels - you aren't always going to be able to accomplish certain tasks with your character, so it makes you have to improvise and adapt. And Streets of Rogue excels in giving you those options.\n\nFor instance, you might need to retrieve an item from a safe in a formidable drug den guarded by patrolling goons. You can introduce a chemical into the airways in hopes it will weaken them then take them out one-by one. Or, perhaps it might be better to just sneak your way through, out of their line of sight. Maybe hack a few systems from afar to make their security go haywire, or off completely. Hell, it might just be up to your gusto and firepower to fire a maelstrom of bullets to turn them into a thin red paste and ransack the place.\n\ntinyBuild's developer Matt Dabrowski single-handedly cemented the idea, to me, that RL's are pretty much at the highest quality of they have ever been, and yet he still finds ways of introducing new ideas.\n\nAs far as controls are concerned, it's extremely responsive and I've had no lag in combat - which is very good considering that the one-on-one combat is very fast-paced. Think of Nuclear Throne mixed with Hotline Miami in terms of combat speed, and you'll know what I mean. However, I do encounter some lag when things explode - not sure if it's there for effect or if the threading in the code just isn't optimized yet. This is an Early Access review, after all.\n\nSure, the graphics aren't astonishing - I've never been one to care about that anyway. It's a darker pixel art aesthetic. Totally works for me. Hell, the game runs at a very consistent 60fps on my system, and I'm sure that lesser systems would fare just fine with this.\n\nThe music - it's fantastic. Some 8-bit sounds mixed with modern. Fits the game perfectly, like a good cabernet with a filet mignon.\n\nIn conclusion, Streets of Rogue is one of the best examples of multi-dimensional gameplay in a rogue-lite. Fans of the genre should point to this as an example of how it's done right with new ideas mixed in. Even in the alpha state, it's completely worth the price tag.\n\nI solidly score this, as an Early Access title, a 9.4/10.", "timestamp_created": 1495196124, "timestamp_updated": 1495196124, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "31838055": {"recommendationid": "31838055", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053935010", "num_games_owned": 435, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1967, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500059791}, "language": "english", "review": "Streets of Rogue is a Rogue-lite simulation-esc game in which you grab one of a number of characters with unique traits and abilities in order to traverse a town of randomly generated buildings completing missions in a number of various ways. The game currently being early access means it currently has no end but the fina end goal is to kill the tyranical mayor whom outlawed chicken nuggets and dance parties (The madman!) \n\n\nStory/Writing: \nThe game has little story, similar to other Rogue-lites. In Streets of Rogue you are a resistance fighter against the tyranical mayor, previously mentioned. You must complete missions for the Resistance in order to ascend through the floors from the Slums to the Industrail area to the Park with more to come in the future. (The game currently has 9 floors, 3 of each with the 3rd having an extra surpriise event) \nWhilst the story is lacking, as expected. The writing and humour in the game truly makes up for it. It's quirky, weird and self aware chock with various pop-culture references. It's a game that all in all, doesn't take itself too seriously and I truly love it for that given the way AAA games have seemingly forgotten that art. \n\nGameplay:\nThe gameplay in Streets of Rogue is relatively both simple and complex at the same time. You can achieve your goals in a number of ways depending on the equipment, character perks and other things you have. For instance, if you play the Scientist, you get a bunch of handy sci-fi esc tools to deal with your foes and can identify syringes (Think the pills in Isaac)  This way you can freeze people and use it as either a way to bypass them or use it as a scapegoat. If that's not working,  you may have some syringes or cigarretes or something similar that you can jam into an air vent to do a number of effects but most of all clear out the building or killl them outright. The best one being Rage potion which causes an all out brawl within whatever building you put it in. \nOptionally, if you perhaps are not the scientist (It's very likely when there are more than 20 characters with more to come)  You can brute force the building as the Jock and run straight through the walls of the building (Some walls are unbreakable) or alternatively play a more stealthy option with the Assassin whom can turn invisible orthe doctor whom can put people to sleep or the gangster who can gain a mob of fellow Crepes or Blahds (Crepes 4 lyfe) There are numerous ways you can attain your objectives and the way you do it is up to you.\nYou can also just outright murder everyone in the map. Or loot everything, or both. You can basically play however you choose. Player Freedom and ingenuity are really at the core of how you play the game. You are rewarded wuith exp, money or other items for whatever it is you choose to do. (Unless you're the cop, you need to be a law abiding citizen)\nSo basically, go buck wild and have a good time!\n\nAesthetic:\nThe Aesthetic is your typical simple 2D sprites with a 3D background being viewed from a top-down perspective. As I stated it's simple but it manages to look nice and clean with little effects here and there to make it more endearing than anything else. Plus the simple nature makes it elatively easy to tell what's going on amidst the chaos that occurs and is sucseptably deceiving for the sheer amount of gameplay that lay beneath the surface. \n\nSoundtrack & Sound Design:\nI had to mention it. It's wonderful. If you're like me, you'll spend 10 minutes per floor and hear the trakc loop numerous times yet it never gets repetetive. It's interesting enough to not become repetitive whilst being equally enjoyable and melodic with various instruments used throughout the game that you dont usually hear i.e Steel Drums. Equally each floor has it's own track so that also greatly aids with avoiding repetiveness.\nAs for Sound Design, everything acts as it should and you can distinguish what is happening via the sound, little clicks for when someone is alerted, alarms when tripping sensors or cameras and explosions that are truly satsfying. Punching people into gibs or through walls has never been so satisfying! \n\nOther notes:\nThe game has multiplayer but I've yet to try it. This is both local and Online. \nThe game has plenty of options to turn on and off to customise the flow of the game and such i.e no slow motion or no blood.\nWhilst the game is in Early Access, the price is definitely worth the purchase. The amount of content within the game is very vast and the game has a lot of potential for what could be added bot hby the commmunity and the developer himself.\nThe Developer. He's great. The game has links to the Wiki, the twitter accounts for both him and the artist, the forum, a link to the devblog and a Discord server too. He's very transparent about the game and is very keen to be involved with the community which is great to see. The game also has a feedback form for if you have any suggestions of what you want added or any bgs that you have found. Also, the games part of a humble bundle already which is pretty crazy.\nUpdates: The game is updated frequently with fixes and new stuff. I'm hoping to see this continue throughout the development of the game and look forward to how the game turns out in the end.\n\nSo, should you buy it? If you read all of that and you aren't going to, then I don't think I can really convince you. The game is truly wonderful and refreshing and I hope to see it grow and be a very successful game. \nOne of the best releases of the year already.", "timestamp_created": 1495190554, "timestamp_updated": 1495190554, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502465", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "31837611": {"recommendationid": "31837611", "author": {"steamid": "76561198139100035", "num_games_owned": 16, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 215, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489402499}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5f53\u521d\u770b\u8001\u83ca\u7684\u8857\u5934\u95f9\u4e8b\u4e4b\u540e\u5c31\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e2a\u5f88\u611f\u5174\u8da3\uff0c\u8fd9\u6b21\u73a9\u4e86\u4e00\u4e0b\uff0c\u7684\u786e\u662f\u4e0d\u9519", "timestamp_created": 1495188353, "timestamp_updated": 1495188353, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}, "31834952": {"recommendationid": "31834952", "author": {"steamid": "76561198324789219", "num_games_owned": 14, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 175, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496827038}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u975e\u5e38\u725b\u903c\u7684\u6e38\u620f", "timestamp_created": 1495173222, "timestamp_updated": 1495173222, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "31834673": {"recommendationid": "31834673", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074240798", "num_games_owned": 108, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 837, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500707822}, "language": "english", "review": "You get extra XP for killing \"innocent\" people. :]\n\n\nI recommend.", "timestamp_created": 1495171417, "timestamp_updated": 1495171417, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497512", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "31833093": {"recommendationid": "31833093", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996627259", "num_games_owned": 1185, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 95, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495161249}, "language": "english", "review": "If you've ever played The Escapists, this is like that, except with a cool criminal underground aesthetic.

It is like that mixed with GTA, without the mature content, but even more gore!\n\nThe many positive aspects of this game include:\n\n[b]Approachability[/b]:\nIn this game, you are given missions to complete in a procedurally generated city. One of the best parts about this game is the many different ways you can solve one problem by interacting with people and the environment. For example, your mission is to kill this guy. What do you do? Well, you can blow him up with a time bomb. You could hack the turrets in the building to fire at him. Maybe shoot him with cyanide in a squirt gun. There are many ways to approach a situation, and your job is to figure out which one best suits the circumstances and best suits your playstyle.\n\n[b]Diversity[/b]:\nStreets of Rogue gives you several characters with several to start out with, and several more to unlock. Each has their own unique traits and abilities to help you through your missions, and all of them play radically differently.\n\n[b]Environment[/b]:\nYou can interact with essentially everything around you. Every single person, trap, wall, and trash can has the potential to be useful to you in some way. Each level (cities, parks, etc.) is extremely different and challenges you to adapt, overcome, and maybe even use obstacles to your advantage.\n\nAll of these three traits tie into what I look for in a game the most: [b]Replayability.[/b]\nEvery single run in Streets of Rogue is different. Even after you unlock all of the content, there are always things to be learned and new solutions to be figured out. There is an unbelievable amount of content in this game and is already well worth the price in its Early Access. Plus, there is much more to come: more characters, levels, and items, which means numerous more hours of gameplay.\n\nOverall I definitely recommend this game to anyone, even if you're not into these kinds of games. It has quickly become one of my favorites simply because of the sheer amount of things you can do. It's like this game never ends.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1494917463, "timestamp_updated": 1494917463, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.689544", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "31782191": {"recommendationid": "31782191", "author": {"steamid": "76561198140753033", "num_games_owned": 2787, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 171, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496754068}, "language": "koreana", "review": "+ \ud55c\uae00\ud654\n+ \uc544\uc8fc \ub192\uc740 \uc790\uc720\ub3c4\n+ \uba40\ud2f0\ud50c\ub808\uc774 \uc9c0\uc6d0\n+ \uc55e\uc11c \ud574\ubcf4\ub294 \uac8c\uc784 (\uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ucee8\ud150\uce20 \ucd94\uac00 \uc608\uc815)\n\n- \uc77d\uae30 \uc5b4\uc0c9\ud55c \ud55c\uae00\n- \uc794\uc778\ud55c \uc694\uc18c\uac00 \uc788\uc73c\ub2c8 \uc8fc\uc758\ud574\uc8fc\uc138\uc694", "timestamp_created": 1494915941, "timestamp_updated": 1494915941, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 36, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.748766", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "31781963": {"recommendationid": "31781963", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012574352", "num_games_owned": 295, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1103, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511405015}, "language": "english", "review": "OVERVIEW-\nThis game is seriously a lot of good fun. Imagine a Rogue-like game with simple yet enjoyable mechanics and loaded with wacky crap that'll keep you busy for hours on end finding new comedic ways to interact with the NPC's and environment. The classes are pretty straight forward yet also fairly unique and enjoyable. What really gets me is that this game is in ALPHA still. There's a good amount of things in it already and with the regular updates that's only going to increase.\n\nCLASSES-\nGoing into the city you get to choose from a good range of classes with more to unlock. From the cut and dry Soldier, Slum Dweller and Gangster (Crepes) classes. To the more fun and intriguing ones like Werewolf, Assassin and Gorilla. Each class has it's own unique traits and starting equipment. Some have special abilities which really will help you find the best way to complete your objectives\n\nMISSIONS-\nAs it stands now the missions in each zone are quite limited. It'll always either be retrieve something, rescue someone, neutrilize some folks, press some buttons or break a thing. But they offer a lot of different ways to accomplish these missions so that buffers the lack of diversity to a degree. I'm sure we'll be seeing plenty more in upcoming updates including the addition of a \"Big Quest\"\n\nITEMS-\nThere's a lot of neat items in this game. Shrink rays, haterizers, dizzy grenades, bear traps, gigantinizers and so so much more. Playing around with them all is a lot of fun. And often creates a nice environment filled with chaos to enjoy.\n\nNEGATIVES-\nThe only real negative things, I have to say about this game are simply because it's Early Access. Them being the lack of diverse missions, enemy types and so forth. But it seems like the developer is set on releasing good updates for it frequently so I'm not worried. The game is very solid and, I can see myself sinking loads of time into it just for the laughs alone.\n\nCOOP-\nThe Coop is solid with good netcode and very little latency issues. As one would expect with this kind of game it add's a whole new  level of fun and replayability to it.\n\nUPDATES-\nThis game updates very frequently with new items, classes, locations and achievements. The developer clearly loves his creation.\n\n8.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1494914264, "timestamp_updated": 1511404986, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505146", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "31780431": {"recommendationid": "31780431", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021133017", "num_games_owned": 271, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 1183, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495825047}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "[b] [h1] **An\u00e1lise do jogo na vers\u00e3o Alpha 24c** [/h1] [/b]\n\n- Eu como um bom f\u00e3 de jogos stealth, me arrisquei em comprar [b] Streets of Rogue [/b].\nLogo de cara me supreendi com a variedade de personagens jog\u00e1veis com habilidades \u00fanicas, onde todos s\u00e3o desbloque\u00e1veis, existindo objetivos para liber\u00e1-los.\n\n- O jogo est\u00e1 sendo atualizado constantemente e por ser um alpha, a presen\u00e7a de bugs \u00e9 certa, mas nada que deixe a desejar.\n\n- O jogo sem si, para se jogar sozinho, enjoa r\u00e1pido depois que se desbloqueia todos os personagens.

Dadurch, dass bei jedem Durchlauf zuf\u00e4llige Level generiert werden, entsteht immer eine neue Spielerfahrung. Also so mehr oder weniger. Im gro\u00dfen und ganzen sind die Aufgaben die man erteilt bekommt irgendwo immer wieder gleich. Nur der Aufbau der H\u00e4user ist anders und die Belohnungen sehen verschieden aus. Im Kern sind sie aber immer das Selbe.\nAuch mag ich es, dass es sehr viele unterschiedliche Charakt\u00e4re zur Auswahl stehen, welche immer verschiedene Pr\u00e4ferenzen aufwei\u00dfen, und man weitere freischalten kann - daf\u00fcr muss man verschiedene Dinge erf\u00fcllen, was zum Teil nicht sofort m\u00f6glich ist, da eben zuf\u00e4llige Welten.\nDas was mich allerdings hier st\u00f6rt ist, dass man viele Level am Ende nur mit Gewalt abschlie\u00dfen kann. Richtiger Stealth ist nicht wirklich m\u00f6glich, entweder weil man nicht die richtigen Gadgets zur Verf\u00fcgung hat oder es die Architektur einfach nicht hergibt. Auch sind die freischaltbaren F\u00e4higkeiten - welche am Ende nur zuf\u00e4llig bei Levelaufstieg oder Aufgaben abschluss erreichbar sind - allesamt eher so komplett \"meh\" und man wei\u00df gar nicht was man mit den, mehr oder wenig, seltenen Punkten so wirklich anfangen soll. Bei mir horteten die sich irgendwie nur, weil ich mit den urspr\u00fcnglichen Dingen alle zufrieden war und einfach nicht wollte, dass ich nur mehr Dinge zur Auswahl bekomme, mit denen ich doch am Ende nichts anfangen kann.\nAber ja doch, ich kann verstehen wenn man mit dem Spiel \u00fcber 100 Stunden Spa\u00df hat - selbst im EA, der etwa nur die H\u00e4lfte der Story einem bietet. Ich meine, das Spiel ist sch\u00f6n verr\u00fcckt, bietet immer mal wieder neue herrangehensweisen sowie viele Dinge zum entdecken.\nMeinen Geschmack hat es leider einfach nicht so wirklich getroffen.

I streamed my first attempt live on beam and later switched to twitch for the twitch interactions (and some beam issues at the time forced the switch) after the last \u201cjust one more life\u201d i realised 3 hours had passed! Usually a first try stream will be 20 minutes to an hour max for uncomplicated games but this was so much fun i just could not stop playing it...i am debating loading it up again now!\nThe characters that you play as are more than just different appearances they have actual pro\u2019s and cons, do you go for the scientist that can knock people out but refuses to use weapons? Or a vampire who has nothing at the start but a bottle of cologne and the ability to heal any wounds by draining humans of excess blood (i am more the latter :))\nWhat really makes it stand out though is the missions are random too, they follow a similar pattern but they are damn fun to play and you never know what missions you will get and always have multiple ways to complete them, i actually stole an item from a chest after a killer robot fired a missile at me\u2026.missed and opened a new \u201cdoor\u201d in the wall completing a mission...i then used my new killer robot pal to open new doors all over by baiting him to shoot at me :) sadly he eventually hit me...vampire 0 killer robot 1\nI completed another mission by knocking on the door of my targets room and when he opened it i shot him with a shotgun...he flew through the wall behind him...AWESOME! 11/10 would use bad guy for interior redecorating again!\nThen there is the wealth of traits and equipment, i love being able to put detonation packs on doors, landmines make for fantastic anti following methods and a fast anti death teleporter is a life saver (see what i did there?)\n\n[b]CONTROLS/CONTROL PAD[/b] \nI played it 100% with an xbox controller and it worked an absolute treat.

Even if I was, it's overdone and ruined by trying too hard to be funny. The few jokes I thought were genuinely clever completely lost their impact by being surrounded by all the other stupid jank. You aren't subverting anything if the rest of world is bonkers, that's not how juxtaposition works.\n\nI can ignore most of this pretty easily. The bulk of it is in the tutorial and you don't have to repeat that nonsense. The thing that really annoys me is the item descriptions. About a quarter of them successfully convey what the item does and the rest that message is lost in the forced joke and some don't even try. Now before people in the comments complain it's a roguelike, you are supposed to experiment to find out what items do... Bulldonk. \n\nFirst of all, at least half the items try to tell you what they do (and half of those succeed). Secondly, this isn't Binding of Isaac with its billions of unique interesting items where you are constantly thrown things you've never seen before that drastically change the gameplay and have immediately noticeable effects. \n\nAlso to clarify I'm not talking about the syringes either, the one thing in the game that you are obviously not meant to know what they do until you identify them. Also, explain to me how you are supposed to figure out having a four leaf clover in your inventory increases you chance to win at slot machines by exactly 3% so you can use that information to weigh up if you want to keep it using up an inventory slot or not? Explain to me how that's going to be fun. It's just sloppy tooltip writing.\n\nSpeaking of the writing you are supposed to be some big hero of the downtrodden saving the city blah blah blah, but you are actively encouraged to murder everyone, scumbags and innocents alike. There is nothing wrong with being able to kill everyone, grand theft auto pretty much gets by on how fun that is. But it's less fun if you feel like you are supposed to be doing it without consequence. There's no slap on the wrist, you don't feel bad for anyone you are killing. They are just walking pinatas that need to be busted open for their weapons and cash and the free bonus experience they bring. You aren't obligated to, but if you aren't murdering every non-hostile in sight then you aren't playing optimally. \n\nMy other major criticism of the game is the pace of the combat. It's clearly going for the Hotline Miami fast paced mayhem vibe. But it's not as visceral or frankly suited to it. Enemies take a lot of beating to take down and the way combat works if you both use a melee attack at the same time they bounce off each other. The AI isn't consistent with its attack timings and it doesn't telegraph so you are mostly just guessing engagement distances to try to predict the timing of the key frames and then you mash the attack button wildly to see if you were right. The high speed pacing does nothing to add to this except make it feel more like futile button mashing without any strategy. But that's okay the game has mutators that let you customise such things to suit yourself, so they have a mutator that lets you turn the speed up by 30% for even more spastic flailing or... Oh wait, that's all. You can't slow it down and have a more thought out tactical experience.\n\nSo that all sucks. How come I recommend the game? \nBecause in spite of all that, the game is still fun though.\n\nIt is an inherently fun game. There's a lot of design choices I disagree with but in spite of those, the gameplay is solid. It's easy to get into, there's plenty of unlocks, abilities, character classes and game modes to keep you coming back and once you do know what the items do the amount of flexibility they give you to your playstyle or for mucking around is great. Whether you just want a short escape to jump into a game and screw around for a bit or you want to settle down for a while and slog away at completing runs and unlocking new abilities, this game delivers. Even on the more invested side of things, you can spend a good hour working on a run and die to a dumb explosion, rage quit, go check facebook, have a snack, get bored and immediately come back and jump back into the game half an hour later like it didn't happen. You are starting over from the begining but the game is that easy to pick up and play and enjoy along the way that it doesn't matter. That's pretty much backbone of any good roguelike right there.\n\nAnd at the end of the day, sometimes, just being a fun game is enough.", "timestamp_created": 1494550671, "timestamp_updated": 1494551162, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504219", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "31690020": {"recommendationid": "31690020", "author": {"steamid": "76561197979901566", "num_games_owned": 240, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 509, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494712832}, "language": "spanish", "review": "este juego es la hostia", "timestamp_created": 1494534800, "timestamp_updated": 1494534800, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510512", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "31689892": {"recommendationid": "31689892", "author": {"steamid": "76561198361478554", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 187, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490980116}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is dope.

However, this does not affect my views and opinions of the game.\n\nStreets of rogue is a pixel-style rogue-lite title by developer Matt Dabrowski and published by tinyBuild. The objective is to traverse each procedurally generated city until the end in order to find and kill the mayor. The game also features cooperative play, both locally and via the internet. The title has a comedic theme both in game-play, dialogue, and story-telling. The game also has RPG elements as well as action, brawler, and stealth game-play mechanics, all of which depend on the player's play style, and the class they choose. \n\n--------\n\n[b] Graphics: 8 / 10 [/b] \n\nArt is very subjective, especially when it comes to pixel-style games. Streets of Rogue has very charming visuals, and even has good effects and animations. All classes have their own design so when things get hectic on the screen, it's a little easier to distinguish the player from the other characters. That being said, things will still become visually cluttered at times, though this is to be expected due to the chaotic nature of the game. Each city is procedurally generated and as the player advances to each new city, the buildings and terrain designs will change depending on the type of city. The game should run fine on any low to mid-tier system, as it's not very demanding on the CPU or graphics card.\n\n--------\n\n[b] Sound: 8 / 10 [/b] \n\nThe sound effects of the game are decent, they get the job done, but where the sound assets really shine, are within the game's soundtrack. The music within the game is great. Composed by Craig Barnes, the soundtrack has very funky, dance-y, blood pumping tunes for each stage of the game. The music very much fits the theme of the game, and is also very well done. \n\n--------\n\n[b] Mechanics: 8 / 10 [/b] \n\nThe base mechanics of the game are pretty straight forward. The character moves around with the arrow keys, uses their equipped item with the left mouse button, activates their special ability with the right mouse button (if they have one), and uses the number keys for items within the hot-key bar. Things will get a little more complicated depending on the class that is chosen. Classes have their own benefits as well as disadvantages. The different classes will have different traits, abilities and starting items that can really affect the way the game is played. New classes can be unlocked by completing certain objectives. The player will level up by completing various tasks, and will be able to choose new traits upon doing so. \n\nThe game ends when the player dies but progression remains in the form of \"chicken nuggets\". Nuggets can be found throughout the game and are a form of persistent currency. They can be used to purchase new traits, quest rewards, starting items and other upgrades at the resistance headquarters/main hub. There are also mutators within the game can can be toggled to further change the game-play experience.\n\nEach stage has objectives the player must complete in order to move onto the next area. These objectives are also randomly generated. Usually, the objectives have many ways to complete them. When an objective involves another character or NPC, the player can bribe them, trade with them, threaten them, or just straight up kill them. Some missions could also involve escorting an NPC or sabotaging a building. The player can also recruit other NPCs to fight alongside them. \n\nThere are many items within the game that do cool and crazy things. Knowing when to use certain equipment or tools does have some strategic thought involved. That being said, almost all terrain is breakable, and almost all NPCs can be interacted with (or attacked). \n\n--------\n\n[b] Final Personal Remarks: [/b]\n\nThe game is a lot of fun. I can't wait to see what else comes out of their early access in terms of content for the game. As mentioned earlier, the soundtrack is really good, and I also recommended getting the OST for it. The OST isn't complete, but will continue to add tracks as the game adds content and new stages. Co-op seems like it could be a lot of fun with friends, though online play might be a little too hectic. This is because without proper communication, I feel like everyone would be all over the place and uncoordinated. The game does receive consistent updates and is overall a fun experience.  \n\nThanks to Matt Dabrowski for giving me the opportunity to review the title, as well as anyone who took this review into consideration, I hope it helped.", "timestamp_created": 1494030025, "timestamp_updated": 1494030025, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 27, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.613645", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}, "31564145": {"recommendationid": "31564145", "author": {"steamid": "76561198126456245", "num_games_owned": 61, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 40, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493995602}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8054\u673a\u592a\u5361\u4e86\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u6293\u7d27\u6539\u5584", "timestamp_created": 1494007297, "timestamp_updated": 1494057912, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.450800", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "31564095": {"recommendationid": "31564095", "author": {"steamid": "76561198272207387", "num_games_owned": 55, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1518, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510938570}, "language": "french", "review": "Un melange entre enter the gungeon/isaac et gta\nEt en constante evolution (encore heureux vu qu\"il est pas fini)", "timestamp_created": 1494007121, "timestamp_updated": 1511548997, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "31561197": {"recommendationid": "31561197", "author": {"steamid": "76561198033146721", "num_games_owned": 1355, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 36, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495325958}, "language": "english", "review": "Super fun game, Really nice story, and is challanging.

All my game time has been in single player, and even alone I'm having a blast. The game makes fun of itself in many instances that are sarcastic and humorous, its minimalistic design keeps it simple enough to understand for pretty much anybody. If you value gameplay over graphics then this is a fantastic game for you. There are SO many ways already to tackle all the different missions you'll be given. The levels are randomly generated based on a seed system.\n\nThe custom seed system has not yet been implimented but the option is already there (Coming Soon) so that tell's me it's right around the corner. The game has a similar unlock system as Enter The Gungeon. As you complete missions and level up your multitude of characters (20 as of this review with more to come), you will earn chicken nuggets which you can unlock new rewards and traits with in your \n\"home-base/Headquarters\" to aquire in your up-coming future playthroughs.\n\nAs I said, there is alot of content here already.

(I'm going off achievements here) right now;\nin each area there are 4 generated levels and each increase with difficulty, don't get me wrong this takes awhile to get through having permadeath with increased difficulty and events like [spoiler]crazy nearly unkillable robots and radiation attacks that nearly insta kill[/spoiler] help prolong the gameplay but more levels do need to be added in at some point\n\nIf you're kinda on the fence about it even though the reviews are generally good and you're iffy about early access I can understand that there's been quite a few failures on steam but I think this does have potential, just alone that Tiny Build are backing Matt (madguy90, aka the dev) is amazing and it really shows and I feel like it'll shine through on the final product. \n\nHe's pulling out updates on a biweekly basis, he tweets stuff out, there's always patch notes which I personally like.\n\nTLDR:\nAt the current state I'd give it a 9/10, my reason being there's always improvement and completion to be had.

That may seem like the start of joke but that situation is more than possible in Streets of Rogue.\n\nThat is the beauty of this title and its mad genius. This game is all about stories, ones you craft and that are usually insane in nature. Vampire Frank and his horrible cocaine addiction. Dr. Dissmelfunay(It\u2019s Belgian) and his constant need to chloroform everybody. Perhaps something more \u201cnormal\u201d with cops and robbers. It\u2019s all there and Streets of Rogue wants you to play it with every toy in the toybox.\n\nIf that doesn\u2019t sell you alone, then the news that you can play with up to three friends online or local co-op should. Now suddenly that Ninja/Wrestler/Gorilla combo can happen and probably will make a vicious team. To quote Bixby Snyder, \u201cI\u2019d buy that for a dollar!\u201d Okay technically fifteen dollars but that\u2019s beyond the point.\n\nDr. Dissmelfunay was my character and the start of an hilarious adventure into Streets of Rogue. I choose Doctor as my class primarily as a challenge unto myself. What could I get away with and how far could I go before somebody put a stop to my insanity? Turns out, pretty damn far! Why was this a challenge? Well, the Doctor class is a pacifist, which means he cannot use any weapons at all and his stats weren\u2019t the greatest. He received double the bonus from using medkits, an item I found twice in my whole run. Finally his coup de gr\u00e2ce was his Chloroform which instantly knocked out enemies. It was his ace card and only attack aside from fisticuffs.\n\nThe good news is that most of the NPCs in Streets of Rogue are rather trusting and naive. Why is a stranger knocking on my door? Next thing they know I\u2019m raiding their fridge for all the beer and sandwiches I can. Its morally wrong, but hey I\u2019ve got to survive for the Resistance. Between selling weapons I didn\u2019t need and robbing everybody in sight, I made it rather far and almost to the current end of the Early Access. Plot twist was that Streets of Rogue has modifiers that throw in chaos, such as riots, radiation flashes and robots with rocket launchers. What finally did in old poor Dr. Dissmelfunay was that there was three massive bombs to disarm in five minutes. Turns out the Doctor wasn\u2019t good at breaching and entering quickly and thus his adventure ended.\n\nThat is the joy of this game though. I had a blast every minute, coming up with new ideas and strategies to use to get my missions accomplished. As the Doctor I had to think outside the box and use poisons, hire hoodlums and sometimes just beat the crap outta somebody. Did I die? Yes but I had blast, literally.\n\nSpeaking of the Resistance, the game has a new intro/tutorial since hitting Steam Early Access. Developer Matt Dabrowski was obviously in a snarky mood when he wrote out his tutorial. You are applauded for such things as following basic instructions. Beating someone to death and unlocking a door which makes someones head explode from excitement. In all it concludes with the death of two resistance members, which is terribly anti-productive, but you get the idea.\n\nThe story is fleshed out a bit more as well introducing, \u201cThe Mayor\u201d character whom I am sure will have something to do with the big mission that we have been promised for a while now. It\u2019s cute and all very tongue in cheek.\n\nThe reason this is all becomes so important, is the introduction of the Resistance base. It houses most of the new features. Streets of Rogue has now given a bit of progression to all aspects of the game such as unlocking classes. Accomplished with simple tasks like using only your fists for three levels. There are also chicken nuggets! That\u2019s not a typo. Chicken Nuggets are currency you earn in game to unlock new traits and loadout/reward items back at the base. Letting you fine tune what you start out with or what kind of random skills/items you may come upon while playing the game.\n\nThe base also houses the Mutators, which is by far going to give the game some longevity. Mutators allow you mess with the game rules by giving everybody low health, disasters every stage, no weapons, rockets only. There is also an endless mode. You can also create your own Mutators for some chaos and fun. Other features that are present but locked off are the Create a Character feature. At this point, it\u2019s purely conjecture, but I am very excited about this idea. Being able to perhaps choose negative and positive traits to form some unique classes sounds like a blast, especially if you can take those into online play.\n\nOnline play itself right now is a hit and miss. While the game does have a listing showing who is playing and whether their game is private or public, connection issues are standard and the game is suited probably best for playing with a close knit group of friends. This may change before the game hits final release. There is also a \u201cSeed\u201d npc which I imagine will allow you to share with others for Binding of Isaac type of action. This feature is currently locked as well.\n\nFinally on more of the development side of things, Streets of Rogue now has a publisher, Tinybuild. This is fantastic news for the future of Streets of Rogue as this gives the developer more time to focus on finishing the game. While I may be a bit biased towards Tinybuild for whats it worth, they\u2019re an excellent publisher and I have worked with them many times. You may know Tinybuild for publishing amazing titles such as Punch Club, The Final Station, Clustertruck, and Speedrunners.\n\nThe future is looking bright for Streets of Rogue, if you are on the fence about whether or not you want to get this game, I highly recommend it. As it stands in its current Early Access state, I have played this game many, many times. It\u2019s well made and the developer is constantly taking feedback. I just can\u2019t wait to see the final product and lead the Resistance to victory or more realistically blow everything up.", "timestamp_created": 1493266903, "timestamp_updated": 1493266976, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500632", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "31386847": {"recommendationid": "31386847", "author": {"steamid": "76561198194598245", "num_games_owned": 78, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 2274, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510334152}, "language": "english", "review": "Streets of Rogue is a (you guessed it) rogue-lite that offers unlimited amounts of replayability.

Most older roguelikes had some element that would force the player to look through their inventory, their skills, or the dungeon itself to find a way to get around an enemy that was too powerful to defeat. [u]J[/u]umping over a pit trap you found earlier, [u]D[/u]rinking from a fountain and hoping desperately that it'll do something to save you from the angry horse that's been chasing you down the corridor, or [u]Z[/u]apping the right wand at the right time. There was always at least one moment (and if you played as a Tourist, every moment) where fighting the monsters was just not the right move.\n\nThat's something that seems to have fallen by the wayside in the new generation of roguelikes, but it is central to Streets of Rogue's gameplay. Each stage gives you a set of missions to complete, and often these missions don't require you to kill anyone. Have a mission to steal an object from a building full of armed guards? You could always kick in the door and try to fight them all, but you could also tamper with the air conditioner to spread a sedative through the building. Maybe you could decide to knock on the windows, and then sucker punch the guards one by one as they come to check out the noise. Maybe you've got more money than you really need, you could hire a few of the hobos around town to follow you around. When they fight the security guards, you sneak through the fracas and steal the object.\n\nStreets of Rogue evokes the days when a roguelike meant a game where every key on the keyboard was a command, but it manages to keep everything contained with context menus and a mouse-interface.", "timestamp_created": 1492927928, "timestamp_updated": 1492927928, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499081", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "31312911": {"recommendationid": "31312911", "author": {"steamid": "76561198281799580", "num_games_owned": 75, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3977, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511613950}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u597d \u73a9", "timestamp_created": 1492927541, "timestamp_updated": 1492927541, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "31312359": {"recommendationid": "31312359", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021919433", "num_games_owned": 319, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 260, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508901779}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun, pretty addicting, and the amount of different ways you can play it is awesome.", "timestamp_created": 1492924641, "timestamp_updated": 1492924641, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "31310627": {"recommendationid": "31310627", "author": {"steamid": "76561198351690179", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 510, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501058579}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4e00\u7b50\u975e\u5e38\u4e0d\u9519\uff0c\u4e14\u6781\u6613\u4e0a\u624b\u7684\u6e38\u620f\n\u65e2\u53ef\u4ee5\u89d2\u8272\u626e\u6f14\uff0c\u53c8\u53ef\u4ee5\u95ef\u5173\n\u641c\u96c6\u9053\u5177\uff0c\u5f3a\u5316\u6280\u80fd\uff0c\u975e\u5e38\u559c\u6b22\u8fd9\u7c7b\u6e38\u620f\n\u2014\u2014by Eurus", "timestamp_created": 1492915831, "timestamp_updated": 1492915831, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "31310435": {"recommendationid": "31310435", "author": {"steamid": "76561198380119993", "num_games_owned": 12, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3348, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 17, "last_played": 1513367230}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8fd9\u771f\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u597d\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u73a9\u513f\u7740\u73a9\u513f\u7740\u5c31\u5165\u8ff7\u4e86\uff0c\u4e70\u5f97\u503c\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1492914960, "timestamp_updated": 1492914960, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "31308548": {"recommendationid": "31308548", "author": {"steamid": "76561198107235756", "num_games_owned": 40, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 135, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494815805}, "language": "english", "review": "ok", "timestamp_created": 1492905962, "timestamp_updated": 1492905962, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497512", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "31307956": {"recommendationid": "31307956", "author": {"steamid": "76561198089842336", "num_games_owned": 211, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 3909, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 10, "last_played": 1513292866}, "language": "english", "review": "I haved 100%d the game.

You make your way through randomly generated maps with randomly generated tasks while it's always left upon you how to approach them.\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\n\nAt the beginning of each playthrough you must pick one of many different characters which have a big impact on the way you will play the game as each of these characters have unique abilities and advantages. \nLet's take the doctor as an example,\nwhen playing as the doctor you are unable to wield any weapons but you can disable people from behind with clorophorm. This forces you to focus on stealth instead of relying on weaponry like you probably would with the soldier character.\nAfter picking your character you enter a randomly generated map with many different buildings and npcs while most of the npcs are representations of the characters you get to choose from. There are also objectives randomly genereated for  each map which vary from \"eliminate this guy\" to \"rescue that guy\". Most tasks can be solved in different ways. You can use violence and just kill everybody or you could persuade or bribe people to get to your objective. The freedom of choice in how you tackle your objectives is what makes this game so great in my opinion.\n\nAs of right now there is a little lack of content as there are only two different areas playable but there are more to be added. The content right now offers enough replayability by giving you the possibility to add mutators and play daily challenges.\n\n[b]Soundtrack[/b]\n\nThis game offers unique and good soundtracks varying for each stage. Nothing bad to say here in my opinion.\n\n[b]Performance[/b]\n\nI'm playing this game on the following specs:\n\nGigabyte GTX1070\nI7-3770\n12 GB DDR3 RAM\n\nIt runs smooth most of the time. I've encountered some performance problems in the Industrial area when there were too many effects and particles at the same time visible on the screen.\n\nI can't say anything about the multiplayer as I have not tried it yet.\n\n[b]Conclusion[/b]\n\nAwesome game for anybody who loves Rogue-like games.

Simple and addictive.  In early stages and has a lot of room to grow. \n\nSeem to have issues going onto the steam forum so escuse me for having to use the review for a few ideas to help improve on the game.\n\nOne potential bug in tutorial is not walking through the first red laser to not get a rock to toss through the second laser.  if you use a bat and swing you will find yourself stuck as you walk through the second lasor and being stuck in that section.  Just skip the tutorial and try it again if this occurs.  \n\nRespecting it is in early stages still some of the stuff I think would be very cool to eventually see.  I want to start with improving character that you play leveling, where even if you die certain stats and traits will stick around allowing you to do more and more making your run throughs a lot easier.  I would like to see some other character aspects that lend more to stealth or communication skills to get though levels.\n\nCharacter ideas to see eventually.\nHypnotiser, or Jedi.  You hypnotise people to honor task.  ie. store owner opens the safe for you.  give you the needed item of choice and counts as paid, etc.  \n\nElectrician.  You host orders by \"the mayor\" to provide a routine check up and you socialize to complete objectives \"working\" on various equipment, computers, etc.  \n\nShadow.  You are cloaked and undetectable in darkness.  Using tranquilizer darts to put people to sleep un notice.  A true stealth character.  Basically you are screwed if you get caught being agile only to remain hidden.\n\nFor Friday the 13th and Halloween time.  Jason.  You have 10000 hp and an unbreakable machette, only goal is to kill everyone every level for as long as you can.\n\nNot sure of a name but similar to jason but with the rocket launcher.  Maybe a cyborg character.  letting people get their mass destruction out of their systems.  \n\nI would guess allowing an easy, normal, and hard mode would not be too bad of an idea so people can get a good feel for what to do and how to do it.  \n\nIf you can get this game, absolutely do so.

In a market flooded with games with strikingly similar premises, Streets of Rogue sets itself apart by giving you an unrelenting amount of freedom in the way you choose to tackle the objectives you're given each level. This \"Nuclear Throne meets Deus Ex\" gameplay meshes very well with the variety of characters to choose from, from the pacifist Doctor, to the rutheless (and illiterate) Jock, assuring each run will be wildly different from the last if you swap characters. \n\nHow have I gone this far into the review without mentioning the co op. The ENTIRE game is playable with up to 4 people, and is honestly the best way to play the game, in my opinion. While some characters may be a bit lacking in singleplayer, they excel well with another player to fill in your shortcomings. Absolutely a blast. My favorite thing about Streets of Rogue is probably the dedicated developer. Matt Dabrowski's passion for this game is unparelleled, with frequent updates and constant community reachout.

The game is a nice take on the rogue-like genre making and open world game that gives you more freedom in the way you do things and when you want to. This is also increased with the fact that you have many different characters that are very different and have specific traits that others don't have. There a character named the doctor who has a trait where you can chloriform people from going behind them and then theres a character where you hack technology from long range; I recommend you hack a fridge. It might be running away; also the variety of items and how you can get them in-game is great; even though I really hope the creators add more variety in missions because you either kill someone, \"retrieve\" an item, destroy a thing, and thats all really. This also added to the slightly same maps almost every playthrough.\n\nMany times I have seen maps with similar to basically the same map because there is quite low quality of enemy bases, homes, stores, and other places that if had better, different sized, and randomness; the freedom you have to do the missions would be used better and in many ways. Giving a more fun and satisfying feeling when doing missions. This would also help all the characters be played on an equal playing field; the thief is so good in this game! It can go through wall and get into areas that you aren't allowed to go into super easily and this I don't like that its so much better almost every other class. The wrestler, the jock, the hacker, the doctor, the cop and the vampire; just some classes that seem to have a harder time to do the things that the thief, assassin, and shapeshifter do better when they for their core weren't made for that. This can be fixed with more opportunities to interact with characters and better map design. Which I completly feel that the creator is doing and continue to update this game. Though theres one more thing to talk about; the multiplayer that highly increases the fun of the game and fixes one of the problems I spoke about.\n\nThe problem that is fixed is that many characters become viable in the multiplayer environment because the game makes characters synergize really well and fun. This is because with multiple people more actions are possible to get some of the classes to work well. I can give a great example of this; me and my friend Terra played together and we really like stealth and gameplay where we don't get caught. So we did a two man team of of thief and doctor. Now, you might be saying \"wait isn't the thiedf really strong like you said\" yes, yes it is but, we used the strength of both of these classes to make them work. So Terra knocked on the door of a room, I waited and when an enemy i walked behind them and chloriformed them. This is way better than waiting for them for the person to turn around because they close the door and you can mess up the trait. There are many synergies in this game and you can have up to 4 people in the game so its crazy how strong classes can be alone and that's why I really like the multiplayer. So from the great things about the game and the problem here should you buy the game?

I would have lost my marbles if this came out when I was a teenager. Even with a limited amount of levels at this point in development, not only are all the elements of long term playability present, but a game of 5 levels can be a long and interesting afffair. A lot of games that have the rogue-like tag in their description claim that all kinds of \"wacky\" things can happen. While this can be true, a lot of those games rely on some serious skill and dedication to game mastery in order for that to happen. While I am certainly one who is capable of that due to years of playing rogue-likes and hybrids, it can be frustrating to have to do so in order to enjoy a game when one is on a busy work or life schedule. Streets of Rogue is interesting and allows for a quick understanding of the mechanics but will play out into a varied and multi-faceted experience the more you immerse yourself in the game. The light hearted, seemigly instant gratification element of the game doesn't hide, but precludes an already highly developed game with much to do and many possibilites. I look forward to the continued development and will continue to play. Some pros: 1. Action is balanced and fun. Traits and items play into your success, but your reflexes play an equal part. As of now, the game doesn't skew you one way or another.  This is optimal. 2. Classes present a somewhat unique experience and reward you for tailoring gameplay to a particular class, although you always have the option to just fuck everything up if you're fast enough not to die. 3. The home base with permanent or semi permanent upgrades and the chicken nugget currency are not an original addition to such a game, but a welcome one that will certainly reward multiple playthroughs. A list of cons is not necessary, because I don't really have any complaints worth mentioning. This game has more packed into early access than a lot of AAA games do on offocial release.

You can play the stealth role, sneak into places, crack safes, pick locks, cut your way through windows... you can also drop a cyanide pill into an air conditioner to murder everyone in the building. Never said stealthy had to be pacifistic.\n\nCombat is super fast paced, but not all that complex. Melee is basically a lot of moving around, trying to get into range and hit the enemy and then backing off so you're not hit in return. It can be quite hectic when you've angered several NPC's at once. Guns are a lot more dangerous and require quick reflexes to try and avoid (though something like a shotgun will generally hit you regardless). All weapons have limited uses, with melee weapons breaking after a while and guns running out of ammo. A big part of the game is figuring out when combat is worth the risk.\n\nThere are various missions that you will get on each stage. These can involve stealing an item (either from a safe or an NPC directly). Rescuing prisoners. Destroying targets. Sometimes it's simple, other times you'll spend ages trying to figure out how to get around security. Completing missions earns you rewards, failing them simply ends them. To complete a stage you have to finish or fail all the missions given. Though there are sometimes secondary objectives as well.\n\nThere's a lot of characters to unlock and choose from.

I\u2019m Weise, aka Thomas, and I\u2019d like to welcome you, to the Streets of Rogue, a new game developed by Matt Dabrowski and published by Tiny Build Games. Available on Steam for $14.99, together, we can join the resistance and take down the mayor in this action-packed, co-op, rogue-like experience like no-other.\n\n[h1][b]Storyline[/b][/h1]\n\nYou are a member of the resistance, a semi-organized group of rebels trying to take down the corrupt mayor and take back the city. After running a campaign full of deceit, the crime rate in the city has skyrocketed and the resistance wants to bring back order, by any means necessary. You cannot let anyone get in the way of your cause as you travel through the Streets of Rogue.\n\n[h1][b]Gameplay[/b][/h1]\n\nThe typical flow of the game has you progress floor by floor through the city, in a procedurally generated world. Each floor will assign you a random set of missions to complete that could include murdering someone, acquiring a specific item, rescuing a prisoner, or more all in order to help the resistance with their cause. You must use any means necessary to complete the mission, making use of whatever special skills your character has.\n\nYou start each round by picking a class that you\u2019ll use until you die. These classes include both typical and VERY, untypical characters. For example, you can play as the soldier, a class that starts with various weapons and armor if that\u2019s your play style. Or maybe you prefer to take a stealth approach with the Hacker, tampering with computers and using your hacker skills to benefit you. Perhaps you\u2019d rather be a gorilla and just smash everything with heavy melee attacks. Truly, this game lets you play however you like as you approach each scenario you\u2019re given, assessing the situation, and determining the best route you want to try to take to accomplish the goal.\n\nAs you complete certain achievements, you\u2019ll unlock additional characters too. For example, if you bribe a certain number of cops, you can unlock the police officer as a playable character. I found this to be a fun way to get me back into the game for replay ability, trying to tackle one or two character unlocks each run. You earn a currency that looks like a potato based on the progression you made in each run as well that can be used at the home base or HUB area to unlock more skills, weapons, and mission rewards to use in the future. Truly, it\u2019s a fun gameplay mechanic that just doesn\u2019t get old.\n\nFinally, to wrap this section up, the game allows you to play with up to 3 other people in a co-op medley. Combine your skills to form the ultimate team and be able to handle any situation that comes at you.\n\n[h1][b]Visuals[/b][/h1]\n\nVisually, this game isn\u2019t too much to look at. It\u2019s very much a pixel-art game and though its done decently, there\u2019s nothing that set it apart too much for me. Some of the character customization is fun to play with, and the character classes themselves have some extra detail, but in the current version of the world the environments felt a tad more lacking for me. Due to the nature of the procedurally generated levels, it\u2019s very easy to see the various textures and patterns being reused to form the buildings. This isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing, and really is quite expected, but it is something to note.\n\nI will say that I found the procedural generation to be great however, in that rooms of all different kinds, sizes, etc were found in each playthrough and every floor which really added to the environment of this scummy city you are trying to free.\n\n[h1][b]Audio/Dialog[/b][/h1]\n\nThe soundtrack for Streets of Rogue is pretty fantastic, and you can actually purchase it as DLC in the Steam store for $2.99. It fits the feel of the gameplay perfectly. All the dialog in the game is text-based, but the sound effects for the various weapons, doors, glass breaking and more really are great. Voice acting in a game like this isn\u2019t really needed, but the script writing they did for the different interactions is actually quite good. The tutorial at the start of the game sets the tone, full of humor and jokes that continue to come up throughout the game. Overall, my expectations in the audio department weren\u2019t too high and I was pleased with what I found.\n\n[h1][b]Replay-ability[/b][/h1]\n\nThere are a lot of unlockables in this game, and its still in early-access. I\u2019ve mentioned the unlockable characters, but you can also unlock weapons and gadgets for rewards from missions, various traits for when you level up, and much more. Additionally, there is a plan to allow for seeds to be entered, daily-runs for leaderboards, various mutators which will change the way the game is played, and a create a character feature to allow you to create your own custom class.\nThe mutators alone change the gameplay drastically. You can handicap yourself with things like \u201cmelee only\u201d or just change the game up by having all the citizens riot in the streets. Combine this with the procedural generation and multiplayer and you have a game you can come back to over and over.\n\n[h1][b]Overall Wrap-Up[/b][/h1]\n\nOverall, I really like Streets of Rogue. At the time of this review, I have eight hours into it and have unlocked almost all the characters. I have plenty of traits and mission rewards to unlock still and have only scratched the surface of testing myself on daily runs or with various mutators turned on. For $15, the Tiny Build name behind the publishing, and the ability to play with up to three of my friends for even more mayhem, I cannot recommend this game enough if you are even the slightest bit a fan of rogue-like RPG action games.

Det er sv\u00e6rt at stoppe et selskab der er s\u00e5 villige til at tage chancer med de mest m\u00e6rkelige spil. Den seneste titel der kommer fra selskabet er Matt Dabrowski\u2019s mega RPG action brawling stealth shooter Streets Of Rogue.\n\nDu v\u00e6lger ud fra stort udvalg af forskellige figurer, der enten kan blande sig,- eller skille sig ud fra menneskem\u00e6ngden. Du starter din mission i et slumkvarter og blive bedt om at udf\u00f8re et s\u00e6t missioner for at rydde omr\u00e5det. Disse kan sp\u00e6nde fra at indsamle informationer, til at befri fanger, eller fjerne den lokale narkobaron der husere i kvarteret. Spillet kombinerer en masse forskellige aspekter. Til at starte med indeholder spillet flere RPG elementer, det sker bl.a. i form af levels som din karakter stiger efterh\u00e5nden som du f\u00e5r fuldf\u00f8rt forskellige missioner. Dette vil resultere i mere health gennem din exp, som du skal bruge for at kunne blive l\u00e6ngere i kamp og f\u00e5 mere erfaring. Det er ogs\u00e5 et spil der indeholder brawler elementer, som udtrykkes kraftigt med alle de forskellige v\u00e5ben du l\u00f8bende samler op og alle de slagsm\u00e5l du kommer i, som oftest involvere mange mennesker. Der er bestemt ogs\u00e5 store stealth elementer i spillet, som fx n\u00e5r du f\u00e5r adgang til udstyr der g\u00f8r det muligt at hacke de forskellige computere og servere, der alle kan indeholde informationer der kan bidrage til at du n\u00e5r dine m\u00e5l. Alt sammen er pakket dejligt ind, i det der ligner et klassisk 16-bit dungeon crawler spil.\n\nSamlet set er Streets Of Rogue faktisk et ret fedt spil. Der er meget her for at elske. Dialogen i spillet er underholdende eftersom at du bliver behandlet som en \u00e6gte ballademager. Mit problem med det at d\u00f8 er klart spillets minus, men samtidig giver det ogs\u00e5 den slags udfordring, som kan provokere de mere hardcore spillere til at fors\u00f8ge at gennemf\u00f8re spillet med en karakter i et enkelt fors\u00f8g. Plus der er en masse forskellige karakterer der kan l\u00e5ses op for, alle med deres egne s\u00e6rlige f\u00e6rdigheder, s\u00e5 der er helt klart masser af genspilnings muligheder hvilket absolut forst\u00e6rker mine positive tanker om spillet.

However, with disregard to the unreleased features considering this is Alpha, here is what I have to say:\n\nPros:\n- Every level is randomly generated so you'll never feel like you're playing the same level over and over again\n- It's not a pay-to-play game. Thank Bruce Almighty\n- You have good amount of options in character choice that you get to unlock and play. (Compared to \"race\" in other RPG's that determines player skillsets)\n- Humor. Great reason to play a game. Type? Not a professional of literature, comedy, or entertainment in general; but I'd say satire, juvenile(child-like humor), morbid, and other uncanny things. Ex. You taking a giant pill, walking through a wall, and everybody exploding when you punch them. Satisfying and hilarious lol\n- Mutations keep the game interesting after you've defeated much of everything. Similar to Bungie's Halo skulls in campaign where you can turn a feature on like \"Cowbell\", giving \"more bang for your buck\", or in other words bigger explosions.\n- There's so much randomly unconceived and unperceived wackiness. I wish there was more commentary to the game besides the tutorial and pixel-bubble story line. \n\nCons:\n- Because it's still in alpha, many features aren't released, but I don't know if you would or wouldn't include this as a con or a side note.\n- If you're playing by yourself, it isn't much fun once you've unlocked everything\n- Character customization is moderately limited in cosmetic features( i.e. hair, hair color, facial hair )\n- Unlocked all the characters, except one, in under 2 hours. Should be irritatingly difficult to get ALL characters unlocked. Also, you can't customize all of the characters.\n- The skills you have to unlock with \"nuggets\", or what I'd like to call expendable skill points, are limited. There's the cool idea of unlocking 2 abilities which reveals a locked ability, but right now there's less than a double digit number; \n\nIMO\n- Sadly, once you die you must restart from level 1-1. I don't know how far the levels go up to because I've only reached 2-x, but I wish there was an option or feature to begin where you've died or started off last in the base. If there is this feature. WHERE?!\n- Girlfriend didn't want to buy the game because it was too expensive. I don't want to buy another game because it's too expensive (for what it is)\n- fun game overall. I'd buy it if the price was lowered, on sale, or a dozen or so more features were added making it playable for long periods of time alone.", "timestamp_created": 1490496640, "timestamp_updated":

Il gameplay consiste nel superare dei livelli in citt\u00e0 generate casualmente dove si potranno usare diversi personaggi... ed \u00e8 qui che arriva il bello! Ogni personaggio cambia il gameplay e ha abilit\u00e0 uniche che fanno scegliere al giocatore l'approccio alla missione che pensa sia il migliore. Un esempio \u00e8 che usando il soldato partiremo subito ben armati ma per esempio se si prende l'hacker si rinuncia alle armi in cambio dell'abilit\u00e0 di poter hackerare dalla distanza per avvantaggiarci magari togliendo le trappole. Non mancano anche i personaggi piu strani, come il vampiro che \u00e8 invisibile alle telecamere o ancora lo scienziato che ha armi come il laser di ghiaccio o la pasticca che lo fa diventare gigante. Ad oggi il gioco ha pochi livelli ma comunque consiglio l'acquisto perch\u00e8 il gioco promette bene ed ha gia una grande variet\u00e0 di personaggi (non so il numero preciso ma dovrebbero essere sui 15) . Con gli aggiornamenti verranno introdotti (a detta degli sviluppatori) Nuove funzioni come quella di creare il proprio personaggio e verranno aggiunti nuovi livelli e missioni. Detto questo ho grandi speranze per questo gioco che \u00e8 gia molto valido.

Shapeshifter is my favorite.    \n\nCharacters all have different traits, ranging from l33t hacking skills, Recruiting more people, stubby fingers that cant operate firearms, Being a \"scrawny nerdlinger\" who's easy to push around, and also a \"Drug-a-lug\" who knows what all of that good stuff does... there's more- but that's a decent summary.\n\nA few charaters even have special skills, like ramming enemies, tossing objects, telling jokes, camoflage to hide from pursuit, and all out possesion of the npc's.\n\nGameplay wise-\n\nYou have to progress by completing missons on each floor, after that you are allowed to exit through the staircase.\nThe missions are all pretty simplistic such as \"Retrieve an item\" or \"Neutralize a Target\" and  \"Free the prisoners.\"\nBut the variation comes in when you choose your method on to accomplish your goal, and it's fun to experiment character traits might effect that even.\n\nOnly 2 zones for now, but also still has \"endless\" for if you want to keep going, there is also disasters at the end of each zone, like the killer robot who wants to hunt you down or the periodic radiation blast that can kill anyone who stays outdoors a bit too long, and the bombs falling from the sky that oddly only fall when your around. Just my luck, amiright?\n\n\nAll in all, I would reccomend it, but if you want to wait that is fine, as the game is still pretty early in.\nhas pretty frequent updates, but it's just one guy to my knowledge so content wont be added THAT fast.\nIt does have multiplayer, both couch co-op and online multiplayer, if you're looking for that.\nI feel like Im leaving something out, and I'm not quite doing this game justice.\n\nIt's pretty darn fun, try it.", "timestamp_created": 1490413038, "timestamp_updated": 1490413038, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30716550": {"recommendationid": "30716550", "author": {"steamid": "76561198143535040", "num_games_owned": 76, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 2428, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495984316}, "language": "english", "review": "Hilarious and tons of fun, Highly reccomended.", "timestamp_created": 1490405737, "timestamp_updated": 1490405737, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30716408": {"recommendationid": "30716408", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066620823", "num_games_owned": 369, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 307, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489346066}, "language": "german", "review": "Ich konnte das Spiel kostenlos testen ! \n\nAlso das spiel ist trotz zufalls generieter map ziemlich repetitiv.\nAllerdings bietet das spiel 17 charactere die man in laufe des spiels freischalten kann die sich alle sehr unterschiedlich spielen.Ob man jetzt mit dem soldaten alles zerschie\u00dft oder als hacker nichtmal das geb\u00e4ude betreten muss um die mission zu l\u00f6sen.Das ganze wird dann noch mit items vers\u00fcsst.Es ist aber in seiner machart als rogue-like  einzigartig so kannst du im prinzip auch sehr weit kommen ohne irgendjemanden zu t\u00f6ten.So musst du zb ein item besorgen dass, von einer person getragen wird ob du ihn bet\u00e4ubst,t\u00f6test oder bezahlst ist dir \u00fcberlassen und so kann man viele (leider nicht alle) missionen l\u00f6sen du hast die freiheit zu entscheiden wie du es machst.\n\nWie auch immer ich w\u00fcrde es mir f\u00fcr 15\u20ac kaufen.\n\n+einzigartig in der machart \n+sehr viel abwechslung in den Characteren \n+jzt schon viel zum freischalten\n=deutsche \u00fcbersetzung ist in ordnung \n-repetitiver levelaufbau\n-zum zeitpunkt an dem ich es spielen konnte waren nur 2 ebenen freigeschaltet (slum und industriegebiet)", "timestamp_created": 1490405108, "timestamp_updated": 1490405108, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30716275": {"recommendationid": "30716275", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063264505", "num_games_owned": 13, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 434, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489375934}, "language": "english", "review": "Very good game.

There are shops, bars, prisons, gang hideouts, arcades, homes, slave shops, and more. It is more akin to something found in an RPG or open-world sandbox game than your average roguelike.\nThat similarity to open-world games extends beyond the environments, and into the gameplay as well. When you enter a given level of the city, you are assigned a few tasks, which can vary greatly. How you accomplish that task is entirely up to you. Like an open-world game, you have complete freedom to do as you wish, and there are numerous ways to accomplish any given task. Each level is basically a small sandbox in which to play. If you have to free a prisoner, for example, you have a variety of options at your disposal. You could go in guns blazing and kill the abductors, or hack into their security system to unlock the cells, or bribe them with money or alcohol, or pretty much anything else you can think of.\n\nOf course, your best course of action will probably depend largely upon your character/class. There is a pretty large cast of diverse characters to choose from, some of which must be unlocked by meeting certain criteria during your playthroughs. Each class has unique attributes, skills, starting equipment, and strengths and weaknesses.  The soldier, with his health regeneration and arsenal of weapons, lends himself to an aggressive playstyle. The doctor, on the other hand, is better served by avoiding combat due to his inability to use weapons, although he can sneak up on people to knock them out with chloroform. The investment banker starts with a large sum of money and has the ability to borrow more from any merchant or shop owner, but also has a drug addiction that constantly drains his health until he gets his fix.\"\n...\n(S)treets of Rogue is a fresh and inventive take on roguelikes. It shares as much in common with the likes of Deus Ex as it does with, say, Binding of Isaac, combining elements of roguelikes, RPG's, and even open-world games. The distinctive setting and environments, the diverse inhabitants of the city and the fact that they aren't hostile by default, and the open-ended nature of how to approach any given situation, combine to make it feel like something new and completely unique. I've enjoyed every single foray that I've made to The City, and i plan on making many more.\"\n\nPlease check out the full review at:   http://thecrankymessiah.com/streets-of-rogue-review/", "timestamp_created": 1490064702, "timestamp_updated": 1491083742, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.475207", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30644824": {"recommendationid": "30644824", "author": {"steamid": "76561198360318407", "num_games_owned": 28, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 120, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489359991}, "language": "english", "review": "i liked it", "timestamp_created": 1490060212, "timestamp_updated": 1490060212, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30644360": {"recommendationid": "30644360", "author": {"steamid": "76561197988579258", "num_games_owned": 493, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 215, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494116302}, "language": "english", "review": "Recommended Chaotic Fun for the Rogue-lite lover.", "timestamp_created": 1490057168, "timestamp_updated": 1490057168, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30643910": {"recommendationid": "30643910", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037324067", "num_games_owned": 135, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 906, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501265254}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041a\u0430\u043a \u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443 \u0432 \u0442\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043c \u0441\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u044f\u043d\u0438\u0438?\n1 \u0438\u0437 5 \u043a\u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0432 - \u0432\u044b \u0441\u0435\u0440\u044c\u0451\u0437\u043d\u043e?\n\u041f\u043e\u043a\u0430 \u0431\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043d\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0437\u044f.", "timestamp_created": 1490054614, "timestamp_updated": 1490054614, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.317963", "comment_count": "10", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30643566": {"recommendationid": "30643566", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013001990", "num_games_owned": 316, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 1610, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500201141}, "language": "english", "review": "stage one : take a chance \n\nStage two : ???\n\nStage three : proffit", "timestamp_created": 1490052536, "timestamp_updated": 1490052536, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30643236": {"recommendationid": "30643236", "author": {"steamid": "76561197979797884", "num_games_owned": 263, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 251, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490652438}, "language": "english", "review": "I can't recommend this game AT THE MOMENT (alpha 20f)\n\n+ It's Fun\n+ artstyle\n+ game Idea\n+ Classes\n\n- Value for Money (pretty short for 15\u20ac)\n- Internet multiplayer is very laggy\n- can be buggy (connection issues every 5 games)\n- no real balancing\n\njust wait don't buy yet... this game has potential!", "timestamp_created": 1490050902, "timestamp_updated": 1490051367, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513440", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30641499": {"recommendationid": "30641499", "author": {"steamid": "76561198278020954", "num_games_owned": 35, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 262, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489308553}, "language": "english", "review": "I don't like roguelikes, I don't like pixel graphics, and yet I like this game.

The game has unlimited possibilities and opportunities, which gives you endless ways to attack each mission.  Each level is randomly generated so you will never play the same level more then once.  I was giving an Alpha edition to review so all the missions that I was given were randomly generated without any actual story line to follow.  Story line or \u201cBig Quests\u201d, as they are called in the game are going to be appearing at a later date, which makes the depth of the game at this early stage in development that much more impressive!\n\nThe staggering number of options that you have at your disposal is one of the major aspects of this game.  Items that you can pick up and use, the ridiculous ways you can approach a mission and the many different ways you can interact with your environment, give this game a depth and replayability that is often not seen in Indie games. The other critical aspect of the Streets of Rogue is the emergent nature of the game play.  This is because of the fantastic AI characters.  They all act on their own, which creates many different situations for you.  The way they interact with the player, the environment and other AI characters leads to truly hysterical moments.  Streets of Rogue has done an incredible job combining both of these elements which leads to an amazing game with endless situations and endless game play.  You have so many different ways to approach each situations and every one of them is challenging, and most importantly loads of fun\n\nstreets of rogue\nstreets of rogue\nAt it\u2019s core, the goals of the game are pretty simple: On each floor, you are given 2 to 3 missions. These appear on your map screen, and there are a variety of different objectives that each mission can be comprised of. Each floor is almost like a small town, with a variety of different buildings filled with all sorts of things, and each individual mission will always be given it\u2019s own building. Once you\u2019ve completed the required missions, you can then access the elevator that takes you to the next floor. Each mission also gives you a variety of possible rewards, and some floors will contain a character that can offer you a totally optional mission as well.\n\nMissions differ in how they work, including ones that have the same objective.  For example lets say your current mission involves neutralizing a character.  The character could be inside of a well protected building with guards, cameras, and trip mines or he could simply be a shop owner and just be sitting behind his desk.  Your first thought would be that the shop owner is an easy kill, but he probably has a high powered shotgun at his disposal, as well as other thugs in the store.  You blow up the walls and come in that way, or you could use stealth or maybe even become a vampire and bite him from behind.  The opportunities are endless. Your schemes will not always work out. There are loads of people in this bizarre city, each with their own agenda, and they can often screw up your plans in ways that you never expected, bringing you new troubles and causing chaos, adding to the emergent nature of the game play in a very dynamic and fun way. And you have tons of different ways of interacting with all these characters. Hire some goons to do your dirty work, or even bribe the cops on the current floor to ignore your crimes for awhile, among tons of other options.\n\nWhen all else fails, pure combat is the only answer!  Thankfully, the shooting/combat system in Streets of Rogue is fantastic.  You move your player with the keyboard while the mouse acts as your aiming sights.  This concept gives you versatility while running away or strafing your enemies, while still allowing you to fire back from any angle.  There are numerous melee weapons to use.  The normal ones are there such as punch, knife, and bat, but you can also come across battle axs, swords, police batons and many more insane weapons. The same can be said about all the guns in the game there is a huge variety of guns and most are way over the top!  You also have the ability of using grenades, land mines and other explosives.  These explosives add aspect to the missions because they allows you to blow up most walls, giving you straight path to your objective.\n\nstreets of rogue\nstreets of rogue\nYou gain XP for completing missions and many other things.  Gaining XP allows you to give your character a new trait.  These traits give your player different abilities ranging from paying less at the store, to making ugly faces during combat which ends up scaring your enemies.  You can also activate mutators that change the game in a huge way.  These range from having very low health to other crazy ideas like no ammo.\n\nThe character selection is very diverse in the game and allows you many options.  You could play as a soldier, who has extra health and many guns or you could play as a doctor who isn\u2019t allowed to use weapons. My favorite character is Dracula, his signature trait allows you the ability of biting other characters to regain health.  Each character has a different feel to them and changes your approaching significantly.  Fortunately they are all a blast to play with and it truly shows the creativity of the developers.\n\nStreets of Rogue is a fantastic game that I would highly recommend.

My fine travel laptop will do without.\n\nHowever, I have purchased this game FIVE times (for friends, and once accidently. Ping me if you want my accidental gift copy I still have). Two of those times they don't work due to the pink screen bug., the answer to which is \"your gfx card is not compatible\" or some driver issue.

Tiene tanto, pero tanto por hacer, por ver, muchas cosas por experimentar a la hora de realizar misiones, cosas muy chistosas, di\u00e1logos que nos har\u00e1n re\u00edr, es simplemente fant\u00e1stico.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upZTWlJ3MjM\n\nStreets of Rogue es un t\u00edtulo rogue-lite que se centra en la libertad del jugador para hacer lo que quiera a la hora de enfrentar los distintos escenarios, un juego de acci\u00f3n,  de arte en pixeles, creado por una sola persona al que se le nota el esfuerzo puesto con el \u00fanico fin de entretener a los jugadores.\n\nEl desarrollador comenta tener inspiraci\u00f3n de t\u00edtulos como The Binding of Isaac, pero dotando al jugador la posibilidad de jugar como quiera, le deja experimentar utilizando las distintas mec\u00e1nicas, con elementos de rol (al estilo Deus Ex) o creando un caos total (un poco de GTA) destruyendo cosas o haciendo a\u00f1icos a quien se le ponga en frente.\n\nTodo esto, sin tener calabozos, en su lugar tenemos ciudades generadas proceduralmente totalmente funcionales, coo una IA muy bien trabajada, con NPCs que se dedicar\u00e1n a hacer sus actividades diarias normalmente. Para progresar, el jugador necesitar\u00e1 completar desafios o misiones espec\u00edficas, claro, de la manera que considere conveniente mediante el uso de las habilidades del personaje que elija -podemos escoger dentro de una lista de hasta 15 personajes, cada uno con habilidades especiales, art\u00edculos distintivos de su estilo, con la posibilidad de desbloquear nuevos objetos y ventajas al final de cada nivel. \n\nLa peque\u00f1a trama del juego nos cuenta -mientras nos ense\u00f1a como jugar, c\u00f3mo fuimos aceptados como miembros de la Resistencia, un grupo local que se ha levantado en contra del nuevo Mayor de la ciudad, un personaje vil, que nadie quiere. Tras el tutorial que nos muestra los conceptos b\u00e1sicos del juego (en poco tiempo) con mucho humor, que nos hace ver lo divertido que sera este titulo, somos enviados al cuartel general de La Resistencia, estando en dicho lugar, podemos comenzar a jugar.\n \nHablando de nuevo de los personajes, podemos escoger entre muchos, adem\u00e1s de sus habilidades, podemos cambiar su aspecto f\u00edsico, su estilo y color de cabello, tipo de bello facial, o el color de la piel. \n\nAprender a jugar es sencill\u00edsimo; el juego tiene una vista top-down. Despu\u00e9s del tutorial nos explican que la ciudad est\u00e1 construida \u201cen capas como una lasagna\u201d, y que debemos empezar nuestra cacer\u00eda (o golpe de estado) desde \u201cabajo\u201d, en los barrios bajos, hasta llegar a la parte high class, en la cima de la ciudad, donde se encuentra el Mayor. Existen modos multijugador, local o en l\u00ednea, aun que de momento, el juego en l\u00ednea no es funcional.\n\nLo mejor de Streets of Rogue es la cantidad de situaciones en las que podemos meternos gracias a que cada mapa tiene muchas casas o edificios para buscar objetos, dinero, cajas fuertes, y muchos personajes no jugables que andar\u00e1n por ah\u00ed, dispuestos a darnos una mano, o a sucumbir bajo nuestras garras, las posibilidades se limitan a la imaginaci\u00f3n del jugador.  Entre los NPC\u2019s, encontramos cient\u00edficos que nos ayudaran a identificar objetos raros que encontremos por ah\u00ed, nos toparemos con \u201ccomerciantes\u201d que venden sustancias il\u00edcitas, las cuales nos dan peque\u00f1os pluses en las habilidades a la hora de realizar misiones.\nEl modo multijugador es probablemente lo mejor.\n\nAlgunos edificios pueden ser habitados por mafiosos y si queremos entrar a lootear ha de ser por la fuerza, o simplemente por diversi\u00f3n aunque no sea parte de nuestra misi\u00f3n. Hay muchos NPC\u2019s con los cuales pelear e interactuar, algunos otros tambi\u00e9n nos pueden dar misiones secundarias si hablamos con ellos. Cada misi\u00f3n realizada satisfactoriamente otorga recompensas como dinero, objetos o habilidades.\n\nEl elemento principal de rol viene con un sistema de experiencia. Obtenemos XP tras realizar distintas acciones, como matar a alguien, robar cosas, encontrar \u201cobjetos interesantes\u201d, y rescatar NPC\u2019s (hay algunos atrapados que no forman parte de nuestras misiones principales) por comentar algunas, incluso uno que otro personaje no jugable se unir\u00e1 a nosotros para luchar. A estos que se nos unan podremos dotarlos de armas, curarles si le necesitan o pedirles que monten guardia en \u2018x\u2019 lugar; aquellos que nos acompa\u00f1en nos har\u00e1n compa\u00f1\u00eda hasta que mueran. Dentro del mundo de Streets of Rogue hay cosas que duelen, pero nada como ver morir a tu amigo NPC, ese pu\u00f1ado de pixeles coloridos que te acompa\u00f1\u00f3 durante una hora mientras tirabas balazos y golpes como si el ma\u00f1ana no existiera \u2013 D.E.P. Gorila.\n\nHubo un momento dado en el que decid\u00ed usar al personaje del gorila (se vuelve jugable cuando lo rescatas!) para jugar,  cada vez que intentaba hablar con un NPC no pod\u00eda y me saltaba un mensaje que dec\u00eda \u201cno s\u00e9 hablar Espa\u00f1ol\u201d, tremenda sorpresa, delirio de realidad y l\u00f3gica en el que me vi envuelto, pues no pod\u00eda hablar con los comerciantes para comprar munici\u00f3n o comida, ni conversar con mis compa\u00f1eros NPC, porque obvio, ning\u00fan gorila puede hablar -Dah, fue realmente chistoso caer en raz\u00f3n. Incluso, este peludo personaje no puede empu\u00f1ar armas porque sus dedos son muy grandes.\n\nTenemos tantas variables con las cuales divertirnos en Streets of Rogue, si queremos podemos comer una banana, y darle uso a su cascara para que alg\u00fan pobre transe\u00fante o un enemigo caigan y se debiliten, cuidado, podemos caer nosotros tambi\u00e9n.\n\nLo m\u00e1s preciado en el juego son los nuggets de pollo, alimento prohibido por el alcalde despu\u00e9s de que un dolor de estomago causado por una de estas deliciosas comidas le hiciera pasar un mal rato. As\u00ed que si encontramos nuggets, tendremos literalmente: oro. Los rasgos y habilidades especiales se desbloquean con los nunca bien ponderados nuggets. Dependiendo del personaje que escogemos, podemos llevar mas o menos inventario, usar o no armas, etc.\n\nLa rejugabilidad del juego es alta, esto en parte debido a que cada escenario es generado proceduralmente, teniendo niveles diferentes en cada nueva partida. Por otro lado, parece que las misiones principales en cada nivel no var\u00edan mucho, lo que hay mucho son posibilidades de realizar las mismas de la forma en que queramos. Lo probamos con con teclado y rat\u00f3n, pero tambi\u00e9n se puede jugar con mando.\n\nEl juego tiene de todo, en algunos niveles hay ciertas mec\u00e1nicas que cambian el juego, de ejemplo, existe la de radiaci\u00f3n, dicha inclemencia en el ambiente env\u00eda radiaci\u00f3n a lo largo del mapa que nos hiere, y s\u00f3lo podemos evitarla entrando en edificios, recordando que algunos edificios no podemos entrar porque son de criminales recelosos con sus propiedades, caus\u00e1ndonos problemas si entramos en el edificio con due\u00f1os equivocados. Esto hace del juego un corre por tu vida super divertido e hilarante si llegas a entrar a alguna casa \u201cprohibida\u201d. En Streets of Rogue, como en cada juego de su genero, una vez morimos, empezamos de cero.\n\nHaciendo un recuento a modo de conclusi\u00f3n, la diversi\u00f3n en Streets of Rogue est\u00e1 asegurada, un juego independiente creado por una sola persona (Matt Dabrowski), al cual se le ve un buen futuro, siempre y cuando Matt haga las cosas bien y haga crecer su juego. Si te gustan los juegos como Hotline Miami o el mismo GTA, pues entonces Streets of Rogue tambi\u00e9n te puede gustar.

Meh.\n\nLet's start with the trailer. I hate it. The premise that this is not even \"a\", but \"the world's only\" co-op shooter action roguelike stealth brawler rpg. Brawler, just because you use melee weapons? Shooter, just because you use guns? Action, does that not simply mean \"non-puzzler\"?\n\nThe Steam store description isn't much better. The \"This new game I [b]is inspired by[/b] <insert classics everyone will know>\", which feels like a scam every time I read it. Most of the time games that say that don't deliver.\n\nAnd indeed, I never felt it was worth comparing to those games. When Single Playered, the game is mediocre at best. There are many different playstyles, but the character+whichever valuable drops you get+the semirandom levelups dictate which playstyle to use.\n\nIt shines in MultiPlayer, even though I merely glimpsed at the possibilities there, and this is also what sets it apart from the referenced games. Just like e.g. Broforce, the game gets stale very quickly when alone, but dicking about with your friends makes anything more fun.\n\nTL;DR: Get it only if you reliably have a group of friends to play with. Local is even better. Even then this is steep, get Hammerwatch instead, that has a 25% off four-pack version.

I didn't understand what it was at all before buying, but it's definitely up my alley.\n\nBasically, you're thrown into a level with several missions (rescue this person, kill this person, retrieve this item), and they can be completed however you see fit. Literally any way you want to. If you want to be a soldier, you can just shoot everyone on the level. If you want to be a ninja, you can sneak past people and backstab targets. My favorite is the shapeshifter who can change to be anyone they see.\n\nEach level is filled with different NPCs of different roles, and the AI is fairly sophisticated (at least, it's better than I expected). If you are a gangster, watch out for rival gang members. You can speak to friendly gang members and recruit them. If you're a thief, shopkeepers will be hostile to you. If you're a crazy naked guy, literally everyone hates you. For good reason.\n\nAll this means you have to navigate the level, and constantly assess your environment to see how you want to achieve whatever it is you want to achieve. There are tons of items to help you do this (from EMP grenades to teleporters to a simple crowbar), acquired either through theft, murder, barter, or mission completion. \n\nThe game also has a lot of humor and doesn't take itself too seriously.\n\nDefinitely a lot of fun, and I'll keep this in my Steam favorites for play every once in a while.\n\nNOTE: This game is not completed. There are only 2 zones to go through (I believe there's supposed to be 3 for the base story). From what I can tell, the developer is pretty solid, but this Is an early access review after all. I'd recommend you buy it on sale if you're a penny pincher, as it's not something that you can play all day every day.

But this game was just immediately and purely fun to me.\n\nBased on that and what I've seen from the developer, I threw caution to the wind with it being Early Access and said:  \"I want to support this guy, this game has tons of potential,\"  so I bought it. \n\nFrom my experience, the missions are limited and repetitive, and there aren't many stages in the game currently. But this is an Early Access title, and you can see the developer is trying very hard and is very active with his player base already. \n\nI also applaud him for shifting his focus away from adding things to the game temporarily and instead toward fixing the issues such as multiplayer, and various other bugs. Even if he has all that fixed by the time you read this, it's a solid vote of confidence in his favor that he knows/knew what he is/was doing.\n\nDo I recommend this game? Yes, because to spite being in what feels like the early stages of developement as of my writing this, the game plays very quickly and smoothly. It's fun to run around blowing people, and things up, shooting them .. or beating them down .. or breaking and entering .. -- I have found that on average, unlike many games that limit your options to tackle an objective .. this game has supported my every approach to a problem. If I have wanted to try something, I have almost always found my approach to be doable and effective.\n\nI also recommend it because this guy really, honestly, seems to be working hard to both make a great game and earn the respect of his playerbase, through positive and affirmative action. The game has tons of potential and all he has to do is keep some of his promises in the not too distant future of more levels, more weapons, and more mayhem.\n\nThe point is, even if there isn't alot here to do right now. What is there is fast, fun and polished, with a strong and positive developer behind it. If you have the money to burn and the trailer makes the game look fun, that's because for me, atleast, it is fun. \n\nI don't regret my decision at all and I don't think you will either, if the trailer caught your attention.\n\nI will try and remember to drop by and update this at the end of this year, or around there, to see how far he makes it but right now, the ship floats wonderfully and is chartered in the right direction, so I'm on board to see where the ride takes me.\n\n**Update: 1**\nHe's been steadily adding to the game within the time frames he's been saying he would. Since writing this, he has made many improvements to the game and has added the new levels he promised he would and to the best of my knowledge, he has corrected the multiplayer issues that were brought to his attention, to the best of his ability.\n\n**Update: 2**\nI've thought about fully updating my review but I've chosen instead to leave it as is to reflect my initial feelings on this amazing game.\n\nHe has added several new playable characters, added to the amount of tactical options and mayhem you can create to accomplish objectives, and fixed tons of bugs/balancing issues/etc. He's even reverted a few changes based on the community feedback posted on his news updates. \n\nHe's also commited to a bi-weekly update schedule, is sticking to it and seems to now also be looking at more ways to engage his playerbase and get their feedback as he continues to work on the game.\n\n**Update: 3**\nI'll leave my updating this review by saying:  He's still doing a fantastic job.

It is, however, fully playable - and fun.\n\nSUMMARY: A comedic roguelike/lite mission-based game where the focus is solving the missions your way, from killing everyone to hacking computers.  Currently Early Access, it's a great deal of fun, with emergent gameplay, many solutions, and unlockables.  This is to stealth/action/puzzle adventures what Dungeonmans was to fantasy adventures.\n\nIn Streets of Rogue you're part of the Resistance, fighting against the evil Mayor who took over the many-layered city (think of it as a kind of archology).  You pick a character, sally forth into various random levels, and complete missions from freeing gorillas to stealing computer chips to generally killing people.  The difference is you solve problems your way.\n\nStreets of Rogue provides you with various characters, situations, and equipment options to help you complete your missions outside of killing people (not that it's not viable).  Depending on your character, the random level you're on, and the equipment you've collected you may:\n* Poison scientists by shoving cigarettes into an air filter so you can sneak into their lab.\n* Hack a security gun to blast guards.\n* Bribe someone to give you a special device.\n* Hire people to help you out.\n* Take a lot of drugs and go on a rampage.\n* Shoot people with a shrink ray.\n* Sneak through a dangerous lab.\n\nStreets of Rogue's emergent gameplay comes from combinations of many elements, from layouts to equipment to inhabitants, and always feels fresh.  There's rarely one way to solve a problem (though if there is it's probably violence), and you can find some truly imaginative solutions - like starting a mini-riot with a holographic bigfoot.\n\nYou also get a variety of characters to play, and unlock more as you proceed.  Be a fast-learning Slum Dweller, a smart but lanky hacker, a high-tech scientist, a gorilla, a vampire . . . each with their own advantages and disadvantages.\n\nOf course you'll die, but you'll hopefully score the currency of the future - Chicken Nuggets - to unlock abilities and equipment for your next character.\n\nOn top of this is the game's humor, which is just plain silly and funny and self-mocking.  This is a game that feels like you and your friends were joshing around about games.\n\nThe result is simple - the game is incredibly fun.  It's a good game made in the spirit of people that love games.\n\nAs noted this is Early Access.  It is not finished, so you're signing on for a fun but incomplete game.  The author is open to feedback and is quite nice, so if you sign up expect to both have fun but actually have a chance to help out.\n\n\nSo who's this for:\n* First someone willing to support Early Access.  Kind of a given.\n* If you like Roguelikes with variations on the classic dungeon theme, this is for you.\n* If you like emergent gameplay with action/puzzles, alsoa  great choice.\n* If this review sounded like it's about a game you want - the game has a certain \"something\" to it.\n\nI think this is up there with Dungeonmans on the comedic-take-on-a-genre-thats-fun.  A great game.", "timestamp_created": 1489768796, "timestamp_updated": 1489768796, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30571713": {"recommendationid": "30571713", "author": {"steamid": "76561198158313111", "num_games_owned": 28, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1478, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 224, "last_played": 1514318250}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0412\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0435\u0444\u0443\u043b", "timestamp_created": 1489767920, "timestamp_updated": 1489767920, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30571690": {"recommendationid": "30571690", "author": {"steamid": "76561198189803655", "num_games_owned": 164, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 12, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489268527}, "language": "turkish", "review": "\u0130Y\u0130 OYUN B\u0130 BAKIN DER\u0130M\n", "timestamp_created": 1489767843, "timestamp_updated": 1489767843, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.461682", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30571448": {"recommendationid": "30571448", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076701692", "num_games_owned": 51, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 138, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489323265}, "language": "german", "review": "Der Einzelspielermodus ist schon mal super.

Everything from the graphics, gameplay, challenge, unlocks and music is superb. This game was a huge blast to play and even more so with a friend. So what is this game? Streets of Rogue sets you up to kill the mayor, and you must make your way through procedurally generated levels split into different unique stages. And of course, since it's a roguelite, there's permadeath. But don't worry, every subsequent run is more fun than the last as you unlock new items, characters and entirely new gamemodes!\n\n[h1][b] Components[/b] [/h1]\n\n[b]Visuals[/b] - The visuals of Streets of Rogue are charming and beautiful. The menus and UI are sleek, and are especially polished considering this game's still in Early Access. The art of this game is eye-candy. Everything from the cyberpunk-esque lighting to the character design is well refined. The different stages all look visually unique which sets them apart well. I'm personally quite a fan of this kind of pixel visual style so I loved the graphics. \n\n[b]Audio[/b] - Streets of Rogue offers a unique song for every level in the game. This helps levels become familiar despite their random generation. The soundtrack is absolutely phenomenal and I enjoyed listening to the OST outside of the game. It's a really unique, retro-styled yet modern sounding electronic kind of music. The sound effects are pretty cool too. They give great feedback to your actions and are quite comical. Overall, Streets of Rogue delivers an impressive audio experience.\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b] - Streets of Rogue is a rogue-lite, and one unlike any other you've played. It has a unique modern style setting with procedurally generated streets. There's 3 unique stages, each with 3 levels. The stages ascend from the Slums, where all the peasants abide, to Industrial, with wealthier and more standard class citizens. More stages are planned. The actual gameplay is hugely addicting, highly polished and very rewarding. Each level requires completion of several missions, and maybe some optional missions, and how you go about completing them is entirely up to you. Generally the character you choose dictates your style of playthrough, but they're still fairly flexible. For example: the cop is strong and proficient gun-wielding character, however I love to use this character for stealth, as it possesses a unique non-lethal takedown ability. There's a plethora of characters to unlock and they're all so different and fun in their own way. Despite some negative connotations with procedural generation, each level does feel very unique and fun especially with the random missions. This game also allows you to unlock more items using a valuable currency earned from playing. This helps keep the game fresh as you find even more things to do. In its current state, Streets of Rogue has extremely fleshed out gameplay which offers huge replayability that never feels repetitive.\n\n[b]Story[/b] - After a humorous tutorial, you join the resistance and are tasked with eliminating the mayor. First you have to make your way through all the levels. The story  sets up the game nicely but currently it's fairly underwhelming. \n\n[b]Functionality[/b] - There's almost nothing I can fault the functionality of this game for. Streets of Rogue is nicely optimised and is able to run smoothly and consistently. There is very minimal bugs, and I myself encountered none. One small annoying however, picking up ammo for a gun removes it from your quick-selection bar. The multiplayer of this game is awesome and syncs pretty well despite some latency. Overall, Streets of Rogue runs impressively well even in is Early Access state. \n\n[h1][b] Pros[/b] [/h1]\n[list]\n[*] Beautiful visuals\n[*] Awesome soundtrack\n[*] Many unlockable items and abilities\n[*] Hugely replayable\n[/list]\n[h1][b] Cons[/b] [/h1]\n[list]\n[*] Only 3 stages so far\n[*] No more story after the first tutorial\n[*] Fairly easy: all characters and achievements can be unlocked in just a few hours\n[/list]\n[h1] [b]Conclusion[/b] [/h1]\n\nIf you're looking for a fun top down game that you can play with your friends, then you should definitely give this game a go. It is very enjoyable and easy to get into that even people who don't like this genre can still enjoy the game.\nI give this game a 8/10 - a massively fun roguelite with dozens of characters and unique ways to play.", "timestamp_created": 1489743303, "timestamp_updated": 1502701886, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.478793", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30565527": {"recommendationid": "30565527", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022158033", "num_games_owned": 84, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 369, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490710488}, "language": "english", "review": "I honestly haven't laughed so hard in a game in a long time.

Yes, you could just blast your way into the compound, but where's the fun in that?

Note that I reccomend this game as promising, if the developer continues to add content, this game is gonna be great as the groundwork is already solid.\n\nThe game is a top down, 2d, move with WASD/aim with the mouse shooter. Very similar to Enter the Gungeon but rather than a level that has to be completed one room at a time, you are presented with a 'level' of the 'city'. There are randomly generated NPCs and buildings. Each level you are given a handful of missions before you can move to the elevator and proceed to the next level. The focus being on the Rogue like elements, survival is the number one priority. You don't need to succeed at the missions in order to unlock the elevator to the next level, you just have to complete them. If you succeed, you get money/equipment/food. \n\nYou have an inventory and gain xp and unlock passive traits. There are lots of different classes, all with unique passives and special abilities. For example, you can play as a Gorilla! You get extra health and a super cool punch ability! But you're a Gorilla so you can't speak, so you can't interact with NPCs in the city and they usually attack you on site if you walk into their buildings. The differences between the classes are fun and meaningful. For every bonus a class has, that class also has a negative passive, this makes the unlockable classes fun and engageging rather than just 'better'. \n\nThe game encourages experimentation and usually presents several paths to a goal. Hack a buildings security system and turn the turrets on the guards? Sure! Put a bunch of unknown drugs in the ventalation system so everybody inside will OD and you can collect the loot? Oh wait that unknown drug made them invulnurable for 15 seconds? RUN!\n\nGame's buggy right now and realistically only has like 2-3 hours of content at this point, but I really like what I see and can't wait for more content to be added to this game.

Its just one of those games you have to play and cant really judge on the screenshots.\n\n[h1]Pros:[/h1]\n\n+ cool soundtrack\n+ good controls\n+ a lot of unlockable characters that change the whole game in how you approach certain goals\n+ randomly generated levels that are interesting\n+ randomly generated goals\n+ so many items and weapons\n+ it has rpg elements, where you level up your character and choose power ups\n+ you can unlock more and more power ups that will than come up randomly ingame\n+ open world\n+ not every character is an enemy its more of a city/town you roam around\n+ hire random npcs to protect you and join your party\n+ the characters make this game, a gorilla for example cant talk to people or a thief isnt welcomed in shops, making you change up your playstyle each time you play\n+ mutators to change up the gameplay\n+ local coop multiplayer! you can play in splitscreen, single screen or a mix of both, absolutely awesome\n+ online multiplayer! you can have private locked matches or play with randoms\n+ items and gadgets are very well thought out and useful in various situations\n+ when you clear all the goals you can stay in the level and do additional missions or loot peoples houses\n+ npcs also have logic to them, like gang members will automatically attack other rival gang members\n+ customize each characters look to your liking\n+ designing your own character with unique traits is going to be a thing (not included yet)\n+ the levels are designed to represent bioms in a tower, slums, industrial and so on up to the richest folk\n+ random hazards can happen (curses) for one floor, like having to hide indoors every 15 seconds to not get nuked :D\n+ the difficulty is spot on, I loved the difficulty and failure is almost always your own fault\n+ the graphics are minimalistic, but you can always determin what is what\n+ a map and teleportation system to a point on the map to not waste your time with walking (super cool idea) teleportation is of course prohibited once you are in danger, have to escort someone or stuff like that\n\n\n[h1]Cons:[/h1]\n\n- playing online with randoms is caotic and most players will just do their own thing rather than cooperating, but there is an official discord channel to counter that\n\n- some characters are extremly easy to play compared to others, I hope there will be rewards for completing the game with a more difficult character\n\n\nAmazing game, absolutely amazing.

Si vous avez la flemme de tout lire, je vais faire une CONCLUSION plus courte, tout en restant assez complet :\n\n-Tuto rapide et efficace. On apprend les bases, sans pour autant savoir ce que font tout les objets.\n\n-niveaux g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9s al\u00e9atoirement, sans que cela soit pour autant impossible par moment. Il existe toujours au moins 1 moyen de r\u00e9aliser les objectifs, si ce n'est plusieurs... On peut m\u00eame s'amuser \u00e0 tout casser, et r\u00e9ussir ! Seul hic : pour le moment il n'y a que 2 niveaux, donc 6 \"stages\" \npar contre il manque une possibilit\u00e9 de save une partie genre entre chaque stage.\n\n-Immersion assez moyenne, histoire basique des gentils qui veulent d\u00e9faire les m\u00e9chants, mais la fa\u00e7on reste dr\u00f4le, avec des missions redondantes ( peu d'objectifs diff\u00e9rents ) \u00e0 la GTA des premiers opus, des dialogues d\u00e9cal\u00e9s, sans pour autant \u00eatre hilarant. Mais bon, on est pas l\u00e0 pour \u00e7a... Pour le moment on va dire que \u00e7a passe... Pour le moment...\n\n-Nombre de personnages d\u00e9j\u00e0 tr\u00e8s \u00e9lev\u00e9. Les capacit\u00e9s ( traits dans le jeu ) sont moindres, en revanche chaque perso \u00e0 des capacit\u00e9s uniques, ce qui compense.\n\n-IA assez incroyable pour un jeu du genre ! Les PNJ r\u00e9agissent \u00e0 la moindre de vos actions, et m\u00eame pafois entre eux \u00e7a castagne. Ne vous mettez pas au milieu car vous deviendrez une cible apr\u00e8s \u00e7a !\n\n-Diversit\u00e9 des objets assez grandes pour une alpha, ce qui permet de bien se familiariser avec les bases. En esp\u00e9rant que ce nombre augmente avec la progression du d\u00e9v. du jeu.\n\n-Graphisme pixel qui plairont \u00e0 tout les joueurs fans du genre. \u00e7a renverse pas un mammouth, mais c'est color\u00e9 et dynamique, donc c'est d\u00e9j\u00e0 tr\u00e8s bien.\n\n-Bande son tr\u00e8s sympa, electro r\u00e9tro dance ( si ce mix de genres existe )\n\n-Jouabilit\u00e9 au top avec clavier + souris. Voir si avec une manette c'est sympa aussi, je n'ai pas essay\u00e9 ( \u00e0 partir du moment ou on peut cibler, je pr\u00e9f\u00e8re la souris ) \n\n-Multi : Je n'ai pas encore test\u00e9 le multiplayer \u00e0 ce stade. Mais il semble faire l'objet de beaucoup de travail \u00e0 chaque M\u00e0J, donc je pense qu'il va \u00eatre bon quand le jeu sera bien avanc\u00e9.\n\n-CONCLUSION : physiquement beau et bon, contenu d\u00e9j\u00e0 tr\u00e8s vari\u00e9, avec plein de persos, de traits, d'objets et de mods, vous donneront envie de refaire les stages diff\u00e9remment plusieurs fois. Les soucis que je trouve \u00e9tant l'histoire trop clich\u00e9e, l'impossibilit\u00e9 de save, qui rebutera les joueurs avec des dispos limit\u00e9s, et le peu de stages, qui finiront par lasser les joueurs qui auront \"farm\u00e9\" le jeu.

My overall impression though is that it's a pretty solid game, especially for an \"alpha\" build.\n\nThe way the game is presented (the intro video with the genre soup) and trying to shove in talking points like \"Nuclear throne (did it change from Isaac?) and Deus Ex with GTA\" was pretty offputting, but it was free so I tried it out. Going off of that, the tutorial is also pretty bad. Mechanically it's a fine way to learn the mechanics but the 'narrative' of it was also kind of off.\n\nDespite early misgivings I think the game's actually very good. There's \"only\" 2 zones currently but as I messed around with a handful of characters for a while, it took me till nearly the end of my play time to realize that (and it was only because I was specifically trying to get to the end). That play time was 6.3 hours, and in that I played through like 5-6 of the characters and got all the current achievements. The 6 that I played (Thief, Assassin, Hacker, Doctor, Jock, Police, and the Scientist to unlock the ghost) seemed pretty fun, though as I saw someone else comment, a lot of the classes are defined mainly by items they have, and those run out relatively quickly. \n\nThief can still pickpocket but will run out of his other tools, and while that actually won't happen much in the game because of the 2 zones, it'll most likely happen with other classes and more frequently later on. Classes whose quirk is a permanent thing, like the hacker, assassin, and jock feel much better because you don't have to be very stingey with it. I'm not entirely sure how you'd balance around it, (and it might be because of the classes I ended up playing but I didn't actually run into this almost at all) but that seems to be the main balance issue. Assassin is also super overpowered (though fun, through that).\n\nThe only other issue I can think of is the relative lack of variety in mission types. There's a small handful, and while they don't seem that bad because of the random generation, I'm sure they'd get very tiring later on. I'm assuming that later on in the development more might be added, as this is an alpha.\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1489475725, "timestamp_updated": 1489475725, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488372", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30503244": {"recommendationid": "30503244", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987292682", "num_games_owned": 334, "num_reviews": 127, "playtime_forever": 339, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512355475}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]Let's kill the major[/h1]\n\nNice rougle-lite.

The gameplay is fantastic, but the content is still a work in progress. Which is normal for games still in early access. Also can't wait to see how the story gets played out by the time we get to face the one and only major. I want to kill that son of a bitch for letting me have a good time killing other people.. for a ******** beer.\n\nOverall, I give it a 9/10. Will raise or lower it if the developer plays his cards right or not. ;)\n\n\nStreets Of Rogue. A game that combines many mechanics into one, unique style of gameplay. I've tried it when it was launched and on it's free weekend, and 2 hours into the game convinced me to fork up that 13$ that it was at the time, as I believed its content and enjoyment will go up in price as it's development gets further.\n\nFor those who haven't read the description yet, it's a game where you can come up an seeming endless amount of tactics to try and accomplish missions throughout the small town area. (It's actually a huge city, cut off into 3 regions for each sector. There's currently 2 sectors, but as development continues, more sectors will be available to play, making longer runs.)\n\nThis game actually has a story as well. In a nutshell, it's simply about a major whos gone curropted with power and greed, and a faction who calls themselves; \"The Resistance\" has been formed to kill the major and turn the city back to normal. You, the player, has recently joined the resistance was put up with some training. Once your training was complete, you went out into the city doing whatever it takes to complete the tasks given to you. Trading a rare currency called Chicken Nuggets, that lets you be able to gain powerful traits as you level up (which resets every time you die on a character) or unlock new types of rewards to find new ways of completing missions. You could also use a small amount of those nuggets to grab a useful item that might come in handy when you go out next time with your character.\n\nThe gameplay itself lets you be able to do an seemingly endless amount of tactics/strategies to complete your missions.\nOh? Need to take out the shopkeeper in that building? Distract it by hacking into its computer, walking out of the building with suspicion, then BOOM! a landmine to the foot. Or, you could silently kill him as an assassin. Hmm.. How about shrinking the fellow and crushing him good under your shoes. That seems satisfying.. I could rant on and on about the strategies you could do to finish the mission, but that would take quite alot of your time.\n\nThere's also Classes. Characters that have their own personality, stats, starting items, and even special abilities. You can be able to unlock more classes by doing certain things on your mission. Like taking out many members of a single gang, getting drunk, or even breaking tombstones.\n\nThere's also Multiplayer for the game as well, both Local and Global. Have more chaotic fun with your friends. However, I did encounter a few bugs and only one of them broke the game. Didn't have as much problems in singlelayer.\n\nThe developer also has plans to release lots of more content as well in the distant future, some of which I have probably mentioned earlier and more of these below:\n-Being able to create your own character.\n-SEED. Have no idea what it does to be honest.\n-More items, buildings, and even sectors.\n-Obviously bug fixes.\n-Probably more mutations? (Normal runs with a twist in them)\n\nNow for the Pros and Cons of the game:\n\nPros:\n-Amazing gameplay. I already mentioned this several times.\n-Gives you the ability to be creative in handling missions.\n-Has good stability. Haven't gotten a crash yet for me. People who have slower pcs might run into issues.\n-Has decent content that lets you be able to deal with certain situations in many ways.\n\nCons:\n-Lack of Content. It's kind-of both a pro and a con because while it does have some content that can keep you busy for a while, it doesn't seem endless after many hours of playtime.\n-Bug issues. It's normal in alpha, and I tend to see them more in multiplayer.\n-AI can be idiotic/stupidly smart. This one time, I try to attack a theif in self-defense while a cop is cruising by and it suddenly starts attacking me because I was \"breaking the law\". Kind-of resembles real life tbh. Not something major, but forces you to make certain decisions you otherwise wouldn't. Probably just my opinion however.\n\nOverall: The game has great gameplay, loads of hours of replayability, started out a decent plot for the game, and is constantly bringing in more content with each month or so. (Whether that be bug fixes or additional content). Though be open-minded about the seemingly lack of content it has at the moment and the multiplayer bugs it has. (they're also in singleplayer but are minor things that don't impact much)\nThis is a game that you can currently buy for at a small price right now. And it's price will casually rise as it soon gets closer and closer to full release. You'll be paying for the amount of quality it has to offer, and you will be getting more of it in enjoyability profit as the game continues to expand and add more content.\nIt's also a good game to play if your in a bad mood and just want to do things your way.

They were all there. The only two things I did'nt really like about the game or I think the developers should add were the mission styles because there was only three or four the entire game and when you play the game and then lose when your on like 3-3 (which I think means stage 3 level 3 but dont quote me on that) and die because you accidently shoot a rocket right by you and all your progress is lost AND on top of that it took you like an hour to get to there I think there should be some way to save your game or not start off at the beggining when you die. which happened to me...

Besides the brilliant move by the just as brilliant tinyBuild, this game reminds me a ton like Binding of Isaac, with the addition of GTA or something like that. A mini RPG but if you dont dig RPG games this is still for you, probably just as much as those who love 'em.\n\n2-3 Objectives per floor, 3 of every floor before a new \"Level\" and theres 5 level. Do simple math for 15 floors. Third floor on every \"level\" includes a difficult twist. This game isnt finished as of I'm writing it, but its still great. Up to 4 players per (computer?) or Local/Online playing also being up to 4 players. Several characters already implemented and more to come, I'd assume the same with levels but I'm not sure.\n\nOne thing I enjoy is that this game isn't like your average game where your enemy will leap at you without reason. They need a reason. Whether you enter an area you're not allowed to be in, you didnt leave an area when the owner said you needed to, or you decided you wanted to pick the fight and hit them. Keep in mind if you hit an enemy the friends of your enemy will also attack you (Ex. Hit a cop -> All nearby cops attack OR Hit a goon at peaceful place -> All possible hostiles begin to attack). Another nice touch is that they run away at low health, as tedious as it may be it's still cool.\n\nSeveral interactions, even more items. This game comes with a tutorial so you won't get lost around the place and after the tutorial everything new is easy to understand. \n\nMy one complaint is to adjust the \"Disasters\" which, like mentioned before, is an event on the third floor of each \"level\" and carries a difficult challenge thatll haunt you throughout the floor. I dislike the intensity of these disasters because they go as followed;\n\nDisaster 1: A robot practically indestructible and can wipe a third of the possible chosen characters health (at least half of available characters come with 80 to 100HP and the robot does 30HP per shot) the robot fires an RPG (with infinite ammo?) and can also be used to your advantage, if you can take a hit or two just for the upper hand on a different problem. If you're thinking \"Well its an RPG shot, cant it kill itself?\" I did mention it being indestructible, which is an exaggeration. It has tons of HP (perhaps 1000HP to the average 100HP of your character) and 30 is nothing to its HP (34 shots will do 1020 damage, the least required) with that damage, unlike your 5 shots at most to die.\n\nDisaster 2: Raining Bombs. God is this tedious. Not even that lethal, it comes to your advantage greatly cause you get the shadow of a bomb.

I don't find it funny. Not my cup of tea. Its generic 'humor' where some people laugh at something because its SUPPOSED to be funny, as opposed to actually being funny. The good news is this is only a problem in offline mode. And i only did the tutorial and went to the home base in offline mode so there may not actually be too much of that we have to worry about.\n\nBut i LOVE the gameplay. The gameplay is EXCELLENT. And with more levels added where it gets harder and harder its only going to get even better. Its chaotic. No matter what it will be chaotic at some point during your play. And i had the privilege of playing both in a passworded room with just me and my bro, and i also made Open Game rooms where anyone could join.  It was a good time in both cases. I very much enjoyed myself. I guess in online mode you only really have to worry if your team members are incredibly selfish. But if you want to do special quests like unlocking characters and such, or trying to beat the whole thing without alarming anyone, or just beating all floors, you might want to play with people you know will try their best to accomplish this, because its so easy to mess up the level for everyone on your team. Which right now, i didnt run into anyone who intentionally tried to, but eventually there will be.\n\nI also suggest that you all open yourselves up to playing with people you dont know, sometimes. I saw only 1 or 2 open rooms at any given time. ALL the rest were passworded. Come on people. I was one of the few who hosted open rooms. And when i joined one other players room i got kicked because the game didnt move to the next level because a new player had joined the room but not the game. And they blamed me for it. Which was dumb, and a sh*t move. Dont be a**holes. This game is too cool for that. WHich brings us to the next point: in online play, currently, if you finish the level and go into the elevator, but someone joins the room at that time, the game will not progress until the new player joins the GAME. They have to be loaded into the floor and possibly even run to the elevator youre all waiting in. If you know this, it will save you all alot of anger. Try opening your minds and not assuming so much. It does the world good.\n\nThe music is excellent. So simple, but so lovely, and catchy as all hell. Very reminiscent of the Spelunky soundtrack.\n\nThe only issue preventing me from getting it right now is that I think 15 dollars is a lot for a game of this type in Early Access, where its not a full game yet and there are TONS of frustrating bugs. There really are limitations that you can feel within the game because you know how big the game is supposed to be. And thats fine, but not for 15 dollars a game. I really want to buy this for 3 people and that would be ALOT of money for such a small early access bugged game. I will probably wait until it goes on sale for a decent price.\n\nBugs:\nI had a lot. \n* I couldnt kill myself using a banana peel. So sorry to say we tried several times. My brother got it but i couldnt. It kept saying i killed myself with fist. Which is impossible. (It would be great if it wasnt impossible though) \n* At the end i hosted an open game and people were joining but once i finished a level they couldnt seem to join me in the next level. And it never said they left. I think my whole hosted game was bugged at that point.\n* We couldnt see door detonators when placed by anyone, or mines when placed by another player.\n* in online play, currently, if you finish the level and go into the elevator, but someone joins the room at that time, the game will not progress until the new player joins the GAME. They have to be loaded into the floor and possibly even run to the elevator youre all waiting in.\n\nI cant remember them all but there were alot.\nSo if youre playing at this right now during early access just expect it to be very buggy. Im sure the developer will fix all of that eventually but right now it is an issue. Be sure to report everything you come across in the feedback to help him/them to fix all of the issues. Theres a feedback option in the main menu of the game. You can do it at any time, including while in the middle of an online game. Lol but even that is wonky. \n\nRequests:\n* PLease add a witch? Think of all the fun things you could do with a witch. And give her a witchs hat? : D ?\n* Please make it more affordable considering its still in early access and short and bugged to hell.\n* Make it possible to kick players without having to type their names in. Anyone with special characters cant be kicked because you have to type names in, and you cant type wierd names. Which obviously makes it easy to get around being kicked.\n* Please allow us to move around when our inventory is open. This game is way too crazy to stand still most of the time. Like, move around with WASD/D Pad, while going through inventory with the mouse/Analog.\n* PLease allow us to choose how much money to drop. Or to just give directly to another player because in order for me and my team to buy things we sometimes had to drop money for each other, but it would be best if we didnt have to submit ALL our money to them, in case they dont give it back after they buy what they want, or if things are too chaotic and they dont have time to give it back.\n\nI know i had more things i wanted to ask for in this game so i will edit this when i remember because i can no longer ask in feedback since the free weekend is over.\n\n\nOverall, i love the game. And you need to know its 100 times more fun than it looks like in the video. \n\nPS I warned my bother that if he told jokes the people didnt like they would attack him.

The simple synopsis is that you control one dude, get objectives and have to complete them in a manner you decide yourself. \n\nPick from a selection of various classes like doctors, hackers, thiefs, assassin's (and many more ) each with individual traits, strengths and weaknesses, and roam about randomly generated cities. You can play alone or with up to three other players in co-op (locally or online) and truth be told this is the way to play this. Along the way you find various weapons, useables, health items and much more for benefit or demise. Some of them are truly bizarre. \n\nWhile the game name inspires you to use \"stealth\", and you surely can enjoy the game that way, the true marvel of Streets of Rogue is when everything goes to hell. There is so much great content coming from the dynamic systems at work here that it must be experienced to be properly appreciated. Random NPCs suddenly beating each others, axe-happy slavers, Gorillas with rocket launchers, hobos throwing grenades, a myriad of followers and freaking nuclear bombs dropping from the sky! And that's only the beginning. Oh, and did I mention you can clone yourself? Stupidiously awesome.\n\nIn short; Haven't had this much fun in a long time, and I've only seen a small portion of what's on offer.

It's a great addition to the rogue-like category, with solid gameplay that's just diverse enough to be interesting. I can't speak to the co-op elements, but as a solo game it has a lot to offer, particularly for an early access title. Overall, it's a game I highly recommend. \n\nMy only significant criticism is that there are only a handful of mission types at present. You'll be rescuing a lot of gorillas, neutralizing random dudes, opening safes, freeing slaves, and escorting people to the stage entrance. I'm sure there will be more missions types and variety to come, and for a game that's still in alpha there's a lot to like, but at the moment the stages very much feel like something generated by an algorithm. \n\nPros:\n+Great soundtrack\n+Fun selection of playable characters\n+Well-executed retro art\n+Never the same mission twice\n+Tons of opportunity for different play styles\n+Dev has plans to add Workshop and mods\n\nCons:\n-Can be repetitive\n-Some missions are virtually impossible to complete non-violently\n-Not as much emergent gameplay as you might expect", "timestamp_created": 1489419835, "timestamp_updated": 1489419835, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30492112": {"recommendationid": "30492112", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118921998", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1025, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489418505}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Este jogo \u00e9 excelente e tem um \u00f3timo potencial. \u00c9 bom que da para jogar s\u00f3, online e em rede.

Want to go guns blazing ? Want to posses people ? Want to punch your way through ? Want others to do your dirty work ? Well , you can do all of them and many more.

Unfortunately for me, I'm the thief, rendering my presence in any sort of public building met with hostility. There are also three goons armed with various melee weapons capable of bringing my demise. I have an RPG, luckily found through a vendor, as well as a syringe that has an unknown effect. My final weapon of choice will be a banana that I plan on using either for health or for some sort of advantage to be gained in a 1v1 scenario. So, I head over to the side of the hospital to the air ventilator and drop in my syringe. The effect turns out to be strength, but regardless the gas seeps through the vents and the 10 or so bouncers and doctors flee outside the one entrance and amass in a large pool of bodies, waiting for the gas to end. I pause for a moment and then realize I have an RPG, and seeing an opportunity too juicy to pass up, fire at the clump of people. The rocket connects and I gib 6 of them, while the rest flee inside. I scamper in and annihilate three with a police baton with relative ease, but a goon with a pistol is moving in and out of rooms, attempting to search for me. I drop my banana right outside the door of the room he's in and lo and behold, he sidesteps the banana with ease and opens fire. Having the strength bonus I gave before, his shots take me down from 40 or so health to exactly 5, just enough time for me to stab him to death. I flip the switches, congratulate myself, and then proceed to slip on my own banana peel while staring at my inventory, trip, take 5 damage, and die.\n\nMoral of the story? Buy this game. Even if you manage to kill yourself with a banana peel.", "timestamp_created": 1489406529, "timestamp_updated": 1489406529, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30487484": {"recommendationid": "30487484", "author": {"steamid": "76561198158629130", "num_games_owned": 18, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 230, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489247420}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6e38\u620f\u975e\u5e38 \u4e0d\u9519 \u5f88\u6709\u521b\u610f \uff0c\u4f46\u662f  \u5185\u5bb9 \u592a\u5c11\u5bf9\u4e0d\u8d77 \u8fd9\u4e2a\u4ef7\u683c", "timestamp_created": 1489396495, "timestamp_updated": 1489396495, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30487440": {"recommendationid": "30487440", "author": {"steamid": "76561198089020180", "num_games_owned": 93, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 99, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500222673}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6e38\u620f\u4e0d\u9519\uff0c\u5c31\u662f\u8054\u673a\u57fa\u672c\u6ca1\u529e\u6cd5\u6b63\u5e38\u8fdb\u884c\uff0c\u60f3\u548c\u57fa\u53cb\u8054\u673a\u5f88\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u80fd\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1489396257, "timestamp_updated": 1489396257, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30487080": {"recommendationid": "30487080", "author": {"steamid": "76561198370785662", "num_games_owned": 14, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 508, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489319015}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is just fun. My advice is to give it a chance as I didn't really like it during the first 15 minutes, but once I got the hang of the game and started experimenting more I couldn't put it down until I had every achievement. I'm looking forward to the full release.\n\n-Pros-\n\n-Many different items, characters, and abilities that make each run feel very different from the last.\n-I like the pixel graphics. It looks great to me.\n-Well designed menus and UI. Easy to keep track of inventory and just the right amount of inventory space in my opinion.\n-The random twist at the end of each level makes things way more interesting.\n\n-Cons-\n\n-Not enough mission variety. Hopefully that changes with the full release, but they get a bit repetitive as it is.\n-I hesitate to list this as a con, but I find the game too easy with a lot of the classes. There are some very powerful starting items and abilities that trivialize most of the content. If later levels are harder then I don't see this as an issue as those powerful items and abilities are still a lot of fun to play with.

Its misleading. I suggest calling it Syn..Grumpy Streets of Genocide...Dicate. That ones free, by the way.\nYOU'RE WELCOME!\n\nI bring this up because I was expecting a brawler type game and what I got instead is MUCH better than the games title would suggest. This game is very close to the original Syndicate on Amiga. I imagine most of you have no idea what that means but basically it was great. It was Grand Theft Auto before that game had even been invented yet AND you had a group of 4 (if you wanted) goons and unleashed mass carnage.\nThat is this game, it's huge carnage if you want or silent take downs if you prefer. Its kind of great but uh-oh I said 'kind of' instead of 'it's totally awesome!' and there is a reason for that. Not all options will be available at all times. for example  You might prefer the stealthy no kill option only to be presented with a situation that cannot be resolved outside of mass genocide. \n\nI like it, it creates a think on your feet kind of gameplay and if you use the time-limit mutator then things get really hectic as your calm and collected approach might go out the window as you need to get things done, quick!\nInfact it might sound odd but my biggest worry is that the large scope of the game will not be filled out. I enjoyed what gameplay there was but there was no denying that after I went full carnage, full stealth and finally full killing by proxy, I was \"done\".\n\nIt isn't that the game lacks content, its randomly generated so that won't be a problem but its more the ways you can approach the missions is limited. You either pickpocket the item, buy it from the person in question or you kill them and loot it from their corpse. It sounds like you have a lot of options but you typically have 3 to 4 objectives a stage so it really gets repetitive regardless of approach.\n\nSadly I don't think this can be fixed. Not with the random generation system in place. Overall the game is fun, a lot of fun. I had a blast playing it and placing cyanide down an air vent and watching the people inside the building explode into giblets is great fun but this is closer to a party game than a deep single player experience. On that note the netcode? Grade A. It is better than Street Fighter V although thats not saying much! But I could connect and play and only disconnected twice which sounds negative but it really isn't. I had way more issues with Starbound netcode!\n\nDo I recommend this game? I do! But do I recommend buying this game? At least right now? Eeeeeeh, thats not so easy to answer. What we have so far looks great, I'm really digging it but I did get bored 2 hours in and only kept playing to unlock things. That is a bad sign and that was in multiplayer as well!\nIn singleplayer I got bored even faster and started speed running stages just to make unlocking things go faster. Maybe its due to years of me playing Syndicate so I might just get Deja vu but if you never played or even heard of that game then you will probably fall in love with Streets of Rogue.\n\nThat jab about the name at the beginning wasn't unfounded by the way. This game needs to change its name because it is not a sidescrolling brawler which its name might lead some to believe. I know I certainly went in expecting a side on brawler and while I enjoyed the game regardless, people looking for a brawler are going to be unhappy and people looking for a spiritual sequel to Syndicate are certainly not going to look at the title of this game and expect it to be what they were looking for!\n\nJoin Grumpy reviews for all your gaming needs\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/grumpyreviews", "timestamp_created": 1489370322, "timestamp_updated": 1489370322, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.414594", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30483257": {"recommendationid": "30483257", "author": {"steamid": "76561198262367197", "num_games_owned": 72, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 268, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489380348}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is addicting, with randomly generated floors and ~20 classes to play as, which all have very unique playstyles.

I expect significant and rapid changes to take place given the sudden popularity and obvious developer engagement. I would wait until the developer puts a bit more down on what the vision of the end product will be.\nAfter playing through the game once on my own, and once in a 2-person coop, the game definitely has replay value. In its unfinished state I wouldn't pay $15 for it. I also do not see a plan put forth for where the game is going, so I wouldn\u2019t invest on the hope that in the future the game is worth $15. I expect to get about 20 hours of game play per $10 spent, so with this game I think it would begin to feel grindy after the 5th or 6th play through and lose its charm after the 10 hour mark.\nThe level generation is well done, but lacks the cause/effect mechanics I would expect from a Rogue style game. Case in point, there are really only three tasks: (1) Kill someone, (2) steal something, and (3) rescue someone. Of these the solution to tasks are very straight forward and free form, but lack depth and consequence. Usually a one step approach either succeeds or fails; IE: Go in kill everyone take the safe. The map layout, door mechanic, and ownership are well done to produce a living world. \nNPC\u2019s feel alive due to their interaction with the environment and reaction to different character types. The actions of your character causes reactions and \u2018problem solving\u2019 logic in the NPC\u2019s that caught me a few times thinking, \u201cHow\u2019d they catch me?!\u201d Many of the items to buy or pickup feel like they run off of a simple algorithm and are less useful than initially expected.\nThe multiple characters\u2019 with differing skills and starting items is an excellent touch. The leveling system is bare bones, with little control over how the level up progresses the character. I would expect more customization in this regard as the game is flushed out.\nNotes on Improvement to get me to buy the game:\n1)\tThe levels should get more and more difficult and essentially go on forever. Sub floors, and larger structures that require a combination of hacking, brute force and manipulation to get the job done would make multiplayer significantly better.\n2)\tThe tasks need to have more depth. An example would be;  you had to free a hacker to break into a special computer that would then open a door so you could steel an item that would be used later in the game to save a leader of the resistance force you are working with. Another example would be to free a scientist that gives you a special weapon that is needed to fight a boss.\n3)\tBosses.\n4)\tAdded character leveling depth. I would like to see maybe 20 core attributes (speed, strength, hacking skill, language, etc..) that you would get a couple points to allocate per level, plus a general point bonus based on level and type of character. If you were a soldier you may get a weapon upgrade per level, or be able to gain a skill in explosive weapons so you could use grenades more effectively.\n5)\tLarger map with larger field of view. It would seem reasonable for a game that allows warping in a mini-map that would allow scrolling out then ctrl-clicking on a location to jump. The minimap seems redundant. The map in general seems like it could be larger by maybe 2x.\n6)\tUse the idea of a greater mission to have long term tasks and short term tasks. Like bribe 20 cops and take over the district, or run a drug trafficking ring to make 1,000 gold. This sub-game then builds to a higher leveling tactic for each type of character. Like the soldier could pick up goon\u2019s by the intimidation skill and level up his rank to general which would allow him to command the cops around later in the game.", "timestamp_created": 1489365178, "timestamp_updated": 1489365178, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30482354": {"recommendationid": "30482354", "author": {"steamid": "76561198343444823", "num_games_owned": 66, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 98, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498174918}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5389\u5bb3\u4e86\uff0c\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u8da3\uff0c\u591a\u4eba\u7684\u65f6\u5019\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u6709bug\uff0c\u4e0d\u8fc7\u8fd8\u662f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7248\u561b\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u8d8a\u505a\u8d8a\u597d", "timestamp_created": 1489365039, "timestamp_updated": 1489365039, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30482344": {"recommendationid": "30482344", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067765369", "num_games_owned": 183, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1061, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512612654}, "language": "ukrainian", "review": "One word: fookingamazeballsmotherfunkersbuyitbuyitBUYIT!!!\n\nMake of that what you will.", "timestamp_created": 1489364978, "timestamp_updated": 1489364978, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30482329": {"recommendationid": "30482329", "author": {"steamid": "76561198033830477", "num_games_owned": 66, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 15, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489350875}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5143\u7d20\u592a\u8fc7\u4e8e\u4e30\u5bcc\u3002\u5b8c\u5168\u6ca1\u7cbe\u529b\u7814\u7a76\u3002\n\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u8001\u5e74\u4eba\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u5f88\u559c\u6b22\u8fd9\u4e2a\u98ce\u683c\u3002\n\u8fd8\u662f\u7ed9\u4e2a\u63a8\u8350\u5427...", "timestamp_created": 1489364894, "timestamp_updated": 1489364894, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.435906", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30482309": {"recommendationid": "30482309", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024603174", "num_games_owned": 269, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 853, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494882056}, "language": "spanish", "review": "El juego es una verdadera pasada, no tiene filtros y es muy divertido jugarlo con tus amigos.", "timestamp_created": 1489364787, "timestamp_updated": 1489364787, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30482304": {"recommendationid": "30482304", "author": {"steamid": "76561198135552114", "num_games_owned": 89, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 316, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489371583}, "language": "english", "review": "A good Rouge game lol. i would like have it lol , i have fun in the tutorial and doing shit in the levels\n\nAnd have a little good spanish traduction but meh is a early ascces if u like buy it \n\n[to me]\n\nenjoy playing stalker.", "timestamp_created": 1489364768, "timestamp_updated": 1489364768, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.468992", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30482127": {"recommendationid": "30482127", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002689753", "num_games_owned": 293, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 1049, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507656507}, "language": "english", "review": "*Poison people making them small* They get crushed from people's stepping on them.\n*Poison people making them giant* They destroy everything by walking into them.\n*Poison people with cyanide* They instantly explode.\nThis game is....

It's got an impressive breadth of content in some areas, but seriously lacks in others. Specifically, there are dozens of consumables, tools, buffs, weapons, and even character classes. There's an insane number of ways you can approach most mission objectives... provided you're actually afforded the opportunity to do so, which, this being a randomly generated roguelike-like, you often aren't.\n\nExample: You need to loot a safe or detonate a generator in the back room of a shop staffed by an armed owner and two hired goons. The back room lacks any access points besides the door from the main room. There are no computers, no vents, nothing in the area you can use to your advantage. You're playing as a thief, which ironically further limits your available options as all shop owners will accost you on sight even if you're behaving yourself. You COULD use a blink tool to phase into the back room through the outer wall, do your thing, and use another blink tool to get back out -- but now you're down TWO of those precious and often irreplaceable tools for one dumb mission. Short of that, your only real recourse is to brute force your way in through the front... through three armed guards, as a thief. Good luck with that one, champ.\n\nIt's really nice when through whatever oddball combination of RNG elements you ARE given the opportunity to MacGyver your way through an objective. Unfortunately, all too often you just don't have that sort of opportunity no matter HOW you play your cards with what you're given. Loot from containers is an absolute crapshoot (spend a hack tool and a lockpick getting at a treasure chest and it has $3 inside; examine a trash can outside and find $13 and a sandwich), and utilities cost way too much given how quickly you have to burn through them and how slowly you get money.\n\nI also can't figure out how to access online co-op for the life of me.\n\nInsofar, missions lack variety (loot safe; detonate generator; obtain an item someone's carrying; neutralize someone; rescue an NPC) but I'll give the dev benefit of the doubt here and say that'll be worked on soon enough. The free launch weekend is a nice idea, it's given me an opportunity to see what I think of the game without shelling out for and subsequently refunding it, and given the overall reception, it seems to be working out well.\n\nI'm sadly having more frustration than fun with it in its current state, but I will say that if you do like it, you should probably spring for the collector's edition.

The game provides different ways to tackle objeectives, compounds and situations with friends or by yourself. With that in mind, get ready to use the Endless mutagen after completing what little there is in the standard game at the moment.\n\nWhile I find the game to be fun for the schenanigans that occur when playing with friends and the Mario Party-esque friend loss that will occur depending on a player's choices, the game still has some work to do. So, here are my gripes and feedback for the game:\n\n1. Issues with the gamepad\n\nWhen playing the game on a gamepad, I experienced issues where action menus sometimes disappeared and the camera locked into place. This is an issue because some actions are outside of your character's inate traits and skills. For instance, the hacker has a ranged hacking move. While others do not have this special move, there are items that allow for remote hacking. This is an issue when you may only have one chance to hack a distant computer and end up losing that chance thanks to the menu disappearing. My guess is that the game has issues with understanding when the mouse is not in use.\n\n2. Bar Blocks\n\nSometimes when dealing with vendors and retailers in the game, the person you are talking to will ask you drop an item or cancel out your shop menu in other ways. I understand if a building a block away explodes and the seller wants to check it out; however, when they ask me to drop an accuracy mod again and again by canceling out the menu, it becomes annoying.\n\n3. Progression Traits\n\nPlease remember, I understand this is in early access and more should be coming down the road. That being said, some of the progression traits for each level may not benefit your character. Cherry picking a scenario and using self-reference criteria here: I did not find the early skill traits when playing as the Doctor to be useful towards my gameplay. Having extra crit hits and the ability to identify syringes does not help me when I am playing as a pacifist character that can already identify syringes. While a trait like increasing followers and the ability to not trip lasers and floor traps seems great alternatives, I hardly found any use in them when playing as this character.\n\n4. Seed Generators (Feature Creep)\n\nIt may not be out yet and may even be the greatest thing ever for the game depending on how the community uses it. That being said, this is more of a cautionary: watchout for feature creep. This isn't  a negative, just a reminder that the community is here and some want to work with the developers by helping the game become better through feedback and opportunities. Sometimes those opportunities may not be what the community really wants or needs, but what the loudest group desires.\n\nTL;DR\n\nStreets of Rogue is an engaging rougelike in early development stages. There may be issues with the game, such as minor blocks and progression issues here and there; however, the game does a great job at combining multiple elements into a fun experience for you and your friends.

Mesmo sem usar o soldado (extremamente op), ainda n\u00e3o \u00e9 muito dif\u00edcil chegar longe, mesmo na primeira run.\n-As miss\u00f5es no cooperativo n\u00e3o aumentam ou ficam mais dif\u00edceis, ent\u00e3o jogar com amigos \u00e9 para, literalmente, tornar o jogo bem mais f\u00e1cil sendo que, como falei acima, j\u00e1 \u00e9 f\u00e1cil demais.\n-Tem personagem pra cacete, mas poucos deles s\u00e3o realmente legais. N\u00e3o me refiro a \"legais\" por serem \"badasses\" ou parecido, mas sim \"legais\" de realmente \u00fateis. Muitos personagens tem desvantagens t\u00e3o absurdas que n\u00e3o existe raz\u00e3o alguma para us\u00e1-los.\n-A variedade de miss\u00f5es \u00e9 pequena e normalmente fica em: resgatar algu\u00e9m, neutralizar algu\u00e9m, recuperar algum item ou apertar bot\u00f5es.\n-O jogo conta com 2 mundos de 5 e esses 2 mundos n\u00e3o s\u00e3o t\u00e3o diferentes assim.\n\nN\u00e3o recomendo a compra no momento e \u00e9 melhor acompanhar os criadores pra saber se as atualiza\u00e7\u00f5es ser\u00e3o realmente dignas e r\u00e1pidas, mas se for bem feito, tem potencial de se tornar um dos melhores roguelikes dispon\u00edveis na steam. De qualquer forma, devo pegar no futuro, quando o jogo tiver mais conte\u00fado.", "timestamp_created": 1489347460, "timestamp_updated": 1489347460, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526440", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30477950": {"recommendationid": "30477950", "author": {"steamid": "76561198140984608", "num_games_owned": 47, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 427, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502556241}, "language": "english", "review": "1000000011/92743\n\nWould fight gorilla with level 1 slum dweller again", "timestamp_created": 1489347025, "timestamp_updated": 1489347025, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497512", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30477928": {"recommendationid": "30477928", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050618915", "num_games_owned": 343, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1769, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 93, "last_played": 1513299874}, "language": "english", "review": "So many ways to play this game even when it's not even complete yet, really hoping this game doesn't stay in EA hell because I'm really enjoying it and I very rarely write reviews so this is saying alot.", "timestamp_created": 1489346939, "timestamp_updated": 1489346939, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30477799": {"recommendationid": "30477799", "author": {"steamid": "76561198243735702", "num_games_owned": 15, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 594, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489423375}, "language": "english", "review": "Really good, some of the AI are a bit stupid but overall its a really good game! cant wait until its finished, i do think it should be cheaper though", "timestamp_created": 1489346480, "timestamp_updated": 1489346480, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30477491": {"recommendationid": "30477491", "author": {"steamid": "76561198278668290", "num_games_owned": 87, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 46, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489412282}, "language": "german", "review": "Eine Super  spiel es macht seher viel spa\u00df und mit freunden so wie so !!!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1489345580, "timestamp_updated": 1489345580, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496425", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30477437": {"recommendationid": "30477437", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037101776", "num_games_owned": 2838, "num_reviews": 196, "playtime_forever": 96, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489377114}, "language": "english", "review": "Pensive, exploitable, rogue-inspired, single-run game with enticing open floors and chaotic consequences for both action and hilarity. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HM1Isn6vw0http://store.steampowered.com/app/512900#", "timestamp_created": 1489345438, "timestamp_updated": 1489345438, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.470464", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30477287": {"recommendationid": "30477287", "author": {"steamid": "76561198211057741", "num_games_owned": 89, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 356, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496067622}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty Amazing game but it doesnt have alot of stuff in it maybe waiting for later updates to make it worth what you are paying", "timestamp_created": 1489344970, "timestamp_updated": 1489344970, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30477210": {"recommendationid": "30477210", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998212552", "num_games_owned": 521, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 1181, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489354422}, "language": "french", "review": "Un jeu tr\u00e8s fun, avis \u00e0 tous les amateurs de rogue-like, il a d\u00e9j\u00e0 plein d'objets et de personnages aux capacit\u00e9s distinctes, qui changent totalement votre exp\u00e9rience de jeu ! \n\nIl se termine assez vite pour le moment mais on y revient sans arr\u00eat pour tester une autre mani\u00e8re de jouer avec un autre personnage. \n\nUn simple exemple, je devais tuer quelqu'un en prison.

The first time or two are pretty straightforward... you're probably gonna end up duking it out a lot... but some of the other classes really open up your options!

Yeah, I know, I know!), especially when he found a growth item (forgot what they're called)... hilarious destruction!\n\nDisasters will also keep you on your toes, but can still add another level of tactics, to boot. Why steal a key and unlock a room when you can just trick the Killer Robot hunting you into blasting the outer wall open? I also had a blast when a mission asked me to get an item from a guy in a fortified building full of thugs... and I just dumped Rage Poison into the vents and let them wreck each other and, when the fight spilled into the streets, the local police.\n\nI won't be able to afford this full price, but I'll definitely be looking for it to go on sale!

da franquia Deus Ex e amante de jogos que deixam as possibilidades para concluir fases/miss\u00f5es ao gosto do player, digo que esse jogo simplesmente \u00e9 excelente nesse quesito. Um exemplo b\u00e1sico: possivelmente voc\u00ea vai ter que neutralizar um alvo espec\u00edfico constantemente. Como Hacker, voc\u00ea pode abrir as v\u00e1lvulas de g\u00e1s venenoso da sala onde ele est\u00e1, o matando. Ou ir como policial e algem\u00e1-lo. Ou talvez comprar uma seringa de drogas, levar a um cientista para descobrir o efeito dela e injet\u00e1-la no sistema de ventila\u00e7\u00e3o da sala, o deixando drogado, envenenado ou at\u00e9 mais forte.

Si haces lo que yo hago, es normal que no lo pases xD.\n\nTiene muy buena m\u00fasica de acompa\u00f1amiento, lo que hace una inmersi\u00f3n total. Cuando se pase el periodo de prueba, obviamente lo comprar\u00e9. Para mi gusto, no he visto a\u00fan ning\u00fan error, solo que en alguna ocasi\u00f3n la traducci\u00f3n al espa\u00f1ol est\u00e1 mal escrita, pero no afecta para nada. Teniendo encuenta que a\u00fan est\u00e1 en una versi\u00f3n alpha, le quedan muchas mejoras por introducir, y corregir los peque\u00f1os bugs que haya. Pero vuelvo a repetir, que he jugado ya bastantes horas y no he visto ninguno.\n\nSi quieres jugar un dungeon a lo loco haciendo lo que te plazca, asesinando, o sin asesinar, sobornando, drogando, etc, este es tu juego, no te vas a arrepentir.

But Dear God does it C R A S H. A. LOT.\n\n I mean... alot, alot. I would suggest waiting untill this game gets quite a bit more stable till it is even ready to play. Other than that, the game IS really fun.... until crash. (*sigh* it sucks because the game is really awesome!) \n\n- controls are soild. \n\n- Mechanincs are cool\n\n- The interactions between the classes/characters.

Just a tip, when hacking things like t.vs to blow up an enemy, hack it, cancel once they start to run away, let them get a good distance off looking for you, then hack again. This gives time for you to finish hack and blow up the t.v with them next to it. As assasin, try knocking on doors, vanishing, and then stabbing whoever answers from behind, best home invasion strategy. Also, if you find yourself fighting the terminator, do not try to stealth it, it wont shoot you in stealth mode but it will still follow you and you wont ever be at its back. Bartender is just good for shops, I like to use him when I am contaminating the air vents with cyanide or something. Also, cyanide is great, pop it in the vents and look!

I was expecting an unbalanced death trap with broken mechanics and simplistic graphics. Instead, I got a beautifully made game with multiple playstyles to choose from and a reward system that, unlike other rogue-likes, makes dying less frustrating. As well, I can begin to see how much potential it holds, especially with its customization. To put it simply, Streets of Rogue is a diamond in the rough that all gamers can enjoy.\n\nPros:\n + A wide range of characters/playstyles to choose from.\n + Gameplay is adaptable and allows for creativity.\n + Never a dull moment, especially when Disasters kick in.\n + In-game factions that are balanced in their benefit-to-consequence ratios.\n + The art style, though simplistic, has its charms and is very atmospheric.\n + The music is extremely fitting and it pumps me up beyond belief.\n + Multiplayer and Co-op for those who enjoy teamkilling and slaughtering your friends.\n + Make your game harder/easier by implementing 'hacks' such as everyone despising you or Creative Mode.\n + I was too lazy to break into a house so I blew it up with the equivalent of a nuke, killing at least 15 people and a gorilla.\n\nAs for the cons, please take into account that they are not meant to criticize and more to point out what Early Access (as of me writing this on 3/11/2017) has to offer at the moment.\n\nCons:\n - Missions can get a little repetitive.\n - Only two zones to play through (though this can be 'solved' by turning on Endless Mode).\n\nWhere it stands now, Streets of Rogue is an exhilirating experience but I can imagine how much fun it will be to play Co-op once I get my pals to play with me. It can be a little monotonous after a few hours but that is remedied by striving to unlock everything the game currently has to offer. I would give this enjoyable experience a 7.9/10.\n", "timestamp_created": 1489291565, "timestamp_updated": 1489291565, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499817", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30462049": {"recommendationid": "30462049", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040934507", "num_games_owned": 146, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 1030, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508292896}, "language": "english", "review": "Streets of Rogue is everything I ever wanted in a rouge like game.", "timestamp_created": 1489291408, "timestamp_updated": 1505005335, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480183", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30462012": {"recommendationid": "30462012", "author": {"steamid": "76561198211933296", "num_games_owned": 50, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 454, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489400352}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u65b0\u4eba\u8fd8\u662f\u63a8\u8350\u7528\u58eb\u5175\uff0c\u4e0d\u8981\u7528\u5e73\u6c11\u7a9f\u5c45\u6c11\u7b49\n\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u6709\u4e9b\u4e2d\u6587\u5b57\u4f53\u597d\u5c0f\uff0c\u5bc6\u5bc6\u9ebb\u9ebb\u7684\u770b\u4e0d\u6e05", "timestamp_created": 1489291227, "timestamp_updated": 1489291227, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30461959": {"recommendationid": "30461959", "author": {"steamid": "76561198292676716", "num_games_owned": 117, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2905, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 573, "last_played": 1514031761}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u867d\u7136\u59ec\u53cb\u4e0d\u505c\u7684\u6389\u7ebf\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd8\u662f\u4e00\u62ac\u5934\u5929\u4eae\u4e86\u2026\u2026\n\u76ee\u524d\u8054\u673a\u7684\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u72b6\u6001\u4e0d\u592a\u53cb\u597d\uff0c\u51fa\u73b0\u8fc7\u6389\u7ebf\u4e4b\u540e\u4eba\u7269\u8fd8\u5728\uff0c\u518d\u767b\u5f55\u4e4b\u540e\u753b\u9762\u4e0a\u51fa\u73b0\u4e24\u4e2a\u89d2\u8272\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u2190\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u8bdd\u8fc7\u5173\u65f6\u9700\u8981\u7684\u5168\u5458\u90fd\u4e0a\u7535\u68af\u53d8\u5f97\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\n\n\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e92\u76f8\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u6765\u554a\u4e92\u76f8\u4f24\u5bb3\u554a\uff08x\n\u2191\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e92\u76f8\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u7f3a\u70b9\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e0d\u5c0f\u5fc3\u6253\u5230\u59ec\u53cb\u7684\u968f\u4ece\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u968f\u4ece\u548c\u968f\u4ece\u603c\u8d77\u6765\u7136\u540e\u5c31\u6b7b\u5149\u4e86\u2026\u2026\n\u2191\u7528\u533b\u751f\u7684\u65f6\u5019\u4e0d\u5c0f\u5fc3\u6c2f\u4eff\u6342\u8138\u7136\u540e\u59ec\u53cb\u5c31\u8d77\u4e0d\u6765\u4e86\u2026\u2026\uff08\u5f53\u65f6\u7b11\u6210\u50bb13\uff09\u4f46\u662f\u8fd9\u6837\u6b7b\u6389\u7684\u8bdd\u4e0d\u4f1a\u6709\u7075\u9b42\u98d8\u51fa\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u4e0d\u80fd\u590d\u6d3b\uff0c\u867d\u8bf4\u53ef\u4ee5\u62d6\u5c38\u4e0b\u697c\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u8fd9\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6240\u6709\u7684\u9053\u5177\u5c31\u90fd\u6ca1\u4e86\n\n\u603b\u4f53\u6765\u8bf4\u662f\u4e2a\u597d\u6e38\u620f\u3002\u9002\u5408\u4e92\u76f8\u4f24\u5bb3", "timestamp_created": 1489291043, "timestamp_updated": 1489291043, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30461938": {"recommendationid": "30461938", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079867579", "num_games_owned": 309, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 721, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511584120}, "language": "english", "review": "Honestly one of the most fun games I have ever played.

I played this during the free weekend thing and I plan on purchasing this later.\n\nThere's a lot of attention to detail in this game. For example, in the tutorial, you could break down the door with your FISTS instead of opening it normally and the tutorial guy reacts with a \"WOAHHH THAT WAS AWESOME I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYONE OPEN A DOOR LIKE THAT\" (or equivalent). If you bust down the shopkeeper's door, she scolds you. If you kill her, the tutorial guy has a line of dialogue for that. If you kill a guy the tutorial guy wanted you to tranquilize, there's a different line of dialogue there too. If you walk into the ladies' bathroom, your boss reprimands you for it later on. It's really interesting seeing all the different reactions the characters have.\n\nThe dozens of classes allow for many, many different possible playstyles, and I've still yet to fully explore them all. So far, I've only really \"played\" one class- the doctor. That speaks to how much replayability is in this thing.\n\nIt's a really great game, and I definitely recommend it if you liked roguelikes like Wayward Souls or Pixel Heroes: Byte & Magic.

Play how you want to. Be a verteran soldier that has had too many wars for her/his lifetime and maim and blow things up or you can just do the missions and not disturb the \"peace\" that's cool too.\n\nMain point of the game is to kill some corrupt president (I know it's a mayor, president sounds cooler) dude, and to complete questionable tasks. You are allowed complete freedom on how you are going to complete (or fail) them. For example, you have to neutralise a few people, you can either just barge into there and be a brawler person and kill everybody or you can hire some gangsters to do the dirty work for you. Though be careful, everyone has hyper-alien intellect and can identify who hired the gangsters so, yeah keep that in mind.\n\nEach character is mainly different from each other, they each have their own unqiue ability which can assist them in some aspects. For example, the bartender (Probably my favourite character, I swear I don't drink, well in irl) can make some cocktails, which are some syringes or pills you use to make them, this disguises the syringes or pills as some cool drink you made in hospitality class. \nNote: You have traits for each character so like the \"Drug-a-lug\" trait allows you to see what effect each syringe does.\nYou can then give them to random people (test subjects) or drink it yourself to give you that certain effect after 5 seconds. The practical use of this is to give all the bad guys the bad cocktails and allies and you the good ones.\n\nThanks for reading my essay-like review thingy, I hope that you didn't fall asleep while reading this and you learnt a thing or two about this wonderful, creative and wacky game.

It also has a wacky sense of humor that, if fully realized with 100% complete levels and co-op, can keep players hooked for hours. Think Miami Heat meets a Saints Row approach to sandbox gameplay: the more creative and obsurd you play, the more fun you'll have.\n\nHOWEVER, right now the game is probably 25% complete. Characters and items are locked, and there are only two levels with 3 stages each for a total of 6 stages available. There is a hint of a story present, but it barely gets out of the introduction. Plus, the NPCs have typical filler dialogue that breaks the immersion (although this could be a design choice).\n\nOverall, it's hard to justify buying this at Early Access, but once it's completed, it'd be worth the $15.", "timestamp_created": 1489280834, "timestamp_updated": 1489280834, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30459810": {"recommendationid": "30459810", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049063810", "num_games_owned": 728, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 408, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502631045}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0418\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f. \n\u041d\u043e \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0434\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0430\u044e\u0449\u0430\u044f \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0431\u043b\u0435\u043c\u0430, \u044d\u0442\u043e \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044b\u0435 \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0441\u0438\u043d\u0445\u0440\u043e\u043d\u044b \u0432 \u043a\u043e\u043e\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0432\u0435. \u042d\u0442\u043e \u0440\u0435\u0448\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0441\u044c \u0441\u043e\u0437\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435\u043c \u043b\u043e\u043a\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0441\u0435\u0440\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0430 \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0441\u043e\u0435\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043a \u043d\u0435\u043c\u0443 \u0447\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0437 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043c\u043c\u0443 \u0432\u0438\u0440\u0442\u0443\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0441\u0435\u0442\u0438 Evolve.\n9.5 \\ 10  \u0421\u0442\u043e\u0438\u0442 \u0431\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c.", "timestamp_created": 1489280649, "timestamp_updated": 1489280649, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30459760": {"recommendationid": "30459760", "author": {"steamid": "76561198107443684", "num_games_owned": 479, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 849, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511588391}, "language": "english", "review": "Very fun!

Even if the rest of the zones are just carbon-copies of the others and don't offer much new, this game would still be decent. I'll illustrate this by describing a typical in-game scenario:\n\nOne of your \"Missions\" for the level is to rescue a prisoner from his cell. (The game is not a traditional \"get to the exit/beat the boss\" roguelite- To actually leave the level you need to resolve a set of random objectives) Here's a list of the ways you could do it:\n\n[list]\n[*] Insert cyanide (or any other poison item of your choice, provided it's strong enough) into the ventilation system to kill every guard in the building, and then proceed to get the keys and free the prisoner\n[*] Cut one of the windows out and lockpick the cell door\n[*] Blow open the wall\n[*] Stab yourself with a syringe of invisibilty to walk right into the building and rescue the prisoner from there\n[*] Break the door down and kill everything you see\n[*] Consume a pill that temporarily turns you into a supersized giant, and then proceed to literally stomp the building to pieces\n[/list]\n\nThat's probably the #1 strength of this roguelite- Choice. Generally the only different scenario approaches you get in roguelites is fight/flight or which combat playstyle you pick, but here you're given a massive array of different potential options and told to do what you want with them.\n\nThe massive variety of characters is also really amazing even at this early point in development: The Werewolf can become a combat god for 15 seconds, but that has a 20 second cooldown and makes him unable to do anything for 5 seconds after the ability runs out. The Cop can handcuff enemies from behind for a nonlethal elimination and is allied with other cops, but handcuffing/killing law-abiding citizens will give you heavy exp penalties. The Jock has huge levels of health and general strength, and can charge through walls, but is completely incapable of using computers. The large amount of characters (And the fact that this game already has mutators) gives it massive replay value already, and that's not even beginning to imagine what could come later.\n\nDo I have complaints/nitpicks at this point in development? Well:\n\n[list]\n[*] IMO the Syringes aren't done quite right yet. They're the standard \"Consumable item, and you don't know what it does when you first find it\" trope in other roguelites, but IMO their effects at this stage are pretty underwhelming. Several of their effects can already be reproduced by other items obtained in similar ways (For example, Cocaine gives you the \"Fast\" effect you'd sometimes find in a Syringe, Steriods grants \"Strength\" ecetera), and I've yet to find one that grants more permanent effects, which if you ask me is a bit lacking. It'd be cool to find Syringes that do really weird stuff or have permanent stat changes. Or better yet, be able to make your own ;)\n\n[*] This might just be because the game's currently quite short but I'm not personally feeling very much progression yet. Your character does level up, but the use of these levels is to get \"Traits\" at the end of the level, and while they are seriously awesome (eg. Wall's Worst Nightmare, that gives you a high chance, especially on critical hits, for knockback you inflict on enemies to physically slam them through walls, destroying the wall in the process) they don't do much for granting the feeling that you're growing stronger, at least for me. That might change as I play more, and the dev might not want the player to have access to things like higher HP values and so on, but IMO if the system's meant to give me the feeling like I'm significantly stronger at the end of the game than when I started, I'm not really feeling much of it.\n\n[*] IMO, security systems are really quite weak ATM. You'd think automated turrets would feel like a significant threat, but they need seperate surveillance cameras to even see you, and both the camera and the turret can be smashed in like two hits- And floor traps like crushers and trapdoors are so small in their activation range that it's unlikely you'll step on one (I think a tripwrire would serve as a better trigger). While they do an alright job at setting off the alarm, when I'm playing a hacker and set an enemy's security systems against them, I'd expect pretty big rewards for doing that, but in my experience the enemy just punches out the turret before it can kill anything.\n\n[*] In my experience, items like safe crackers aren't useful enough at the moment as just getting the safe combination is really easy in most cases. IMO safe combinations should sometimes come in 2-part chunks (Or even be in seperate buildings, with the building it's contained in revealed in a note on the safe), as just knocking out the shopkeep when nobody's looking and grabbing all his cash is about as easy as teleporting through the wall and cracking the safe, which probably shouldn't be the case.\n\n[*] More nonlethal options are kind of a must currently- Your #1 source of nonlethal will be your character's ability (if it caters to nonlethal), and if you're lucky you'll have a tranq gun. IMO we should have things like chloroform canisters, gas grenades, tasers, and ecetera.\n[/list]\n\nHowever, pretty much all of that is solveable by more content- And if that's what this game gets, it'll be a seriously great game that stands out among other roguelites. And that's saying a lot, as this game has no shortage of competition.", "timestamp_created": 1489265398, "timestamp_updated": 1489265398, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.477273", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30456017": {"recommendationid": "30456017", "author": {"steamid": "76561198210429461", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 216, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489263664}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Simplemente perfecto :,v", "timestamp_created": 1489265143, "timestamp_updated": 1489265143, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30456009": {"recommendationid": "30456009", "author": {"steamid": "76561198321268728", "num_games_owned": 696, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 109, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489767999}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5f88\u65e9\u4e4b\u524d\uff0c\u770b\u8fc7\u738b\u8001\u83ca\u505a\u8fd9\u6b3e\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u611f\u89c9\u4e0d\u9519\uff0c\u65e0\u8bba\u662f\u6253\u51fb\u611f\u8fd8\u662f\u64cd\u63a7\u624b\u611f\u90fd\u5f88\u597d\uff0c\u559c\u6b22\u50cf\u7d20\u98ce\u7684\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u611f\u89c9\u56de\u5230\u4e86\u5c0f\u65f6\u5019\u8ddf\u54e5\u54e5\u4eec\u73a94399\u7684\u5c0f\u6e38\u620f\u4e00\u68372333\uff0c\u53e6\u5916\u8fd9\u6b3e\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u5236\u4f5c\u7ec4\u7279\u522b\u9017\uff0c\u601d\u60f3\u7279\u522b\u5f00\u653e\uff0c\u6e38\u620f\u91cc\u7684AI\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e0d\u6309\u5957\u8def\u51fa\u724c\uff0c\u603b\u4f1a\u6709\u83ab\u540d\u7684\u559c\u611f\uff0c\u989d- -\u5269\u4e0b\u7684\u662f\u548c\u8c10\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fd9\u6b3e\u6e38\u620f\u76ee\u524d\u662f\u539f\u6c41\u539f\u5473\u8fd8\u6ca1\u906d\u5230\u9609\u5272\uff08\u867d\u7136\u6e38\u620f\u91cc\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\u5404\u79cd\u201c\u9609\u5272\u201d\uff09\uff0c\u80fd\u4f53\u4f1a\u5230\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u66b4\u529b\u5feb\u611f\u3002\u603b\u4e4b\u975e\u5e38\u63a8\u8350\u8fd9\u6b3e\u5c0f\u6e38\u620f~\u559c\u6b22\u50cf\u7d20\u98ce\u7684\u670b\u53cb\u4eec\u53ef\u4ee5\u51fa\u624b\u4e86\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1489265109, "timestamp_updated": 1489265109, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30455979": {"recommendationid": "30455979", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118593663", "num_games_owned": 85, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 880, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489357626}, "language": "english", "review": "This is one of those ideas that I'm amazed nobody had sooner.

I think this would make a very excellent live streaming series for my livestreams. So now that those things are out of the way...on to the review.\n\nI don't leave many reviews because sometimes I let my streams speak for the game. This game however I wanted to see if I liked it before I threw the 14 bucks at the game to play it all the way through. There are more pros than cons to this. I love the easy tutorial. I understood the controls on my gamepad very quickly and the fact this has full controller support in early access is amazing because it makes it easier for me to grasp the controls. I love how each 'maze' in the level has missison that you have to complete, and the mutations make the game very funny yet challenging to me.\n\nThe only con I have for this is the multiplayer. I tried to invite a friend of mine to a game, and she was unable to connect to the game. So we tried it the opposite way, and still no connection. [We tried the invites through steam due to her not being able to find my game in the online game list.] So maybe fix multiplayer a bit better to where friends can join up through steam....unless I was doing something wrong which I knew I wasn't at the time. \n\nOverall....I am purchasing this game soon and I can't wait to see what this game has in store!", "timestamp_created": 1489256111, "timestamp_updated": 1489256111, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30452922": {"recommendationid": "30452922", "author": {"steamid": "76561198284572043", "num_games_owned": 75, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 138, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489281694}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Rogue-Like perfecto :)", "timestamp_created": 1489255829, "timestamp_updated": 1489255829, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495050", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30452904": {"recommendationid": "30452904", "author": {"steamid": "76561198128418462", "num_games_owned": 139, "num_reviews": 115, "playtime_forever": 27, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489261477}, "language": "french", "review": "oula! a peine 10 minute et je vois deja l'enorme potentiel que peut offrir ce jeu, il a de tres bonne id\u00e9e! je regrette pas de l'avoir essayer dans sa periode d'essaie :3 hop dans ma liste de souhait, je ferai evidement une critique plus constructive dessus a l'avenir. ps: le b\u00e9b\u00e9 des dev de speedrunner nous montre ce quil a dans le bide!", "timestamp_created": 1489255745, "timestamp_updated": 1489255745, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.456052", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30452643": {"recommendationid": "30452643", "author": {"steamid": "76561198219246684", "num_games_owned": 52, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1220, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502536084}, "language": "english", "review": "Quality fam 420/420", "timestamp_created": 1489255016, "timestamp_updated": 1489255016, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499147", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30452624": {"recommendationid": "30452624", "author": {"steamid": "76561198090382646", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 158, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489253615}, "language": "english", "review": "The levels are actually quite plain and it is fill with the same npc which makes it look very dull there isn't much difference from the first level to the end of the level.

I played this during a free weekend and liked it so much I bought it. This here is a game with A LOT of a potential that does well with what it has. It's not even remotely done and it's still *very* interesting. I also see a lot of positive attributes in the development team and that makes me extremely optimistic as to the future of this game.\n\nGameplay is a free-roam hotline miami/river city ransom/GTA 2/roguelike. The roguelike park is not fleshed out yet; you can play an endless mode but players currently have no problem getting into the hundreds apparently. It's very early though and it is obvious he has plans for this. The gameplay is rad and satisfing regardless.\n\n-The developer is endeering and focused. He is active and responsive on the steam discussion forum, is constantly working on the game, and he's very accepting of feedback. There's even a main menu function to submit feedback on the fly. This is a man that tries hard, works hard, and deserves that cash.\n\n-Sound design is pretty solid. Music fits the game, although there needs to be more. The sound effects all sound good and satisfying.\n\n-Graphicals are adequate - they don't impress or bother (the levels are procedurally generated: while the textures all look good, the level generation needs detail work. It is very functional, just needs more props and interactables)\n\nI only have two formal complaints:\n1. The banner art needs work (which has nothing to do with the game): http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/512900/header.jpg?t=1489647124\n\n2. I'm not even sure if this has anything to do with me buying this game, and it especially has nothing to do with the game itself, but ever since I bought, favorited, rated this game up, etc, my steam store keeps showing me every single pixel roguelike in the steam store and my god they are all just utter trash. How many do I have to \"Not Interested\"? Sorry games, you just don't compare to this one.\n\nI cannot recommend this game enough.

There are unlockable things in the main hub(ala Rogue Legacy), unlocking all sort of new traits(level up thingy), rewards, and even choose other optional items for your said chosen class! It's pretty cool!\n\nThere are only 2 areas of this early access thingamajig, but hey, 3 more to come, can't help but wait it out.\n\nOh, and you can do anything you oh-so desire. Wanna kill EVERYONE? Go ahead. Wanna kill NOONE?? Go ahead. Again. WANNA REIGN TERROR UPON THE WORLD?! Wait, that is like the same thing as the first thing I said. EH.\n\nSo as of writing this reviwwe, I have amassed 119 minutes(I think). And I'll make sure to come back.\n\nOh, and the answer is Merlot. Fuck vodka, get drunk with style bruh/\n\nYeah, that's the rewieiw thing.\n\nGo home idk", "timestamp_created": 1489252060, "timestamp_updated": 1489252060, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2,

Crap.\n\nBear in mind I've been playing this game since it's Itch.Io days, so the hours shown here are about twice as low as it should show, and that I'm not a guy who enjoys rogue likes at all.\n\nWith that said, this game is AMAZING. The amount of things you can do in it is beyond massive, and every session can feel different.\n\nSo basically, what is this game about? You play as one of around 6-8 available starting characters and you start climbing through randomly generated floors to (eventually, probably, and not in the alpha...ly) kill the corrupt mayor of your city. During each run, by performing rather easy tasks, you unlock characters, and earn chicken nuggets (a form of currency with which you'll be able to purchase traits that could possibly show up whenever you level up).\n\nGameplay: It's a top down brawler. You can get access to guns, flamethrowers, machine guns, shotguns and a variety of science weapons and melee weapons. Each character has it's own benefits, Gorillas, for example (and yes, you can play as gorillas), are very powerful and tanky, but can't use computers and speak to humans, Assassins, on the other hand, can become invisible and backstab, but have limited HP. Shapeshifters can steal NPCs bodies and use them against other NPC, however be warned, because if your NPC is killed while you're using it, you'll be thrown out and have a portion of your HP removed as well.\n\nIf the characters don't provide enough variety for you (and, like I mentioned, there are more available characters for use I haven't even mentioned), you may get a kick out of trying the random drops of loot and items, syringes, for example, may provide buffs, or debuffs, depending on the syringe  (which will most likely be unidentifiable for you unless you have special traitrs or identify wands). You can either inject them directly to yourself, polute the air ducts of a building with them, or with one of the crazy unlockable consumables (like shrink pellets, or rage bottles).\n\nEven with all the possibilities I mentioned, it's hard to imagine the game is only in alpha, and includes both online and offline co-op, and in the future, more features will be added (Map seeds, Player-made mutators and your own custom character!)\n\nI can't recommend this game enough, it's fantastic in it's current form (Although there are only 6 levels, highly replayable, though) and there are more things to be added on top of it.\n\nLovers of the roguelike genres will highly enjoy this game, even if it's a bit easier than most roguelikes (Which, in my book, is a benefit).", "timestamp_created": 1489243801, "timestamp_updated": 1489243801, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.539610", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30448799": {"recommendationid": "30448799", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079345997", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1159, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490455784}, "language": "english", "review": "A good idea ruined by a lack of ways to actually approach situations, poor balancing and awful AI.

I haven't tried it yet, but thinking about all the chaos makes me want to. Different characters has different traits which lets you approach situations totally different. Like others said, there are multiple ways and multiple. I'd love to see this game succeed so we can see where the game goes. But it is totally playable and fun in this state.

I can at least say I'm excited to see the full product, and very much look forward to picking it up eventually. \n\nI found the difficulty to be somewhat lacking, but I didn't see any immediate options to increase or lower it, though I'm 99% sure there is. \n\nMy first two levels as the Slum Dweller was amusing. I really enjoy having to find items/weapons around the map to accomplish objectives. The maps are decent sized, and the style looks good. My first time bashing someone through a wall was one of thee most entertaining things. Everything else is icing on the cake. \nHaving unlocked Harambe right away, I couldn't help but try him. Well Gorilla is a bit OP; I breezed through the game playing as them. \n\nMelee feels good, guns feel good, and stealth is rewarding.

I thought I'd get that out the way before the inevitable influx of cry babies. \n\nThe game is marketed as a co-op, shooter, brawler, stealth, roguelike RPG. The irony is this game is missing the one title that it ends up being - survival. And that is part of the game's identity crisis. The game gives you so many options that the execution suffers, mainly due to progressive RPG leveling with a punishing one-life-then-dead mechanic. This is like making a speedrunning stealth game. The two concepts don't work together. Whoever thinks spending an hour building up your character and arsenal to then randomly die to an invisible floor trap is a fun concept is being fooled by the game's free weekend. It's not fun at the game's current pacing, and I certainly wouldn't pay \u00a310.99 for it. I've put hundreds of hours into games such as FTL and Rogue Legacy and it didn't feel nearly as deflating to die to randomness in those games, as you could generally get back to where you was within fifteen minutes. \n\nBottom line: the pacing of Streets of Rogue is too slow. Which is baffling considering how action packed the trailers are. If you attempt any of the stuff in the trailers you'll be dead prompty, selecting a new character again, and the prospect of losing all that progression stifles your urge to go around causing mayhem. Higher health bars and more food pick ups would help, but it's not really addressing the problem. \n\nPeople are likening the game to Deus Ex, due to the amount of options available to you. But it's flawed. You can be a stealthy thief, but if you mess up you're punching people. You can be a soldier, but you only have a few bullets and then you're punching people. You can roll with a gang, but when your members die, you're just punching people. 99% of what you can do boils down to punching people, which makes most classes irrelevant after the first level, because you will inevitably test out all your perishable gear and then your class is just the same as all the others. Thus classes with melee bonuses end up being innately better (looking at you, Gorilla!). \n\nIf this was a Beat Em Up, fair enough. But the game tries to be so many things that it falls flat in any one area, and all the cool strategies and ideas you think to try end up mashing the RT button after five minutes. \n\nThere's no progression, only the illusion of progression. It's a roguelike. One death and you're back at the start. The game is probably a lot more fun with friends, but reviewing a game based on how fun the multiplayer is feels like a cop-out. Really bad games can be fun with friends, and the idea of having a few friends round with some pizza and punching shit in this game actually sounds like a blast! But the solo experience felt like treading on eggshells around everyone to avoid losing the character I'd built up, which goes counter-intuitive to a game that wants you to test things out. \n\nBare in mind this review was written after an hour of solo play.

There are many ways to approach each objective or quest and that's where the fun comes in. Will you run and gun your way through while taking mutiple enemies at once? Will you set up distractions and pick off the enemies one by one? Will you set your enemies against eachother and then go in at the end as a clean-up crew? Or will you just stealth your way through?\n\nFor a game in Alpha I can do nothing but reccomend it. The developer is active on his discord channel. Things this game has coming. \n\nSeeding - This is a Rogue Like game which means perma death. However with seeds you will be able to play the same world more than once. This also opens up oppurtunities for racing your friends.\n\nCustom Characters - Streets of Rogue has many unlockable and playable characters to choose from. But in the future you will be able to create your own. \n\nCustom Mutators - Currently in order to spice the game up you can play with mutators, an extra set of rules that the game applies beforehand to each level. For example one of them makes it so the game runs at 1.3 speed making everything faster. Another makes it so everybody has rocket launchers! Custom mutators are on their way and then it's up to you to decide what happens.\n\nMore items - This game has a variety of items and gadgets. With more to come!\n\nNew levels - As of right now the game only has a small amount of levels and worlds. But the new ones will be added later and in the mean time there is a mutator that works as sort of a new game plus type deal.\n\nThis game is totaly worth the money it costs and it's not even close to being finished yet.\n\nAlso if you ever get bored playing alone...There is Local and Online Co-op!", "timestamp_created": 1489205145, "timestamp_updated": 1489205145, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1,

(informal, disapproving) weak and not successful; synonym feeble.\nhttps://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/pathetic?q=pathetic\n\n\"Tedious\":\nlasting or taking too long and not interesting; synonym boring.\nhttps://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/tedious?q=tedious\n\nThus, I accurately described this game, no further commentaries needed.\n\nNext is, commentaries, posted in harsh manner without any developed reason and by people who do not even know how i played this game.\n\"Nice 3.4 hours. Very smart person it seems.\"; \"Awww, someone doesn't know how to even play this game...\"; \"Boring from 0 play time? Pathetic and tedious after 5 minutes? Then plays for another 3 hours? mmkay.\"; \"3.4 hours worth of pathetic and tedious, apparently.\" .\n\nWell, for 3.4 hours i almost completed this game and it become boring way more quicker than i expected, so it's not utterly ugly experience, but final thought and overall feeling was in that state, indeed.\n\nI could elaborate more on that if somebody really want it and cares about it.\nBut i think you don't.\nI think for now this steam page in store just filled with absolute blind fanaticism of teenage fanboys and intolerable cruelty to others, who isn't in their fan-club.\n\nJust look at the score of my review (not if i care, but it shows something):\n\n4 of 65 people (6%) found this review helpful\n2 people found this review funny\n\nOh, yeah! And i did played this game in one set.

There is an open world, that responds in a variety of logical ways to actions that happen within it, both the player and NPCs can act upon the world, there are many tools players and NPCs have access to and many actions they can choose take. On top of all that there are varied and interesting goals for the player to accomplish. It all adds up for unpredictable gameplay where the player is encouraged to experiment. Examples:\n\nI had to kill a drug dealer, who was surrounded by powerful guards. So I bought a drug from the dealer that made me HUGE, took the drug, got HUGE and smashed my way through him and his guards. Not only did the guards and dealer get smashed, but I destroyed the entire building in the process. When that was done the drug hadn't worn off yet, so I smashed through the walls of another building to complete a different mission.\n\nI had to assassinate a prisoner in a guarded complex. There was a window near his cell with an explosive trip wire. I threw a rock through the window, setting off the bomb, hurting my target and destroying the wall of his cell. While the wounded prisoner tried to escape a guard gunned him down, mission accomplished!\n\nThere are a great variety of characters you can choose to be which mixes up gameplay. You can be a gorilla who has massive strength but can't speak to NPCs. A hacker who is super weak but can hack any computer he wants. There's perks you can unlock and weapons and all sorts of things to mix up how you play.\n\nThe one downside is that there are only 6 levels. Randomly generated levels yes, but still only 6. The dev seems like a good guy and I expect the game has a very bright future. Oh and the game is pretty funny too!\n\nIt is great.

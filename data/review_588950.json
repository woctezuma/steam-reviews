You begin Kingsway just like any other RPG game, create your character, pick a class, and get thrown into the game with limited tutorials so that you can figure it out on your own. It was actually very easy to pick up and play, and the operating system aesthetic of the game allows players to have the game layout be however they want. It basically offered a whole new level of player choice that I found really enjoyable. Onto the actual gameplay itself. You select areas on the map you want to travel to and as your character moves, you run into various monsters that you will have to fight. Monsters can drop loot upon defeating them that the player can use to their advantage, or just become a horder. But the amount of random loot frops, weapons, and skills that the player can obtain guarantees that you will have a different experience with every playthrough. The world is also randomized so the player will also be met with new dungeons, maps, and possibilities with every new character they make. It makes it hard to develop a strategy, which just gives it that much more replay value.\n\nSo lets just quick run through the pros:\n-Amazing user interface\n-Infinite replay value\n-Easy to pick up\n-Genuinely fun\n-Player gets to choose how they want to play\n\nBut now lets talk about the fatal flaw I mentioned, and that is that the game is not infinite, and you can not keep using the same character forever. The game is set on a small island and the player must move from the left side of the island to the right in order to avoid an evil shadow monster that is set to cover the world in darkness. At the end of the island lies the final boss, where *SPOILER ALERT* the player sacrifices themself to defeat the shadow monster. Your character dies, and this game does have permadeath, so thats where the game ends, and you can decide there to either make a new character or just quit. I would have loved the option to have an infinite world and carry my character up trhough level 100 and fight insanely difficult monsters, and be able to grind for EXP and go on quests. But sadly the game will foce you to face the final boss anywhere from 2 - 4 hours into the game, and then you either die, or win and also die. I just completed the game for the first time after 11 attempts and I dont know if I can play it again knowing I already experienced everything this game has to offer. Let me make this clear, the game really only has one story that you just repeat over and over again. It was a fun ride but now the ride is just over, and I dont even have my character to show for it.\n\n8/10", "timestamp_created": 1514171550, "timestamp_updated": 1514172149, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522059", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38638374": {"recommendationid": "38638374", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994199732", "num_games_owned": 373, "num_reviews": 83, "playtime_forever": 310, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 310, "last_played": 1514152823}, "language": "english", "review": "Kingsway is a rogue-light, You're a fantasy adventurer who has to travel the lands, light the beacons, and get to the king's castle. Its main gimmick is that the entire game is reminiscent of the win98/95 era in terms of interface. \n\nYour bags are windows and icons on the desktop, enemies sometimes shoot projectiles in the forms of popups you have to close before they hit you, the enemies themselves sort of drift around the screen at times.  The playable classes are pretty similiar, and even share a bunch of skills between them.  The gameplay isn't bad, it's just lacking in any sort of depth.\n\n They hit upon a wonderful premise of a classic windows style operating system to play the game in, and then barely do anything with it. Oh, one enemy minimizes your windows, great. A few enemies place a couple of annoying popups on your screen. It's so restrained with its gimmicks that after the first hour or so none of them have any impact on you. Compared to undertale, which took its \"dodge'em up lite bullet hell\" concept and explored plenty of different attack patterns and silly gimmicks, Kingsway doesn't.

If you're not familiar with those genres, this means that there is permadeath, and the crux of the game is managing resources against a timer (in Kingsway's case, the arrival of a Galactus-style world eating alien known as The Sky Eater) rather than plot. \n\nThe main genius of the game is the user interface. If you've used a PC for any period of time, it'll be pretty immediately intuitive how to do things. It's a game that barely needs to tutorialize because you're already on a PC.\n\nThe classes also do a fantastic job of feeling different from each other, and having multiple viable builds. My glass cannon mage ripped through everything before getting hit, while my adventurer focused on shields and slow, strong attacks, nullifying all damage before killing things in a few, big hits. There's no doubt in my mind I could have pushed them (or the other classes I've played) in multiple viable directions, and it's tons of fun experimenting, figuring out what works, then taking a honed build to absolutely murder things.\n\nThe one thing I'd caution people on is if you're a roguelike diehard it might be slightly easy for you. I've only got a dozen hours of experience, and I feel like at this point if I can get established in the first fifteen minutes I'm making it to endgame. I haven't done a ton of experimentation yet with the Ring of Pain starting item (which tooltips denote as a hard mode), so that might ratchet up the difficulty. Even so, I think that the user interface and really great class design is a good enough hook to get a few dozen hours of enjoyment out of this. For 10 bucks?

Good as an indie game, but don't expect too much.\nMy review is a bit harsh, I'll admit it, but the game isn't bad. It's just that I hyped too much and expected much more of it. My first run was a blast, if you only want to try out you'll have lots of fun. But if you want more, don't expect much for now.\n\nI'll be honest, Kingsway looks more like a self-made project you'd do for your early portfolios than a real, finished game. I've still liked it so I'll recommend it anyway.\n\nFirst of all, don't be fooled by my big play time. 40% of it is time spent AFK/alt-tabbed but with the game opened, and a good chunk was me testing the limits of the game. I maybe got 15 hours of real gameplay, though I would've been done much faster if I didn't go for 100%.\n\nSo, the game is buggy. Are those gamebreaking bugs that make it impossible to play? No, but they're annoying when you notice them.\n\nPassive effects don't stack. I had the Keen skill (+1 stats on lvlup) and got another one from a boss gear. Didn't get my promised 5 points each level, still 4. Haven't made the maths on Bandage, but I didn't seem to heal much with two of it either.\nYou can enchant and disenchant items infinitely, but if you leave the game with an enchanted item it'll get stuck when you come back: you'll be able to disenchant it, but not enchant it back (its name won't change either when you disenchant).\nSkill books will tell you if you can't learn a skill of if you already know the level 5, but for skills that have only one level the books will get consumed for no benefit.\nEnding #5 didn't give me the Beastkin End achievement, though I did it as Beastkin.\nI'm probably forgetting some more.\n\nThere are design choices I disagree with.\nMany items give you a very vague description. I still have no idea what Lucky Coin is supposed to do, I barely used Potion of Attack until I found out the only drawback for overconsumption was poison (drink them all, antidote, poof)\nSome items have no purpose... at all. I still have no idea what I'm supposed to do with these Strange Rubble and Horns, all I'm told is that \"someone may want this\"\nNowhere in the game are you told how to get a Full Rune. It's not that complicated, but it's near impossible to do anyway. I cleared all caves each run, and I regularly stocked up on one or two runes, getting sometimes a third as well. But all 4? Good luck.\nYou find healing wells in which you can drop and pick up coins. One at a time. What it does is cool, but without a touchpad to go faster it's horrible.\nYou can find level 11-13 gear on mobs level 5. With bags so limited in size, not very useful.\nEnchanting an item increases its level requirement by 1. If you keep disenchanting and re-enchanting an item, it will eventually require a level you can't even reach (you usually reach level 20 but an item can ask hundreds, see my screenshots). And the bonuses aren't scaling with level, a level 1 ring can be enchanted to require level 20 and still be a crappy +1 str.\nSkill speed don't make sense. Two skills with the same shown speed have clearly different cast speeds, like Black Fireball and Astral Storm : both are \"Very Slow\", but AS is like 3 or 4 times faster than BF.\nAgility is worthless, I spent like 90% of my points into it and I wasn't much faster than monsters. My Mage with 3 Agility was just as fast.\nThe only scrolls that have a noticeable effect are the healing scrolls, in combat the time to use them you're likely to miss an attack. They're just not worth it.\n\nFinally, the game is fairly easy. If you can survive through the first two or three levels you're almost sure to go to the end. Gold is an issue very early, but you quickly get flooded with it and you can't even spend it all unless you keep hopping between shops to buy stuff. The hardest part is managing weight, because I'm a hoarder, but the extra gold isn't very impactful.\nYou can go all the way with only the basic attack and a heal spell (if you can learn it or find a book), I've even leveled up my MAGE by bashing people manually (even though all my stat points were put in intel), and only switched to spells when I got a high level Black Fireball (that got quicly replaced when I found a book of Astral Storm). All you have to do is put your first few stat points in strength to double your damage. The special pop-up attacks are not a big deal, even if you don't put any point in agility. Really, I died only twice during my runs: when I wasn't paying attention at all, and when I tried hard mode with the weakest class (two bandits when you deal 0 damage as first battle isn't easy). \n", "timestamp_created": 1512260655, "timestamp_updated": 1512260655, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37977186": {"recommendationid": "37977186", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012792251", "num_games_owned": 729, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 214, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512090198}, "language": "english", "review": "This game goes hard after Windows 95 nostalgia (if that's a thing?) and absolutely nails it. It's a pretty basic RPG style game where you have to travel around a world lighting 3 beacons to unlock an end boss. There are 4 different classes with different abilities and spells available to learn but I'm not really that sure about the variety because, despite there being permadeath, I actually finished the game with my second character and I'm not feeling the desire to replay the game for a few reasons.\n\nThe aesthetic is just really cool and fits with the game's mechanics really well. Your character sheet, the world map and bags are all just icons on the desktop that you open up and can move around and resize at your will, which is actually important because space management on the screen and clutter became a bit of an issue. Things like travel time and attack timers are all loading bars, and the combat is real time and uses the windows in pretty interesting ways. Each enemy opens a new pop-up window and moves around the screen slowly outside of your control while you're clicking on buttons in the window to execute the combat. Some monsters have special abilities that fuck around with this too, there's a shadow bandit who occasionally uses his turn to minimise his window so he's just attacking in the background while you're frantically trying to get the combat back open. Some monsters shoot arrows that are a small window with a \"dodge\" button on that fly across your screen from right to left and there are a small number of other spells that use a variety of moving windows with dodge buttons. The issue with combat is that everything is great fun and makes you panic the first time you see it but then extremely quickly becomes 2nd nature which reduces the combat to spamming the attack button over and over with minor breaks. You also see all of the different in combat effects early on and after that just meet stronger versions of the same monsters so it really doesn't develop in a way I thought it could after seeing the cool things it was doing in the first 30 minutes, almost as if they ran out of ideas.\n\nThe game took 3 hours to finish, across both characters, so it's very short. That actually turns out to be a bit of a blessing because it was getting very repetitive for me already. The most frustrating part is that the final area of the game is absolutely full of random encounters with absolutely no variety. None of the enemies cast spells forcing you to react or do anything interesting with your windows, so you just spam attack until they die and move on to the next irritatingly frequent random encounter. There are a load of unlocks that carry across characters such as health boosts or starting items so I guess they want you to replay the game multiple times but I have no interest in playing it again, it's looks alone are what got me to finish the first run. It's a really neat game and I'd definitely check out a future Kingsway 2 but the first iteration falls short in a few places for me. 6/10", "timestamp_created": 1512137377, "timestamp_updated": 1512137519, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37966527": {"recommendationid": "37966527", "author": {"steamid": "76561198235503780", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2384, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512707676}, "language": "english", "review": "I have not been able to stop playing this game.

Un [strike]rogue[/strike]lite qui m'a fait un peu penser \u00e0 [I]Knights of Pen & Paper[/I] dans sa structure : on avance de points en points sur une map vue du dessus, on se tape des combats al\u00e9atoires (qui s'exp\u00e9dient assez rapidement) au tour par tour durant les d\u00e9placements entre ces points. Le jeu consiste \u00e0 aller allumer trois flambeaux pour pouvoir acc\u00e9der au ch\u00e2teau final et d\u00e9foncer le boss de fin. C'est tr\u00e8s classique et assez simpliste aussi bien pour ce qui est du sc\u00e9nar' que du gameplay ; le jeu se d\u00e9marque surtout par son interface qui reprend un bureau d'ordinateur dans (sur ?) lequel chaque fen\u00eatre correspond soit \u00e0 la map, soit \u00e0 l'inventaire, soit aux statut de notre personnage, etc. \u00e7a rajoute un petit truc en combat puisque la fen\u00eatre du combat se d\u00e9place sur l'\u00e9cran (en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral pas trop vite) de sorte qu'il est parfois un peu compliqu\u00e9 de cliquer au bon moment sur le bouton d'attaque ou de d\u00e9fense, mais aussi d'aller cliquer dans une autre fen\u00eatre pour utiliser une potion, etc.\n\nL'id\u00e9e n'est pas mauvaise et donne clairement une identit\u00e9 assez sympa au jeu, mais \u00e7a reste de l'ordre du gimmick plut\u00f4t que de la vraie bonne id\u00e9e de gameplay, d'autant que les situations rencontr\u00e9es en jeu sont assez peu vari\u00e9es et que, contrairement \u00e0 d'autres \"rogue-lite\", on ne d\u00e9bloque pas grand chose qui pourrait raviver l'int\u00e9r\u00eat pour le jeu au fur et \u00e0 mesure de nos parties. A peine quelques options pour un gift de d\u00e9part, et des h\u00e9ros avec de nouvelles stats.

You will have bad runs until you do some research on what works and what doesn't and the game takes too long (takes me about 2-3 hours on a successful run) for the learning process to be enjoyable. \n\nThe impression I got from the trailers was not how the game felt but stuck with it and had a good time. Definitely not for everyone. Made me wish it was a traditional rpg that was more about puzzle and reactionary gameplay (the popups were incredibly fun but lackings) instead of the simple roguelike that it is.", "timestamp_created": 1510379407, "timestamp_updated": 1510379407, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.617966", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36422540": {"recommendationid": "36422540", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045564189", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 419, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505757417}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\ud5c8\ub2c8\uc7bc", "timestamp_created": 1510331931, "timestamp_updated": 1510331931, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36418310": {"recommendationid": "36418310", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059576788", "num_games_owned": 210, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 306, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510874226}, "language": "english", "review": "The gimmick of playing like an OS doesn't get boring, the developer came up with some very interesting game mechanics that take advantage of it.

This means you'll navigate the world via progress bars, manage your inventory like you would files in folders, get quests as spam e-mails, and fight off enemies that appear as pop-ups. To be honest, the game doesn't really use this gimmick as much more than window dressing \u2014 the most interesting gameplay twists are how enemy windows move around during combat, adding a very light annoyance to clicking on battle commands, and how some enemies cast spells that appear as moving pop-ups that can be closed to avoid their effects. \n\nThe depth and challenge the game provides is also a bit sparse. I've beaten the game thrice, each time using a different class, but played them virtually identically by dumping all of my stat points into Strength and all of my skill points into the shared passive Vigilance (first few attacks are faster) and any other passive that would increase the power of my damage and criticals. While there are spells to learn, some unique to each class, you only have five spots on your hotbar you can slot them into, and honestly there's no reason to care when you can instead have your critical attacks stun and leech health at no cost.\n\nCombat in this game is a barebones, normally one-on-one affair that has a typical loop of \"get in as many hits as possible, then block before the enemy's attack bar fills all the way up.\" Of course, if you manage your build like mentioned above and accumulate enough good equipment over your travels \u2014 which is easy to do naturally \u2014 you'll eventually get to a point where you'll just spam attack at everything and never die. \n\nTo be fair, I haven't tried either of the magic-focused classes, the challenge class that only has one arm, or the unlockable Hard Mode yet, but to say the least you probably won't be putting a lot of care into your decisions like other roguelikes tend to demand. The most pressure the game puts on you is a shadow that slowly envelops the game world from left to right as time goes on, replacing regular enemy encounters with a sole \"Shadow\" enemy that hits fairly hard but is still easy to kill.\n\nAfter you successfully finish the game at one of its five endings, you will earn gems you can use to unlock better starting gifts for future runs, as well as some hotkeys and visual customization options. Again, these leave a bit to be desired, as after one run you will probably have enough gems to get your preferred starting item (IMO, the Large Bag), the hotkeys are not actually all that useful, and the customizations are limited to two additional window color themes, some mouse cursors, and making the font uglier or unreadable. It would have been really cool to be able to unlock customization options that dramatically change the look of the game like different game icons or tilesets, or at least complete control over theme colors, but sadly that isn't the case.\n\nIn spite of all of my criticisms, I still like Kingsway a lot. Going on a miniature adventure, one without any of the stresses that most roguelikes entail, killing silly-looking monster pop-ups and shoving loot into my bag-folders, all while some cheesy fantasy MIDIs play in the background, is just a nice way to zone out and relax.

A fairly standard roguelike in a lot of ways, but solidly made.\n\nGameplay: In terms of raw gameplay, the game is solid. Not the best I've ever played, but it's not bad either. The way enemies 'dodge' your attacks by moving the entire window is strange, but it works well. Many non-combat encounters take the form of short choose-your-own-adventure type sequences. It is a bit shallow in terms of content at the moment, but hopefully there will be updates to fix that in the future. 7.5/10\n\nMusic: The music isn't anything that's going to be stuck in your head; no amazing atmosphere like in Bastion. But it's pleasant enough, and is good at evoking the nostalgic feel of old-school gaming. 8/10. Note, you do have to turn the music on manually in game, which is slightly amusing, but I find it a little awkward (although not enough to actually take a point off).\n\nVisuals: It's not super-HD triple A visuals, but the game has a style, and it sticks to it. Everything is neat and tidy, nothing feels overwhelming, and the UI is pretty clean and, due to the theming, highly customizable. 8/10.\n\nStory/Lore: The story is mostly an excuse plot... or at least seems to be at first. It's slightly deeper than it looks, but at the same time, it's not really the game's main draw. Still, while the story and lore aren't necessarily deep, what is there is good enough for a game of this kind. 7/10\n\nReplay Value: This one could go either way. There are a variety of classes and potential builds, as well as multiple endings, so if you don't mind the non-combat events beng a bit same-y, then the replay value is solid. You can think of it sort of like a board game with a limited deck of event cards; you'll see them all eventually, but that doesn't mean you can't keep playing the game. That said, I doubt I'll be playing this game a year from now unless it gets some major updates... but considering the price, I expect I'll get my money's worth. 7/10.\n\nOther notes: The game does have a soft time-limit of sorts, in the form of the Sky Eater's Shadow. There are ways around it, but if time limits bother you, you might want to wait until alternate campaigns are added. Also, while there is a permanent progression system, in the form of using Crystals to unlock new starting bonuses as well as a few other features, it feels a bit like the game was 95% done when someone said 'We should have a permanent progression system'. It sits on top of the game, instead of really being a part of it.\n\nOverall Opinion:\n\nA solid game. You're not going to look back nostalgically on it in 30 years' time, but it'll give you a good few hours of fun. 82/100", "timestamp_created": 1508802846, "timestamp_updated": 1508802846, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565508", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35920548": {"recommendationid": "35920548", "author": {"steamid": "76561198112821449", "num_games_owned": 13, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 457, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511682718}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun little game to play!", "timestamp_created": 1508678647, "timestamp_updated": 1508678647, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.412371", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35829001": {"recommendationid": "35829001", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070575173", "num_games_owned": 51, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 588, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508630858}, "language": "english", "review": "Hey don't be put off by how much Im writing here you lazy bum it will only take 1-2 minutes, nice and consice XD.\n\n[h1] The GUCCI [/h1]\nI think this game is certainly worth your money as a well made indie game, its been a looong time since I have played a satisfying RPG like this one. You are well rewarded for beating bosses and dungeons and making choices within the game is fair and legitimate (e.g making a logical choice jump over a pit but cucks you amyway by having a plot dagger tell you your going to fall in anyway and kill you SORCERY 2 AMIRITE?!!) not to say there can be uncertainty and risks depending on your choices.\n\n[h1] What's GUCCI [/h1]\nHowever after completing the game replayability becomes an issue. You see, after achieving one of the multiple endings you essentially have to start over the exact same way with only minor differences in procedural generation (map shape and position of waypoints) and potentially a new class to play. This puts me off personally knowing I will be rexploring the same kind of dungeons and enemies and towns just to branch off late game for a different outcome at the end.\n\n[h1] What's not GUCCI [/h1]\nFurthermore there is a problem with the game's balance. The game gets easier the further your progressing which really should be the other way round. I often get a surplus of resources in my inventory like 9 spare high tier healing potions that I never usually need. This will make replayability only more underwhelming understanding the basic concept of the game inside-out due to the lack of varied content.\n\nHowever that is heavily outweighed by the \"true experience you start with\" which is certainly satifying.

The game never really evolved after the start - throughout the whole game, you're fighting essentially the same monsters with different skins. This wouldn't be a problem if the core gameplay was fun, but for the most part the gameplay was average. I enjoyed avoiding enemy projectiles (which essentially amounted to quick-time events where new windows pop up and you have to close them), but besides that it doesn't really feel that different from other RPG's.\n\nMy other problem with the game is its difficulty curve - I beat the game twice, once as a Warrior and another time as the Worthless class, who starts with poor stats and can't hold a shield. Both times, I found that after I reached some threshold around level 8, I pretty much was too strong to die. As long as I didn't fight enemies 3 levels up, it felt like I was able to kill everything by just spamming the basic attack, and I didn't even have to worry about using any of the several potions I've stored in my bag. This problem was only exasperated as you level up, to the point where I just found the endgame tedious, instead of fun. There was absolutely no sense of danger.

For those who do not know, Kingsway is an rogue-lite RPG with the UI of an old windows OS. It's neat. I would like to get this out of the way, I don't get the negative reviews with them expecting more out of the game because of the trailer. All the trailer states is customizable UI and nothing else. I can say the Trailer is a bit vague, but because of the vagueness of it, people projected what the game will be like and overhyped it for themselves. This, of course, disappointed those people. I guess I will start with the pros:\n\nPros:\n\nCool Aesthetic\n\nCombat is fun for the most part (Little windows pop up and the enemies move around the screen and you have to defend and attack at the right moments, use spells/abilities, or choose to escape)\n\nUnlockables that make starting the game again easier\n\nGreat Soundtrack\n\nUnlike some other people, I actually enjoy the different classes.\n\nVaried enemies as the game progress. Some are pretty interesting, like the Phantom (Who can close your UI windows) or Shadow Bandit (Minimizes his battle window so you have to manually click it open)\n\nVery few bugs\n\n\nNeutral:\n\nIt's fun to get a broken combo of legendary items that give skills that your class usually doesn't get and you are able to cheese your way through some bosses. This is could be seen in two areas.\n\nCons:\n\nCan get repetitive, however, it depends on the type of person, since I had fun for all the hours I played. The game lacks a lot of events, so events start to repeat. It takes about 2 or 3 playthroughs to see all the events in the game. Events range from quests, dungeon events, and overworld events that give items or buffs.\n\nSome enemies are purely attack and defend, which works for some and not for others. E.G. The sea serpents and goatmen.\n\nIn some ways the game is a bit too easy, I usually am able to complete an ending on my first or second try with any class. Once you get past level 10, and you aren't stupid, it pretty much guaranteed that the run is going to be successful. The only class I had to repeat 3 times was the beastkin was because a bug stopped me from getting the \"Complete the game as a beastkin\" so that was annoying, ending 5 \"Sacrifice\" is the bugged ending.\n\n\nOverall: I think it is a solid game and worth a buy. For achievement hunters, it's quite good and for someone who looks for a casual rogue-lite experience, it's also great. If I would give this game a number rating, I would give it either a 8/10 or 9/10. \n", "timestamp_created": 1506103557, "timestamp_updated": 1506103557, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35097763": {"recommendationid": "35097763", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983495899", "num_games_owned": 628, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 234, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505607025}, "language": "english", "review": "Fascinating concept for an RPG.\n\nReally reminds me of Paper's Please with how it's based around managing your screen space and efficiently handling tasks.

I'm stuck on windows 10 because of my specs so that's definitely refreshing.\n\n2) Probably not for everyone, but I got attached to the music after a while. The soundtrack is definitely gonna loop a few times during a full playthrough as that's probably gonna be around 3 hours and the playlist is about 30 minutes long or so. not a musical expert (read: a fuckin idiot) so I don't have much to say about it besides \"it's neat.\".\n\n3) The pacing of the game. After a few minutes you'll already get what you're going to do in battles for the rest of the game without it becoming too grating, as the different characters and the pop-up attacks from various enemies keep you on your toes. \nLest you wear the ring of pain, the shadow moves slowly enough for you to grind peacefully on the left-mid side of the map until you're actually ready to move towards the end of the game. Even then, the shadow isn't like in One Way Heroics. It just changes the enemy type from being biome-specific enemies to an ambiguous \"shadow\" that can be fought and still gives XP, but no items.\n\nComplaints:\nIf anything, I feel like the quests are lacking. I've seen the game streamed firsthand and I thought the game was going to be absolutely massive and a playthrough would take ages, but despite the map being randomized every playthrough, the quests you get are generally pretty static. There isn't exactly a ton of enemies either, you'll just encounter the Cultists in the mountains, the Clot in the catacombs, stronger variants of previously fought enemies as you go to the right side of the map (with a few original enemies here and there like the goatmen).\nAlso, a more detailed stats menu showing some of the more auxilary stats (like the magic power boost you get from Warded enchanted items) would be nice.\n\nOverall, trying to get the 5 different endings with a different character each time is how I recommend playing, as you'll probably get the most of your money's worth that way.\n(protip: do your first run with the beastman and invest into iron stomach)", "timestamp_created": 1505901631, "timestamp_updated": 1505901631, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.548872", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35078653": {"recommendationid": "35078653", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009574530", "num_games_owned": 143, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1156, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505150377}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun, charming, addictive, great gameplay loop.

After that, on my next successful playthrough, I always kept the game running so I didn't have to load a save, just in case.\n-The music is meh. On the positive side, this game is perfect for playing while listening to interesting podcasts, so the music isn't needed.\n-Inventory management gets annoying, especially if you get deep into a run.

Beat it on the second try, not going to play again, even though there are other endings to get.\n\nI think what bothered me the most was the combat system. You pick your attack by clicking a button, then a little bar fills, and when it's full you attack. The enemy does the same (minus the button), and of course keeps attacking no matter if you act or not. You have to pick your attack quickly so you don't waste time, and while you are doing that the button actually moves around. I got used to that quickly, so after a while the moving wasn't challenging anymore, just annoying. Also occasionally enemies do special attacks that you can dodge by clicking some other suddenly appearing moving buttons. What it boils down to is that I had to put actual effort into controlling my character. The very opposite of tight controls. Getting your character to do what you want is part of the challenge, and constantly drains your awareness. I like turn based games, and I like action games, but in this weird mix the two components only took away from each other.\n\nOther than that I was mostly annoyed by having to use purely mouse controls for everything (you can actually unlock hotkeys later on, great...). And a bunch of things just felt clunky. For example the inventory. I spent a lot of time dragging little item icons from one window to another, either to loot them or to organize the items. It really does feel like organizing files on an old OS, and you have to do it purely with your mouse. And after every fight you have to click loot, take the loot, then click that you want to continue. It drags on a bit after a while.\n\nThe difficulty curve is as you would expect from a casual game with permadeath. If you survive the early game, there is very little risk of dying if you play a beefy character.

That sounds fun. I guess leading adventurers off to things? I mean it's an Adult Swim Game so I know I'll be expecting a good game. Oh! It's on sale. Might as well grab it now.\"\n\nThis game is not what I was expecting. But it is a amazing RPG roguelike game. Now I normally hate games with time limits. But this game does it so perfectly. You aren't too rushed when you know what you're doing. Although I admit my first playthrough I was like \"AH! Darkness! Move move move! *dead*\" But after you get the swing of things you will enjoy this game if you enjoy rpgs or roguelike games.\n\nSo something I have to point out. It is really hard to get attached to your characters in roguelike games. Most of the time you end up with Rogue Legacy or Dark Souls where you might enjoy a character but you know they are going to get destroyed by something. Now I'm not saying these are both bad games. They are both good games. But with Kingsway, you feel attached to your characters so much. (Especially with the added ability of bringing your own portraits. I'm enjoying ROTK characters roaming or getting rekt by monsters.) Each character you customize the growths and find skill books that can give them skills that might be hard to come by for their classes. Oh yeah their are a total of 8 classes. 3 unlockable ones. And 5 different endings as well. Each really fun and rewarding (except ending 5. Where you just get rekt.)\n\nAnd a huge huge huge bonus. With the funny unique mechanics they do with the old windows computer set up. They still manage to bring you into the world and have you enjoy all the creatures and the different enviroments.  Whether it's cult of demons or a cult of flying darkness monsters. Each have their own dungeons with a varied amount of different creatures. This game has quite a bit of secrets. And I wouldn't recommend looking up any until you go through your first succesful playthrough.\n\nIn conclusion. I recommend this game easily. Although it's different than I was expecting. It certainly wasn't bad. It was amazing. One of the best roguelike rpgs in my opinion. Buy it full price.

After Kingsway, I am proud to say that I was lucky enough to be born during a time when Windows 95 reigned supreme. I don\u2019t remember much other than the ridiculously hideous UI with the solid grey taskbar and borders. Playing made me want to change my desktop theme to match it and when I did, I absolutely hated it. Andrew Morrish, creator of Super Puzzle Platformer, and Adult Swim published Kingsway as a means for us to all remember why we hated early Windows OS (Some of us still hate current OS, thanks Microsoft). This rogue-like takes the player into the a fantasy world, where you are trying to save it from a world-eating monster.\n\nKingsway is the encapsulation of all the best and worst things that the 1990s Windows OS had to offer. In a way the game is simultaneously beautiful and and outright obsolete. The piercing blue screen that you encounter when your character dies reminds me of the blue screen of a stop error when a computer crashes. The ugly grey and blocky borders on the windows is nostalgic with a hint of \u201cOh God, is this what Windows used to look like.\u2019 It truly captures the essence of what 90s Windows OS used to look and feel like. The fluidity of the OS is unbelievable and accurate to the time that it represents.\n\nKingsway a reminiscent game of an era that has passed. The look and the feel of the game only add to the experience. Although the game lacks a story, it is made to push the player to try new things. It may take time, but reaching the end is achievable. The gameplay is where the game really shines. It was fun to manage each window that would appear; I enjoyed each individual challenge that every enemy presented. The point-and-click adventure part of the game was secondary to the fluid combat system. Experimenting with classes lead to different outcomes and it felt like I learned something through each character. The generic upgrade system per character death is something found in many other rogue-likes. The atmosphere and the aesthetics of the game really drive it home for me. If you\u2019re looking for a game that reminds you of the Windows OS glory days, this is the perfect one. The game is easy to pick up and play on the go. The controls limit the game to a mouse and keyboard and the only thing I would want more out of this game, is the ability to play it on the go.\n\nFor a more details, here is the full review on my website: http://www.pushiforinventory.com/afantasyofwindows", "timestamp_created": 1505510541, "timestamp_updated": 1505510541, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34970101": {"recommendationid": "34970101", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987683667", "num_games_owned": 325, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 956, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509746768}, "language": "english", "review": "It plays a niche but it does it perfectly.

This is a good game. A really good game.\n\nPart of the charm is that, like Windows 95, you're basically fighting against the interface as much as you are fighting against your enemies. It'll get cluttered, but that's a good thing. It allows you to easily monitor your stats, equipment, access healing items like potions and keep a log of everything that's happened in a run. Combat is pretty rewarding as well. Since you're fighting against the UI as much as you are enemies, keeping up with the battle and switching between attacking, blocking and healing at regular intervals without dying or losing track of your enemy's attack progress bar in the process feels like a huge accomplishment in of itself. As you gain levels, complete quests (which are given to you via email, by the way; there's even ones that mimic spam emails from 20 years ago!) and boost your stats and reputation as you progress through the game, it truly feels like you're growing from a newbie adventurer into a skilled knight or mage, ready to storm the king's castle.\n\nWhile the UI can be frustrating if you're a first-time player, the familiarity of an operating system also lets you adapt to Kingsway faster than most other games in this genre. It definitely is an interesting choice, but also probably the best, because by your 4th or 5th run you'll be familiar with how the game works, its quirks and how to make your way through the world.\n\nOh, and yes, this game can run on a toaster. A computer from 10 years ago, but if you want a computer from 20 years ago that can run it, look at the real Windows 95. Really, if you're still using a Pentium MMX for some reason, get a new computer. Unless you're a retro computing enthusiast like me, you have no excuse.\n\nOverall, I give it a Yes. If you're looking for a fresh take on the roguelike genre without spending too much and with a ton of charm to it, give Kingsway a go. It is the #1 operating system for daily tasks like skeleton smashing and loot organizing, after all, and unlike Windows, it doesn't cost $200 for a license!", "timestamp_created": 1505372090, "timestamp_updated": 1505379150, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.563758", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34941855": {"recommendationid": "34941855", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034543358", "num_games_owned": 537, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 317, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505416318}, "language": "english", "review": "window and inventory managment sim + LOOT!", "timestamp_created": 1505361056, "timestamp_updated": 1505361056, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34940844": {"recommendationid": "34940844", "author": {"steamid": "76561198168980050", "num_games_owned": 1212, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 62, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511794015}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u539f\u8c05\u6211\u82f1\u8bed\u4e0d\u597d \u6e38\u620f\u975e\u5e38\u597d \u5c31\u662f\u6ca1\u6c49\u5316 \u6587\u5b57\u91cf\u5f88\u5c11\u554a \u5c31\u662f\u4e0d\u66f4\u65b0\u6c49\u5316 \u51fa\u4e2a\u673a\u7ffb\u4e5f\u884c\u554a \u6e38\u4fa03DM\u90fd\u6ca1\u6709\u6c49\u5316\u8865\u4e01\u5fc3\u6001\u70b8\u4e86.......", "timestamp_created": 1505355945, "timestamp_updated": 1505355945, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.603960", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34928459": {"recommendationid": "34928459", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972554966", "num_games_owned": 323, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 665, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505665630}, "language": "english", "review": "A deceivingly smart RPG, Kingsway grabs you by the throat and just doesn't let you go. You want to get to that castle, and you get awfully attached to your characters, even if they are not meant to be durable at all.\n\nThe whole \"RPG OS\" theme is quite bright. The combat system is really interesting and creative. It's difficult to put in words, but there is something charming and fun about receiving emails from your guild with quests or having to open a minimized window to avoid the sneak attack from an assassin.\n\nThere will be a window for your world map, one for your inventory, one for your stats and so on... And then, to beyond your character, monsters will attack you with infection-like pop-up windows and loot will be collected from your enemies folders. The amount of windows opened may also have effect on gameplay: some monsters may open hidden windows behind all of them, with bombs and curses that you have to close before they damage you... But closing all windows is also risky, since some monsters will deal more damage after all windows are closed. In fact, some monsters attack by closing windows you have opened.\n\nThe game could really benefit from a little more variety, but for it's price and considering it's not something you are supposed to play for 100h or more, this is not a huge concern, and certainly not reason to dislike the game.

These windows will move behind your current combat window while also obscuring your stats/inventory windows; and losing track of them can spell your doom! This puts an interesting emphasis on clever window management and actively rewards you for not only having fast reaction time, but also being able to multitask and manage multiple windows at the same time. \n\nOverall the game is extremely fun and engaging, despite following what at first seems to be a typical turn-based system.

Better than Mainlining, you should go check it out, it's only 7 quid (10 bucks).", "timestamp_created": 1505000378, "timestamp_updated": 1505000378, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.540675", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34844088": {"recommendationid": "34844088", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004754899", "num_games_owned": 695, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 540, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504981135}, "language": "english", "review": "I beat the game and watched all the different endings just to be sure I wasn't missing anything.\nThe game was both good and disappointing.\n\nThis is a solid rpg with turn-based-not-turn-based combat and I really liked the mechanics.\nThe main problem I had with the game was that with the setting of the whole game being an operating system, you'd expect them to do more meta stuff with that. While the game messes with you in cool ways, it never really ties the story with the computer OS mechanic.\n\nThey could have easily made the story a lot more interesting if they just had a tiny bit more imagination and were less grounded in their plot, at least towards the end. Huge missed opportunity. Still, it's mechanically a good game, albeit a bit too expensive for its simplistic combat system and lack of really interesting enviroments.\n\nOh, and if you suck, it'll get repetitive really quickly. In order not to suck though, here is a short list of tips:\n-Almost never rest (takes too much time)\n-Go through as many nodes in your path as possible\n-Visit most dungeons\n-Go through all dungeon nodes, if at all possible\n-Remember, XP and stats are key to everything\n\nConclusion:\nBasically, I'd say the game is worth around 7 Eur, if you manage to beat it on your fifth try. If you're really bad at turn-based RPGs or clicking on slowly moving small buttons, don't buy it for over three.\n\nEdit:\nI recommend games only if I think they're worth it at full price.", "timestamp_created": 1504982775, "timestamp_updated": 1505322613, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495144", "comment_count": "7", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34833275": {"recommendationid": "34833275", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044522244", "num_games_owned": 94, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3527, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505110072}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is a beautiful mix between rpg, text based adventures and roguelikes.\n   The enemies are put in appropriate spots, several different endings  and character builds/classes for replayability , Though theres some RNG involved with more skill and knowledge of the game you have the smoother and faster your run will be.  The game is intuitive and Just feels amazing with the theme, I loved the way some enemy attacks would come on screen and act like their real world counterparts...(where arrows shoot lineary across the screen, bombs fly upward and come back down)\n\nThe only major complaint I have is the leaderboard...with a daily seed so many endings, and the perfect setting for speedrunning ...it sadly just boils down to how much XP you earned before game over...who wants to grind more per day. = (\n\n10/10 in my book still and I just  wasnt able to put it down until i unlocked everything in the game...which took me around 30hours.

It's simply an RPG where fighting the interface is part of it's gameplay.  While it's standard to say you have multiple classes, permadeath mechanics, Active-time combat and replayability... this game's uniqueness is the interface and how the gameplay engages.  As the horror genre uses interactive mouse to immerse you into the gameplay. The UI manipulation in this game takes simple menu clicking to a wonderful immersion as well.  I found myself engaged to where time disappeared as I played through the game. \n\nFor the price, I believe this game is worth it for me.  I believe at least 60 minutes of gameplay will confirm this for you or not. I also recommend turning on mouse trails in the options for nostalgia.  \n\n[h1][u]DOES IT ENTERTAIN[/u][/h1]\n[b][i]The viewers responded well and appreciated how mechanics in the game created chaotic moments I had to respond to.[/i][/b]\n\nThis game allows for stop and go pacing. If you aren't actively engaging, the game pauses for you.  Every item in the game can be renamed, including characters, which allows for including your communities into the game.  Alternatively you can name everything buttmunch or other such comical names.  However, the simplicity of the game interface means that the entertainment naturally focuses on you as a broadcaster first and foremost.  This is a especially strong for broadcasters who connect to their communities and hold conversations. \n\n[h1][u]DOES IT STREAM[/u][/h1]\n[b][i]Yes, as it provides varied pacing of activity ranging from \"chat with community\" to \"OMG! CLICK ALL OF THE THINGS!\"[/i][/b]\n\nWhen action is happening there are some unexpected results/twists where you can suddenly find yourself juggling a lot and have natural opportunities to react to the game in very entertaining ways. While a lot of the gameplay elements throughout the game become understanding the underlying systems, it's stream-style feels like Binding of Issac RPG playthroughs where eventually it's about execution and maintaining good conversation with your community.", "timestamp_created": 1503871271, "timestamp_updated": 1503871315, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.664180", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34530348": {"recommendationid": "34530348", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003897548", "num_games_owned": 571, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 759, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501224819}, "language": "english", "review": "Enjoyable, light, procgen RPG wearing the somewhat nostalgic guise of a Windows 3.1-style operating system, with plenty of nods to computing foibles of the era.

your money.\nIt is no exaggeration for me to say that this is one of two games I have ever bothered to get all the achievements in, speaking volumes for my short attention span's interest in this particular game, which held its ground for a solid 25 hours before I finally beat the game with all endings, all classes, saw every monster and beat every boss and decided that I had, at long last, seen everything and would no longer find anything else different.\nThe combat system is new and unique, fresh and fun while proving that fully mastering the art of window management can be unexpectedly difficult.  The soundtrack is one of the best I've heard, probably being the foremost reason I have for staying with the game until the end, as it makes you feel exactly like a harsh journey to save the world ought to.\n\nThere isn't a ton of content as runs are fairly short, but there is enough randomization and quality of the base content itself (I personally feel) to justify the price.  My personal biggest disappointment is the endings -- they are very much as basic as can possibly be and don't really do anything to give you or your character some closure, although the puzzle with the monoliths and arch makes me wonder if perhaps there will be more lore or a new game in the works eventually.\n\nIf you are not into roguelikes or desire games with high amounts of story, then I cannot in good conscience recommend Kingsway.

One major flaw, and possible the only flaw, is the lack of variety... which is a bad thing for a randomly generated game. Looking at the screenshots and videos of this game, you'll see \"nodes\" connecting each line, which I will refer to as \"destinations\". Upon reaching a destination in the overworld, you are given a \"random\" encounter - by which I mean, barely random. A majority of the time you will run into an abandoned house/building that has 1-2 monsters in it and virtually nothing else of actual value. Sometimes you'll run into a band of thieves, usually 3 at a time. Other times you will run into a random adventurer or wanderer, who may or may not be under attack from a monster and if you save them, you get an item. Let's not forget our little demon/goblin friend who carries stuff with him and sells you an item from his collection, but only one item, for 50 gold. That's the general scope of the \"randomness\" of events or encounters in destinations on the overworld. As for maps inside areas, such as a cave, there are no events on any of the nodes. There's just... not enough to this game's encounters/events for it to be worth $10. Perhaps $5, yes, but $10 is just not worth it at this time. Whether or not more encounters/events are planned for the future, I don't know... but I can hope. As a side note, if you do buy this game, then go Rogue.

It is also indeed a rogue-like, where you'll be dying a lot. BUT, if you have issues with rogue-likes (as I sometimes do), this game is WAY less unfair, and every playthrough has a decent chance of completing the game.\n\nThe game's RPG trappings are simplistic but very well done. Explorer-like windows act as your item bags, status, and world map, and your quest looks like Outlook or other old email clients. This aesthetic is cute and doesn't wear out its welcome due to it being very functional and easy to use. The window system plays into the combat as well, as some enemy attacks appear as windows scrolling across the screen that you must click on to avoid, which is easier said than done as other windows may have priority.\n\nSpeaking of combat, this is actually one of the best single-character RPG battle systems I've experienced. Your turn and the enemy turn are represented by an increasing progress bar. Some of your actions are faster than others, and the goal is often to get in as many attacks as you can and then switch on your Block action before the enemy turn comes up. This creates all sorts of strategy, and makes high-speed, agility builds viable, as you can get in many attacks before the enemy turn comes up.\n\nThere are a wide variety of classes too. While you control which stat to increase, meaning you can turn your character into pretty much whatever you want, the abilities you gain and pick from is dependent on your starting class. This gives you a lot of freedom in how you want to build your character, while also making each new class you pick a different experience. You can also find items that each give you cross-class skills (Like, Fireball or Sword Mastery) when you equip them, or skill books that permenantly give you such skills. Each ending to the game unlocks a new class as well.\n\nThe game is a rogue-like, which mean death comes swift and awesome, but as I stated above, it isn't as nasty as other rogue-likes. Once you learn the ins-and-outs of how the game works, a good handle on how to use a given class and know where to go to get signifigant upgrades, victory comes much more commonly than say, FTL, Rogue Legacy or Nuclear Throne and the like. Getting defeated though nets you gems you can spend on more powerful starting gifts for your next characters, and you get the option of taking one item from your dead character to use a gift to the next. Though, I feel there are only a few really useful starting gifts. Lastly, there is a time limit in the form an approaching shadow that covers the land as time passes. But this limit is not as crippling as the similar-acting Rebel Fleet in FTL, as it did not impair most of my playthroughs. Areas covered by the shadow will force you fight an increasingly powerful foe. If your quick and know what you're doing, we can survive and get back out of the shadow, or make your destination before it overcomes you.\n\nLastly, being a rogue-like, the story is sparse and told only in snipits. At first, it's fairly standard fantasy-fair, but it has many moments of surprising nueance. The endings, while short, are occassionally surprising, and even profound, and not at all what I expected. They often repaint your entire perception of the game.\n\nI cannot recommend Kingsway enough. It's addicting fun, and it's both a properly challenging Rogue-like, while also being quite fair in giving you a chance to win once you learn its secrets. Come for the funny, nostalgic Windows 95 shell, stay for the engrossing RPG.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1502213428, "timestamp_updated": 1502213428, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.710573", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34100771": {"recommendationid": "34100771", "author": {"steamid": "76561198333715417", "num_games_owned": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1989, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503158887}, "language": "english", "review": "interesting idea, unique UI\nbut I believe that it could have done a better job.\nwhy not add more plots and elements of map?\n", "timestamp_created": 1502189529, "timestamp_updated": 1502189529, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34097141": {"recommendationid": "34097141", "author": {"steamid": "76561198363558244", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 245, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501848632}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5148\u6709\u8001\u83ca\u540e\u6709\u5929\uff0c\u592a\u9633\u9a91\u58eb\u65e5\u795e\u4ed9\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1502174513, "timestamp_updated": 1502174513, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.619066", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34093856": {"recommendationid": "34093856", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060966581", "num_games_owned": 487, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1771, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501960671}, "language": "english", "review": "I would like to say that I love this game but I don't think it is for everyone.

The game was one of the most enjoyable games I had played in a while and it was an achievement hunt that didn't even feel painful, I actually quiet enjoyed it. \nIt has a decent amount of unlockables, and if you have any interest in roguelike genres and managing an operating system seems like something you would enjoy, then I would recommend getting it.", "timestamp_created": 1502158580, "timestamp_updated": 1502158580, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515055", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34078266": {"recommendationid": "34078266", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047049391", "num_games_owned": 47, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 410, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502098457}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u770b\u4e86\u8001\u83ca\u6765\u73a9\u7684\u3002\n\n\u4f18\u70b9\u662f\u521b\u610f\u548cUI\uff0c\u7f3a\u70b9\u662f\u5185\u5bb9\u8fd8\u662f\u6bd4\u8f83\u7a7a\u6d1e\uff0c\u5730\u56fe\u4e8b\u4ef6\u57fa\u672c\u91cd\u590d\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u6e38\u620f\u53ef\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3\u3002\u53e6\u5916\u5730\u4e0b\u57ce\u5185\u6d88\u8017\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0d\u5982\u5916\u9762\uff0c\n\u6240\u4ee5\u80fd\u6253\u5c3d\u91cf\u6253\u5730\u4e0b\u57ce\u3002\u3002\u4e16\u754c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5e76\u6ca1\u6709\u4ec0\u4e48\u610f\u601d\uff0c\u4e5f\u6ca1\u6709\u4ec0\u4e48\u975e\u505a\u4e0d\u53ef\u7684\uff0c\u5c3d\u91cf\u8d70\u6700\u77ed\u8def\u7ebf\u5c31\u884c\u4e86\u3002\n\n\u672c\u8d28\u4e0a\u6765\u8bf4\u6253\u7684\u8d8a\u5feb\u6e38\u620f\u8d8a\u7b80\u5355\u3002\u804c\u4e1a\u7684\u8bdd\u73a9\u8fc7\u76d7\u8d3c\u6cd5\u5e08\u6218\u58eb\uff0c\u96be\u5ea6\u4ece\u5927\u5230\u5c0f\uff0c\u5dee\u522b\u8fd8\u662f\u633a\u5927\u7684\u3002\u6b7b\u4e86\u4e24\u6b21\u4ee5\u540e\u6218\u58eb\u4e00\u8def\u83bd\u8fc7\u53bb\u8f7b\u677e\u6109\u5feb\u3002\n\n\u5267\u60c5\u6765\u8bf4\u4e00\u5468\u76ee\u6bd4\u8f83\u7b80\u5355\uff0c\u70b9\u71c3\u4e09\u4e2a\u7bdd\u706b\uff0c\u5730\u4e0b\u57ce\u6253\u4e00\u4e2a\u56fd\u738b\u62a4\u536bBOSS\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u4ed6\u4f1a\u628a\u4f60\u4f20\u9001\u5230sky eater\u7684\u5185\u90e8\uff0c\u6253\u6389\u4e00\u4e2a\u5fc3\u810f\u5c31\u884c\u4e86\u3002\n\n\u63a8\u8350\u4e00\u4e2a\u5feb\u901f\u901a\u5173\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6218\u58eb\u540e\u671f\u591a\u70b9\u4f53\u529b\uff0cfury\u8981\u5b66\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u51c6\u5907\u597d\u51e0\u4e2a\u5927\u8840\u74f6\uff0cfury fury fury \u8840\u74f6 fury fury fury \u8840\u74f6\u3002\u3002\u8f7b\u677e\u8fc7\u6700\u7ec8BOSS.\n\n\n\u603b\u4e4b\u8bc4\u4ef7\u7ed97/10\u5427\u3002 \u73a9\u4e00\u4e0b\u8fd8\u884c\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1502099400, "timestamp_updated": 1502099462, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.587285", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34074917": {"recommendationid": "34074917", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044570024", "num_games_owned": 327, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 955, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513147069}, "language": "english", "review": "Super Fun i love this game 10/10 would play again... but i do wish there was a endless mode so i can play until my Character dies", "timestamp_created": 1502082418, "timestamp_updated": 1503859461, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497288", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34073861": {"recommendationid": "34073861", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027865539", "num_games_owned": 559, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1382, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505146440}, "language": "english", "review": "A very unique and entertaining game, great for killing bits of time here and there, but be warned a complete run can last upwards of two hours; however you can easily suspend and pick it up later.

So far I've been an otter wizard and Frog from Chrono Trigger. That's in 10 hours of gameplay, across about 5 runs. A majority of this time was spent as Otto the wizard, who made it to the end on my 3rd run. Compare that to FTL, where I've made the final boss maybe 10 times out of hundreds of runs, and you can see where the game's charm could wear off pretty quickly. It might have a hard mode or something to make the game more challenging, and there are always different classes and characters and builds to try to liven things up, but Kingsway does come off as incredibly easy and front-loaded for the genre. Not necessarily a bad thing, but something to beware of if you're hard-core into rogue-lites.\n\nAdd in a few more map types (even if only cosmetic), and a little more enemy and event variety, and you'd have a game that I could heartily recommend for full price. As it stands, I'd suggest at least giving it consideration, but maybe wait for a sale if you're worried about the game running its course rather quickly.

The chance to STAB WINDOWS.  Yes. Yes, I wanted that.  Many things could do with a good stabbing in my opinion, but Windows more than most.\n\nAnd the OS aspect of the game is indeed it's prime focus.  Harking back to the glory days of Windows 3.1 or 95 (whichever you think it looks like most), the interface is what governs every aspect of the game.  But it is also what creates a huge amount of the challenge.  Everything from inventory management to combat involves about a bazillion windows, and managing the desktop-related chaos is part of what the game is about.\n\nThe most chaotic aspect though is also the bit that is the most unique:  The game's combat.  Monsters appear, random battle style, whenever you are in the process of travelling from one location to another on the map.  More specifically, they appear as popup windows, because who doesnt hate popup windows?  But these arent normal annoying popups: These are popups that roam around the screen.  These enemy windows constantly move like that in various patterns depending on the enemy, which can make clicking the right buttons difficult.  Your basic actions are to attack or block.  Both enemy attacks and your own have seperate progress bars, and watching the enemy bar to know if you have time to attack, or time to use your shield (which is a toggle, actually, and complicates things) is important.  And more complicated to deal with than you might think.  You can also have two activated spells/skills equipped at any one time.  The basics of combat showcase a big part of the challenge of the game: mouse dexterity.  With these windows constantly roaming, clicking the right buttons with the right timing can be hard, particularly when they are moving fast.\n\nAnd this is a theme that will show up in all sorts of ways.  The game isnt content with just the whole attack/block thing.  You've got way more to deal with than just that.  Monster special abilities for instance are unique things.  A skeleton mage for instance might have a fireball attack.  In a normal game, it would simply deal damage to you or miss based on math.  In this game, it takes the form of a big window, moving in a fast arc across the screen, with an \"AVOID\" button on it.  Click the button to not be on fire.  Or it might throw the even more irritating \"wobbly curse\" window at you, or... all sorts of other things.  Basic attacks, even can have funky effects.  There are enemies that, when they hit you, have a chance at randomly minimizing one of the windows that you have open, which is just as obnoxious as it sounds.  Having your inventory window suddenly close itself just when you were about to click that crucial potion is just nasty.  And what's more, multiple enemies can appear at once, creating utter bloody chaos.  Enemies can even summon MORE monsters, or do things like split into smaller foes, or.... you get the picture.  There's alot going on with the combat here.  It's fun and visceral in it's own very unique way, and induces a special sort of panic that few games ever manage to pull off.\n\nThe game is about way more than just combat though.  A big part of the game is about managing your inventory and equipment.  You'll come across all sorts of weapons and items and things, and building your character is just as important and complicated as it is in many roguelikes.  Figuring out which things to equip is not an easy task, nor is choosing what stats or skills to level up.  What's more, you can only hold so many items in any given equipment bag/window, depending on how much different things weigh.  This means for alot of careful decision making, which the game is quite good at.  There is also the travelling and exploring.  You have a big worldmap to wander around, with FTL-style waypoints and routes. When travelling between two waypoints you will get a progress bar (because of course you will), and this is when enemies have the opportunity to pop up, and when traps can be sprung (in dungeons).  The exploration aspect is very well done.  The map is huge and complicated, with all sorts of interesting locations and events.  And unlike FTL, you arent as restricted in your movement.  You dont HAVE to obsessively just move to the right all the freaking time.  Yes, there is a \"timer\" of the same sort that FTL used, in the form of a foul darkness that slowly comes from the left side, covering the map as it goes.  But \"slowly\" is the key word here.  You really do have plenty of time for exploration, and backtracking when you see the need.  But you wont be able to explore everything.  Dungeons though are a different story.  Time passes much, much slower in dungeons than on the world map, so explore to your heart's content.  Or try to, anyway... dungeons are more than a little murderous, filled with traps and extra-horrible monsters, and big nasty bosses that'll be flinging windows of doom at you.\n\nDuring your travels you will also encounter special things that arent just about the map or combat.  You'll find towns and guild buildings, filled with shops and whatnot, you'll find special events and encounters, where you are given an array of choices to make, with different consequences for each.  And you have quests (which take the form of emails, which are often rather goofy) that you can do, which are usually optional, but generally well worth doing if you can pull them off.  There are lots of things to find and do here.\n\nHowever, the game's content is a bit limited.  It's been criticised often for just not having quite enough... though to be honest it seems fine to me.  But I still think it's worth mentioning.  And while the challenge level is high, it's not THAT bloody hard, so it may not take you long to complete it.\n\nThere is stuff to unlock, some of which takes the form of items that you can choose to start with, and other bits that are more Windows-ish, in the form of things like desktop color schemes or mouse cursors, or even hotkeys.  But the list of unlocks is oddly small.  There are also daily runs, but I think a single run is a bit on the long side for this to be truly viable to many players.  It's not the sort of game where I personally would really get into the idea of doing daily runs frequently.  And the biggest issue:  Your screen size. If you are using a monitor that is too small, all those windows are going to get very, very cramped, leading to big problems as you go.  While I havent had this problem myself, I have seen it from others, and it can be a gamebreaker.  \n\nOverall, this is a very challenging and unique game, with a style all it's own, using mechanics that just arent seen anywhere else.  It's not for everyone... the \"accurate clicking\" based combat may be a big turnoff for some players, which is understandable.  But it has the potential for big fun.  Content also seems a bit low to many, but there is plenty of room here for all sorts of additions, whether it be more monsters or items or whatever.  I'm really hoping to see some cool updates come at some point.   Fantastic game with solid, if bizarre, mechanics.  \n\nAnd really, screw Windows.

At times it feels intentionally-obtuse, making you go through annoying micro-managing, or losing gear you literally just bought if you close the window before you put it in your inventory. To me the straw that broke the camel's back was when I found out that you can eventually unlock shortcut keys.

While it doesn't have an in depth story the games combat, character building, and exploration is extremely rewarding the more and more you play. It is quite addicting and character building is completely in the players hands. Classes in this game such as mages and warriors are merely starting templates and the game allows the player to dabble in magic spells and agility weapons even if they chose a warrior. Classes do outline a general idea of what abilities the player can obtain, however a player can easily gain access to various other abilities, both active and passive, through tomes and random encounters. \nDungeon crawling is the bread and butter as it encourages the player to explore crypts and caves in search of items with randomly generated stats and attributes that pays homage to Diablo 2's loot system. Random encounters are always fun and engaging, allowing the player to decide how they approach a stranger in the woods or perhaps a gang of bandits. The game even has treasure demons that function similar to treasure goblins in Diablo 3.\nWhen creating your first couple of characters, expect them to meet untimely demises as understanding the mechanics of the game are somewhat part of the initial challenge and overall enjoyment. Everything in the world is randomly generated, from dungeon locations, inns, towns, random encounters, and quests.\nThe quests in this game are given to the player at random intervals and often times have them completing seemingly random objectives throughout the world. They are extremely rewarding and grants the player a heafty sum of experience points and most of the time you are also rewarded with useful potions or equipment.\nOne of the strongest aspects of the game is that it forces the player to utilize the resources and equipment that they have obtained in an efficient manner that compliments how they build their character. Often times you will be saving items that give you an edge over certain types of enemies for future encounters or dungeon crawling. \nWith that said, this mere 10$ game has my praise. You really can't get much more value out of your money and I would highly reccommend that people at least try the game. A little trail and error reveals all when initially beginning the game and don't hesitate to experiment with different items and character builds.

What sets this apart from other RPGs (besides the proceedurally generated runs) is its charming interface. Drawing selection boxes with the cursor, selecting multiple icons with shift+click, and cursor trails. Simply coolio. The game's mechanics are also able to make a non-frequent RPG player like myself stay clung to the game until I finish a run. The sheer panic of trying to complete quick time events while fighting an enemy or quaffing a potion to avoid an imminent death really spice things up, and even then, things were already interesting to begin with since there'll be item weights to compensate for and skillsets to ponder about. Fortunately, Kingsway is easy to get into (in my opinion), though it'll be hard to master with the several secrets and ending hidden around.\n\nBefore the game came out, realizing that the game and its art would be created by Andrew Morrish, I was excited. Most of it was from playing Super Puzzle Platformer, Morrish's other Adult Swim-published game (and a really awesome one at that, go check it out) and just like Super Puzzle Platformer, both the gameplay and art feel and look nice. Everything's also complimented by the sweet tunes of Landon Podbielski, the composer of Super Puzzle Platformer's soundtrack. The music feels very nostalgic, midi-like, and immersive, I really enjoy it.\n\nYeah, that's about all I have to say about Kingsway. At the price of $10, I think it's worth every penny.\n\n[spoiler]I mean come on, it has a literal blue screen of death, how can you resist?[/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1500749150, "timestamp_updated": 1500830723, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.623983", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33727018": {"recommendationid": "33727018", "author": {"steamid": "76561198134325461", "num_games_owned": 93, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2674, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502266407}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc0dd\uac01\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uac81\ub098 \uc7ac\ubc0c\uac8c \ud50c\ub808\uc774 \ud55c \uac8c\uc784! \n\uc774\uc804 \uc708\ub3c4\uc6b0 \ucc3d\ub4e4\uc744 \uc5f0\uc0c1\uce90 \ud558\ub294 UI\uac00 \ucc38 \uc7ac\ubc0c\uace0 \uadf8\ub355\uc5d0 \uaf64\ub098 \ub2e8\uc21c\ud574\ubcf4\uc774\uae30\ub3c4 \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc804\ud22c\ubd80\ubd84\uc5d0\uc11c \uac11\uc790\uae30 \ud280\uc5b4\ub098\uc624\ub294 \ucc3d\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uaf64\ub098 \uc5ed\ub3d9\uc801\uc778 \uac8c\uc784\uc774 \ub418\ub3c4\ub85d \ub9cc\ub4e4\uc5c8\ub2e4\uace0 \ubcf8\ub2e4. \uc5d4\ub529\ub3c4 \uba87\uac00\uc9c0 \ubd84\uae30\uac00 \uc788\ub294\ub4ef \ud558\ub2c8 \ud30c\uace0\ub4e4\uc5b4\ubcfc\ub9cc\ud55c \uc694\uc18c\ub3c4 \uc595\uac8c\ub098\ub9c8 \uc788\ub2e4.\n\ub450\ubc88\uc9f8 \uce90\ub9ad\ud130 \ub9cc\ub4e4\ub358 \ub3c4\uc911 \uae30\uc874 \uccab\ubc88\uc9f8 \uce90\ub9ad\ud130 \uc774\ub984\uc5d0 \ub2e8\uc21c\ud788 2\uc138\ub780 \uc758\ubbf8\ub85c ooo II(\ub300\ubb38\uc790i) \ub97c \uc5f0\uc18d\uc73c\ub85c \uc9d1\uc5b4\ub123\uc5c8\ub354\ub2c8 \uc660\uc9c0 \ubaa8\ub974\uac8c II\ubd80\ubd84\uc774 \uae68\uc9c0\uba74\uc11c \uadf8 \uce90\ub9ad\ud130\ub9cc \uc2e4\ud589\uc2dc \uc624\ub958\uac00 \ub098\uace0 \uc0ad\uc81c\ud558\ub824\uace0 \ud574\ub3c4 \uc624\ub958\uac00 \ub098\uba74\uc11c \uac8c\uc784\uc774 \uaebc\uc838\ubc84\ub9ac\ub294 \ubc84\uadf8\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4;;; \n\uc601\uc5b4 \uc218\uc900\ub3c4 \uc911\uc694 \uc2a4\ud1a0\ub9ac \ub77c\uc778\uc740 \uc798 \ubab0\ub77c\ub3c4 \uac8c\uc784 \ud50c\ub808\uc774\uc5d0\ub294 \ub300\ucda9 \uac10\uc73c\ub85c \ud50c\ub808\uc774 \ud574\ub3c4 \uc800\uac19\uc740 \uc601\uc54c\ubabb\ub3c4 \uc5d4\ub529\uae4c\uc9c0 \ubcfc \uc815\ub3c4\ub85c \ud50c\ub808\uc774\n\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc0b4\uc9dd\uc0b4\uc9dd \ub2e8\uc5b4 \uac80\uc0c9\ub9cc \ud558\uba74\uc11c \ud574\ub3c4 \ub420 \uc815\ub3c4\ub2c8 \ud55c\uae00\uc774 \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c\uace0 \ub108\ubb34 \uac71\uc815\ud558\uc9c0 \ub9d0\uace0 \uc0ac\ub3c4 \ub41c\ub2e4\uace0 \uc0dd\uac01\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "timestamp_created": 1500748658, "timestamp_updated": 1500748658, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514423", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33726474": {"recommendationid": "33726474", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998522331", "num_games_owned": 359, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 464, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500857920}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is incredible.

So the more you play the game, the more you start to understand how everything works.

Yes, there's a bit of RNG involved in a good run, but the majority of it comes from actually creating a strategy that can work every time. And there's still more secrets and endings for me to get, which I'm finding out on my own due to this game's small community.\n\nProbably my pick for indie GOTY so far.

Highly recommended.\nThe interface is the real winner here though, Getting all your potions and scrolls lined up and ready is strangely satisfying even though you probably wont need either by about half way through since a good build can become almost unstoppable.\n\nPROS\n\n-THE MUSIC. Seriously. I love it.\n\n-Good value for money, plenty of replayability, lots of little things to learn about how to get different endings or to get bonus stats and skills.\n\n-Keeps you on your toes constantly due to the way traps and enemy special attacks work.\n\n-Battles are fun, especially early boss fights which can throw all sorts of things at you.\n\n-Easy enough to make a good build, and encourages making hybrid builds (rogue/healer, warrior/mage etc) if you get some nice skill books. (which you will)\n\nCONS\n\n\n-Will leave you wanting more, IE a fully fleshed out RPG using this interface would be amazing.\n\n-Some odd interactions between skills that you wont learn without testing for yourself, for example from what I have seen Crit chance only seems to apply to default melee attacks not skills (like a spell or any attacks that use mana) and I honestly couldn't tell if Vigilance (first X number of attacks are 40% quicker) applies to anything other than default attacks.\nBut you can easily get more skills points than you need so not really a problem to waste a few trying things out.\nHonestly this is a classic RPG issue anyway and for me is part of the charm of honing a good build.\n\n\nIf this game ever gets Steam Workshop mod support for player created adventures or extra monsters/items and such then it will become a must buy.

(Dwarf, Elves, Orc, Lizardfolk, Draconian, etc...)\n-More quests! (Also items, monsters, etc...)\n-Maybe 1-2 other main story, like when you create a character you can select a story! (Maybe a story with no \"time-limit\" shadow? I like the shadow thing idea, but an alternative would also be a nice touch!)\n-A \"graveyard\" : A menu where you can see all your dead character with stats and the last inventory they had\n-MODS, this would be nice to make our own stories, quests and maps!\n\nI would give the game a 7/10, it's a really nice game and have a lot of potential.

I'll be honest and say that this type of game isn't for everyone but if the game interests you then pick it up and try it, I'm pretty sure that you won't regret it. If you put several hours in the game then you'll soon enjoy it too. Again, the game might be faulty because others might dislike the fact that you start completely over when you die but you'll  receive some of your items back (one to be exact).

I spent the last 4.5 hours streaming it so I feel like I know a bit about it and can for better or worse explain some of how this game is both amazing and utterly frustrating.\n\nPros:\nGood mix of classes. You start out with 5 classes broken up into basic stereotypes: The standard adventurer, the strong warrior, the mage, the rogue, and the beastkin (think barbarian...ish). On my stream I explored 4 of the classes, skipping the standard adventurer... so lets talk in short about my findings:\n\nWarrior: Starts out pretty damn gimpy until you get some gear going. He gets some paladin like abilities with heal over time mixed with some nice attack abilities... nothing really amazing. I got to the first boss with him, so he fit my playstyle fairly well.\nRogue: More or less a damage over time specialist early on. Didn't have much luck due to crappy weapon drops so I couldn't kill much of anything very easily... died pretty early.\nBeastkin: From a skill standpoint very basic character. Had a super helpful early skill in the iron stomach (destroy items to gain health, lots of healing... was wonderful), and after getting geared up managed to actually beat the game. Most skills I used were item based... so really the main one I 'used' was the discard items for hp early on.\nMage: Obviously quite powerful as I was getting able to oneshot stuff fairly quickly, but due to some idiocy on my behalf I died to a priest mob. Focuses alot on magic (obviously) but can be quite impressive.\n\nCons:\nRogue-Lite. It's not so much a con, it just is a statement that the game isn't always terribly balanced.\n\nPlot-wise it's pretty simple, you show up to be the hero, have to beat 3 dudes up to go meet the king, prove your worth, then go save the world.  Average game-length is around 2-3 hours if you manage to beat it, unsure if there are multiple endings up you do unlock aditional stuff via gems you get based on the level of your character.\n\nI plan to stream quite a bit more of it, so I would say it's fun.

The idea of framing a simple, old-school RPG inside of its own Windows 95-like operating system has so much immediate potential that you probably can't wait to dig in and see how the developers played with this conceit.\n\nMaybe there's a fake filesystem to dig through where you can find documents and data files that explain obscure mechanics within the game...

See, I\u2019ve really started to dislike all these roguelites in the last few years since indie devs like to use the genre as an excuse for lazy game design. Why create interesting maps or levels when you can just have the game generate them for you randomly? Why create an interesting story when you can just make the goal of the game to get through it without dying? There\u2019s no good reason for Kingsway to follow the roguelite formula. The Binding of Isaac is a good roguelite because of the massive number of items and unique combinations that you can end up finding, meaning that every playthrough actually [i]will[/i] feel unique. In addition, there are so many items to unlock that you usually feel like you\u2019ve accomplished something when the game ends, whether you actually got to the end or not. Spelunky is extremely fast-paced relative to the games that came after it: rarely will a single playthrough take more than ten minutes until you become pretty good at the game. While enemy and item variety are generally tied to the area you\u2019re in, it still feels like you have to constantly adapt to whatever the game throws at you. Kingsway lacks any of this variability: if something worked once, it\u2019ll probably work again. Every class is static as far as I\u2019m aware, meaning that you always know what skills you\u2019ll have access to at a given level; items, while important, are so abundant that you\u2019ll have no problem finding something that works with your character.\n\nEven when you\u2019re not comparing it to other games, Kingsway is a mess. Your character can only ever equip five skills at a time and I doubt that you would ever want to get rid of the attack button so really you get four. One of these skills is the \u201cescape from battle\u201d ability, so if you want to use more than three different skills in a single battle you\u2019re basically turning it into a fight to the death. This problem could have been alleviated by allowing you to have more than one party member which would not only add some complexity to combat, but would also add some variability to the game since the dev could add taverns or random events where you can recruit new characters. Even then, combat would still be pretty simplistic since every skill is super straightforward. However, Kingsway\u2019s ultimate shortcoming is that it has a good idea and does almost nothing with it. The main selling point of the game is that it mimics an OS, but very rarely is this actually used as a gameplay mechanic. Some enemy attacks will cause pop-ups to appear that require you to click a button to avoid them, and a few hide windows when they act. Everything outside of enemy encounters is just for show. Your quest log is an email application but, for all intents and purposes, is just a quest log. There\u2019s just so much squandered potential here, but now if anyone tries to make a similar game they\u2019ll get flak for copying this one.\n\nIf someone who took a little more pride in their work had made Kingsway, I would imagine that they would have created an interesting story and locations that would really allow them to push the game-as-OS concept to its limits. Instead, what we get is a half-assed version of the first Dragon Quest that looks a bit better. This game should not have been a roguelite, plain and simple. For all the problems that I have with Kingsway, I think that if it had simply been designed as a JRPG from the beginning, many of these issues would never have even come up. Balance testing would have been more thorough with non-randomized progress (as it is, I can spam fire on a boss to kill it before it attacks and avoid random encounters completely by spamming teleport), items could have been made to be more unique than \u201c+3 strength\u201d, dungeons would be designed to be more than a straight line to the finish, and ultimately the dev would have created a game worth remembering. The bottom line is, there\u2019s a reason why most people don\u2019t even bother with the Chalice Dungeons in Bloodborne.\n\nTaster's score: C-\n", "timestamp_created": 1500492918, "timestamp_updated": 1500492918, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 212, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.567185", "comment_count": "21", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33657538": {"recommendationid": "33657538", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024301834", "num_games_owned": 284, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 404, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501351279}, "language": "english", "review": "AWESOME!", "timestamp_created": 1500491439, "timestamp_updated": 1500491439, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.432871", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33657501": {"recommendationid": "33657501", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999475486", "num_games_owned": 313, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1030, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500999863}, "language": "english", "review": "holy shit this game is great!\ni play Zelda BotW, pubg, overwatch  at the moment but don't bother to log in there anymore.\nYou can do so much in Kingsway for this little Price, can't wait to test out other builds\nand class combinations!\ngood job", "timestamp_created": 1500491265, "timestamp_updated": 1500491265, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498480", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33657334": {"recommendationid": "33657334", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050146984", "num_games_owned": 819, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 351, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500582582}, "language": "english", "review": "Dungeon Crawler that uses mouse based click combat stuff (Watch the video to see what I mean)\n\nDeaths cause you to start over, you can buy some stuff to make the new life easier, but it's not a huge impact imo.

So buckle up and prepare for an experience you haven't had since MS Office retired Clippy.\n\nThe game transports you into a strange fantasy world which has you controlling a character through layers of UI windows - each one representing something about your character. Naturally there are UI windows for each bag, and one for your paper doll, but there's also a window to see your health and mana. Out travelling the world? There's a window for that too.\n\nWhen you get involved in combat, a new window opens to show you the monster you're facing and presents a 5 buttion action bar - if you're fighting two at the same time, then the game literally opens multiple stacked windows to show you. Combat expresses itself through obvious progress bars: there's a countdown to when the enemy will hit you, and when you trigger an ability there's a progress bar to when you actually complete the attack or spell.\n\nBut the game really takes a turn for the unique because the parts of the UI that represent hazards are not completely under your control. Combat windows slide around, making it harder to click on buttons to target them with abilities. \n\nTraps and certain monster attacks are handled through what is probably the best rendition of the Quick Time Event idea I've seen to date. If a dart trap goes off or a boulder falls, the game literally opens a new window with a picture on it that flies across your screen with a dodge button. But if you happened to be clicking around your screen at the moment it went off, you might have brought your map to the front, thereby losing your chance to notice and react to the falling rock about to crush you.\n\nThe overall length is short-session permadeath RPG style: a run through the \"main storyline\" will only take 2-3 hours if you live the whole way through. With 4 starting classes and more that unlock upon game completion however, it's not hard to see getting 20-30 hours of gameplay out of this as you master the mechanics of the different classes and try out the different endings.\n\nAll in all, this game is a novel take on the RPG genre with a retro look that I am happy to recommend.", "timestamp_created": 1500489683, "timestamp_updated": 1500489683, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.579146", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33656963": {"recommendationid": "33656963", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071606481", "num_games_owned": 801, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1267, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500727117}, "language": "english", "review": "Solid game mechanics, permadeath, fun rpg/roguelike gameplay.

It's nice that you can put elements where you want but enemy windows pop up where they decide to which often covers your important information. The game also does not save your window positions.\n\nAs for those enemy windows popping up, that is the part of the game I most hate. I realize it's part of the gameplay that the enemy windows move while you are trying to click on them and that things like bombs and arrows pop up as fast moving windows you have to click on while doing everything else to be \"realistic\" but I don't want tests of hand/eye co-ordination requiring precision and speed on the mouse in an rpg. I would prefer the tactical grid combat of a true roguelike in place of this test of my real life dexterity and agility.\n\nThere's too much double-clicking required all the time as you play too. Sometimes you can go right click then select open instead but it's still annoying.\n\nI'm also not a fan of the roguelite progression where you earn gems while playing that you later use to give yourself permanent advantages. I'm especially not happy about one of those advantages being unlocking shortcut keys for various windows in the game. I'm not sure if this will even let you redefine a key once you have unlocked it but I would guess not.\n\nThe bottom line is that what at first appears to be an innovative, deep rpg with procedural elements turns out to gimmicky, shallow, encounter-based rpg which enforces a certain method of user interaction. The gimmick (fake operating system) is only realized enough to suit the game which is an opportunity missed.\n\n(No linux version available)", "timestamp_created": 1500476019, "timestamp_updated":

I got my butt handed to me my first run through at the first beacon. Also the combat like stated elsewhere requires much mouse movement and precision. This can lead to tense and also frustration moments. At the moment 110% worth $10.

I don't usually say that, as you can tell by my review history, but I'm impressed.\n\nThere are several things that make a truly great game stand out from a crowd:\n\n1. Fun factor (Obviously)\n2. Complexity (Mostly RPG's and roguelikes)\n3. Story\n4. Graphics, or as I like to put it, a game's \"Aesthetic\".\n\nThe story in this game didn't really interest me, but all the others above are excellent and out in spades. Right off the bat I could tell this game was going to be special. This game isn't unique in that a few other games have done a similar UI and playstyle, but it's just so... polished!\n\nI can tell a lot of love was put into this game. The complexity is there. Despite only having 4 stats to choose from, each stat affects a myriad of things, you get two stats boosted by force each level, and an additional +3 stat points to stick wherever you want.\n\nThe skill system is equally solid. With one skill or skill upgrade gained each level, you have to choose what you'll focus on carefully! The good news is no class is locked out of anything, so you might start as a Barbarian but get a wicked cool magic item early on and just put the next two levels worth of stat gains into intellect and BOOM! You're a mage, Harry!\n\nI've seen complaints about the content in this game, and I do hope it gets fleshed out. For $10 I will definitely be getting my ten hours out of this and likely a lot more since I'm a completionist, but my advice to the dev would be to continue adding content, maybe new classes, features, etc. This is how roguelikes should be done.\n\nI rate it a 7/10, which might seem kind of bad, but that is quite good for a very first indie release! With more content this will be right up there with the likes of FTL, Terraria, and others on my steam favorites list!\n\nAnd seriously, if you don't think I'm a very critical person, check out my other reviews. I have torn some other games to absolute ribbons. The only fault I can find with this game is \"I wish I had more of it!\" THAT'S A GOOD PROBLEM TO HAVE!\n\nAlso, I hope borderless fullscreen gets added.

I could forgive that, if this game were covered like a AAA production in which you're obligated to show every individual feature in a livestream sometime before release.  I can't forgive it here.\n\nDid the trailers look like they were just early-game, that the game would open up and gain some depth later?  Sorry, no.  You saw glimpses of the mid and late-game there too.  Did you notice?  Probably not, because they're near identical.  \n\nWhat I would've liked to see would've been the in-game \"game plot\", plus a sort of \"meta plot\".  Digging into the bones of the OS, figuring out some stuff about its development, how \"real\" it is, and so forth.  Not only this, but how about simulation of other \"users\", to populate that inbox?  Make it feel like you're on a quest in a world with people and things in it, don't make it feel like you're playing a clicker game.\n\nNot only would it have given some more depth to the story, it would've provided something to the gameplay too.  Screwing with registers to fix the OS up after some odd error?  Attempting \"Necromancy\" via registry screws?  Come on!  The theme of your game should be a feature, not a fancy skin.\n\nI think this game would've benefitted from less weapon types and more variance between those types, less skills and more variance in what those skills are, less enemy attacks/hazards and more variance in how to deal with them.  And so on, and so forth.\n\nAs it stands, there is literally no point to picking a specific weapon type because it is of that weapon type (unless you have a specialty for that type).  Your only motivation to pick some piece of gear is \"which has higher numbers\".  Sometimes you'll be forced to choose between two different kinds of high numbers, the horror.\n\n... Basically, I want something to set runs apart.  You get off the boat, you get your first \"real weapon\", you stick with it until something shinier comes along, you murder everything in your way, you always loot houses, and occasionally you get a (completely random, apparently) quest asking for something you may or may not have any access to.

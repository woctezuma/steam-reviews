Fidel dungeon rescue is a great example of an underated game, it's amazing! Fantastic! And it's shocking that not that many people have heard of it. The first time I played through it, I found the game to be a little too unforgiving, 9 times out of 10 I wouldn't die from a mistake I made, but from moving the wrong way by accident...But thanks to the update, the game is less unforgiving, there's loads of new content, bug fixes, and little things that were polished up, like some of the animations, effects, and even gameplay.

I'd say it's totally worth the price, I thought it was high at first, especially for the game before the update, but now it's a better match for the price. I definitly recommend picking this up if a rogue-like puzzle game sounds fun to you.

It's as good as it promises. Quick play sessions with (at least for me) difficult challenges makes for a satisfying game to play for <30 minutes, or longer when you're doing some other low attention thing (eg reading an article or listening to a podcast eg). When you're afk you can also think about the game and get new ideas for next time (or just keep playing when you want). 

It's quite addictive and very polished (the art, sfx and ui is quite good, and it doesn't glitch or crashes afaik)

With the content updates so far (chirstmas 2017) I feel it's worth the full price tag I payed: 9€ EUR

Challenging, Refreshing, Fast, Fun.
Very neatly designed and well designed.
However, some features really serve no purpose. but they don't detract from it a whole lot.
And, the soundtrack is top-notch.

I give Fidel a 9/10, expect borking.

Like a good puzzle game, just when you think you understand all the rules the game throws a twist.

The game is hard and contemplative, but never slow. The replayability here is really, really high.

This product is exactly what it says it is -- a zero grind puzzler with perfect pacing.

Best of all, this game deeply respects the player's time. Buy it now.

I wanted this to be a relaxing puzzle game but the timer/ghost changes that dynamic. I know many players like a little pressure and say it's not a problem if you get better. For me it's an immediate turn off and I'm not interested in playing long enough to become ghost-proof. I'd rather have an option to just disable the ghost, so no timer and instant death. Making a mistake and then trying to correct it in a handful of seconds is just not fun for me.

Other than that it's actually a cute game that broadens the line puzzle concept nicely. Discovering how the different enemies work and the imperfect levels forcing you to choose are clever additions.

If you ever found yourself structuring your daily routine to maximize "your efficiency" this is the game for you.

This game's main menu can get an IGF award itself. 

"Dog bless this game."

Almost fun. The gripesome ghost chase is well worth a refund, though!!

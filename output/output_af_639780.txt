9/11 IGN , We need more LoliPolice :(

 ==== Cluster F (#reviews = 13) ====

A gloriously flat shoot'em up masterpiece.
Don't forget to place a text file named nude.patch inside the game folder so you can enjoy the game to what it can fully provide.

 ==== Cluster G (#reviews = 10) ====
=> Sentiment analysis: polarity(0.29) ; subjectivity(0.43))
Just like the 1st game, this one is actually still fun. This one sticks close to the original gameplay (hentai touhou) and has a great soundtrack. And this one also has loli's and flat's in it so this is one of the greatest games in my books. And because steam is steam, be sure to add the patch for "extra fun".

10/10 One hand mode is the best way to play this game.

 ==== Cluster H (#reviews = 9) ====

Well done DEVs! This is one solid standalone sequel! Some storyline and different bikes to unlock. If only there's a in-game wiki to explain those pick ups and power up... Anyway, looking forward to the next release; "Deep Space Waifu: B Side Story". I don't like anything too big. I prefer a grab-able and manageable size like my wife's B cup.
Oh, have a look at my go at this game;

 ==== Cluster I (#reviews = 7) ====

*Pockets a bag of marshmellows* No, I'm not being paid for these reviews I swear. >>  No but really, this game's the best one yet of the DSW series. The challenge has been increased much further, with new enemies, harder bosses, environmental dangers (Mines) and more. To counter that, you get access to three different bikes as you progress, each one giving you a different shot type. (Narrow, Spread and Homing)

Unlike the previous game and its DLC where there was no story, this one actually has a plot. It's a silly plot, but you get an introduction to the game and a cutscene after beating each girl. Someone is corrupting the Loli Police from the inside, and it's up to you to save them by... Stripping them naked and following the clues, I guess? Still a better story than Fallout 4.

The difficulty in this game is the highest so far, so I would recommend most of you start on Casual mode or easier, especially for the final boss's level. [spoiler]If you beat it with 5 stars and 100% clothing damage, you get immediately placed in a special bonus level. Have fun! >:D[/spoiler]

 ==== Cluster J (#reviews = 7) ====
=> Sentiment analysis: polarity(0.09) ; subjectivity(0.47))
There's about 2 hours of gameplay if you play on normal/easy. Pretty much a space shooter/bullet hell game where you shoot the clothes off girls. they're supposed to be flat girls, and most are, but some are a bit more ample than that. The art 
on the 14 girls is alright and there's a patch that allows you to see the game uncensored. If you got this game for that.. it's there. The soundtrack is good, though I only really remember hearing a song or two. So I'm not sure if the soundtrack would be worth a purchase. There is a bit of a plot that's both funny and engaging enough to not want to skip through it like other games in the genre. For the price, I think this game is worth it. All in all, this game is what it is and it succeeds in fulfilling expectations. 5.5/10.

 ==== Cluster K (#reviews = 7) ====
=> Sentiment analysis: polarity(0.06) ; subjectivity(0.38))
It's just as much fun as it was before. Same gameplay with brand new music, brand new girls. Except... all of them are... "FLAT, WHY THEY HAVE TO BE FLAT!? COME ON THIS IS NOT MY RELIGION WHERE IS THE O-P-P-A-I"

Oppai is great you know "Coconut" juicy D cups thats the stuff I am talking about, at least you wont be jailed for that! Oh well FAP THAT. I can deal with this inconvenience somehow... Let me just burn my hard disc after beating and giving proper span... I mean justice to all of them lolis.

Peace. Fun story to an already cool gameplay. I expect more revolution in the future though, since that is just a spin-off!

 ==== Cluster L (#reviews = 6) ====

So first off id like to say this is a spoof shooter in the sense it doesnt take its self seriously but as you start if your a completionist then you cant help but get addicted to trying to manage to unclothe the girls for the 100% part, killing enemys and collecting stars for the 5 star rating on each level.  
Dont get me wrong this is no bullet hell shooter its to casual for that but at the same time managing the points above can feel like your in a bullet hell game (not trying to start any arguments this is my personal oppinion).
The music is good and feels to fit the game nicely just like its predecessor Deep Space Waifu and feels to me very refreshing.
the art style again is very good in my personal oppinion and if your a fan of anime style waifu material you could do much worse than the offerings in this game.
back on the gameplay again the controls are responsive with various levels of sensitivity placed on a slider bar for total control and comes with a few modes including killing the enemy without damaging the clothing on the girls along with others that unlock once you have completed a lvl to 100% and 5 star rating (not going to go into ithere though lol youll find out if you play the game.
so far in the brief time i have spent on the game i have found that upon completing the first girl/lvl that the game frezes and does not recover have only tried the first two girls at this point and second girl/lvl turned out fine and gave me a little story to run on but this does not detract from the game as im sure this can be fixed fairly quickly by the dev.

my final words are tis ipicked up both waifu games with soundtracks when they were on offer (think I've paid less than a fiver for the lot) and for the price of the games I can't fault the amount of content, it will provide a few hours of fun when you just want a chill game.

if you like shoot'em ups in anyway and want something not to serious and fun then i do recommend this.

 ==== Cluster M (#reviews = 5) ====

Okay, so the devs notified me, with a reply to my praising comment under the OG Deep Space Waifu, that Flat Justice came out. It was refreshing, and just so nice that they cared enough to reply to a random reviewer, that it caught me off-guard.
I have nothing but praise for this game. The new content is awesome, the waifus are varied, nice to look at, the gameplay is fun, fast and addicting. As of now I have completed the game, but have yet to unlock the one handed achievements, but I will surely do so in the upcoming few days :3.
All in all great developers, probably 2 of my most favourite games ever, and if they decide to make any game at all I will surely be one of the first to buy it. I thank you devs from the bottom of my heart, and I recommend this to anyone who reads this comment! 69/10 :^)

 ==== Cluster N (#reviews = 4) ====
=> Sentiment analysis: polarity(0.19) ; subjectivity(0.54))
First things First I need to make sure you understand 1 simple thing. I played this game for the PLOT, nothing else.

In all honesty this game is near perfect. It's not really a difficult game but it is harder than the original.

The storyline is pretty damn funny and full of innuendos so top marks there.

Gameplay is solid, it's a chilled out Bullet Hell, there are new powerups and even new bikes which change your weapon so top marks there too.

In all seriousness, it's just more Deep Space Waifu. If you liked the other one, you'll like this too. Nuff Said

 ==== Cluster O (#reviews = 4) ====
=> Sentiment analysis: polarity(0.26) ; subjectivity(0.49))
Well, it's sort of a sequel to Deep Space Waifu.
A rather easy kind of bullet hell shooter.
The gameplay is exactly as in the trailer and that is basically what you get.

Lot's of girls, various bosses and it got quite a bit harder than the original.
More wonderful music for dream-like states from Funny Death.
Having listened to some of Funny Death's albums, I'd point out that the game really takes from the top of Funny Deaths best songs. Still worth a visit if you're into that 80ties synthie thing. So definitely consider the soundtrack.

Patch works the same way as in the predecessor.

Oh, what stays the same as in the predecessor is the really fluid well-balanced gameplay.
Controls are tight and feel great, specials give some variation.
There are three ships to unlock now, which offers some balance for difficulty as well.
The story is cheeky as hell - just like it should be.

Short word on the art. It pretty much seems to stay on the same level as Deep Space Waifu HD.
I enjoy it a lot, the expressions got better and are animated more smoothly.
The gallery mode within the game is a great addition too.
If there's anything I could wish for, it would be Mouse only mode with less lives and more points.

It is a great successor, building on great mechanics, adds some and develops the strengths.
A good lesson on how to expand on and develop a successful game.
Definitely a recommendation.
Haven't spent too much time yet, certainly looking forward to more time with it.

 ==== Cluster P (#reviews = 4) ====
=> Sentiment analysis: polarity(0.08) ; subjectivity(0.39))
Pros:
- Same old Shoot 'Em Up game mechanics that we have come to love in the first game.
- There's a bit of a story connecting the Waifus together though its not that great.
- Extremely easy to implement uncensored patch.

Cons:
- Too short, can finish the game in ~2 hrs.

Overall, 7/10. Will shoot off the clothes of anime girls again.

 ==== Cluster Q (#reviews = 3) ====
=> Sentiment analysis: polarity(0.11) ; subjectivity(0.55))
This... this is actually a surprisingly solid casual shmup, playable and enjoyable by pretty much anybody, though complete with higher difficulty levels that, as a nice change, aren't requirements to unlock a single thing. You can play the whole game on "super casual" without ever being told that only hardcore players can progress farther, but those players possessed of harder cores can turn the challenge up.

Of course there's eye candy, censored by default but trivially uncensored, and the engaging "cloth destruction" mechanic that distracts you from the actual dangerous mobs. The girls are generally attractive enough, and cover a broad range of anime tropes. They're lightly voiced and lightly animated, and "completing" a girl adds her picture to the gallery for future... reference.

The sound effects are sparse but sufficient, and the music is actually surprisingly good. Get it out of your head if you can! As for the dialogue, well, it's 100% terrible, but entertainingly so.

Oddly enough, I'm recommending this one. It's not very long, but it's fun, and it's super cheap.

 ==== Cluster R (#reviews = 2) ====
=> Sentiment analysis: polarity(0.15) ; subjectivity(0.55))
And here we are back again, reviewing another game from Neko Climax studios we swore the first time was only a one time purchase, and that it slipped into our basket with a sale by mistake or that we really hated that friend that gifted this to us... Yeah right, lol. They keep making them and we keep buying them, don't we Mr Hentai-San :) ? There is something very nice about these games, uhm standing up ovation... HIde the feminist, prepare the inuendo jokes...let's review DSW Flat justice.

If you are a virgin to the deep space waifu series (see what I did there with the play on the word 'virgin' for an overly sexualised and nudity based game :) ) it is a shoot 'em up in space where you are a king bear (fluffy), riding a space bike (manly), shooting enemies (pew pew), but also shooting off clothes from a bunch of hot beauties below you ('bewbs'), who are distracting you with their talents (aaagh 'bewbs').

Flat justice gives us more new ladies than the original, with a catering to the uhm fans of flat chested breasted individuals, and also adds a story (if you are into anime you should be able to follow it, I didn't try to hard) about penetrating (hmmm) the police and dating every girl to find a mastermind behind some corrupt activity. But again, we do not play this game for the story do we? The game mechanics are top notch, and I think this is where a lot of fun is to be had since this is actually a great mechanical space shoot 'em up. 

The devs really listhened to our suggestions after the first game and they have added a new bike, new super weapons and specials. Hopefully we will get some babes of color with the next one, or a 3 bewb alien girl? Holding thumbs :) You still have the awesome neon menu colors, beautiful "bewbs" (optional nudy patch wink wink nudge nudge), great soundtrack and fun game play. I'm not a big fan of the whole 'cellphone' selection 'Tindery' type menu thing they have going, also when finished with a stage and after taking your photo, it would have been nice if the game just automatically goes to the next stage instead of going back to the selection screen. I think this would have improved the game flow as well. 

Pros - Beautiful babes, harder boss fights than original and enemies that are also more diverse strategy wise (MILF was quite a challenge and uhm I found it hard - that's what she said), good game mechanics, should run smoothly on most devices, wallpapers and photo's you may keep
Cons - Selection of a new stage manually after finishing one hampers game flow, not a fan of the 'Tindery' type menu, no babes of color or hot alien booty, not a game for everyone, once finished not alot of replayability, it will also offend with it's crude humor and nudity (again, if you are THAT guy, just ignore, move on and leave this one to us adults)

It's naughty, it's not PC and thats what makes it great. A worthy follow up to the original, still great, but needed minor tweeks. Thanks devs. 8/10

Even if you don't use the patch to see the DFC, you'll get a great bullet hell with some good music, and at the low cost for the game and soundtrack it's well worth it.

Flat Justice for all!
A fantastic continuation on the Deep Space Waifu series. More shoot 'em up fun, more new Waifus! Plus we get a story as well. 
Great fun, especially for those that like their Waifus with a more slender figure.

 ==== Review 5 in cluster C (#reviews = 22) ====
=> Sentiment analysis: polarity(0.20) ; subjectivity(0.42))
An improvement upon the already good original Deep Space Waifu. 
-Flat chested Lolis
-Added single player story, jam packed with humour
-Galery mode

Great game, greater sequal, greatest plot.
The famous one handed mode did a comeback, and my bible was taken off the shelf from gathering dust.

10/10 Did justice to flat chests.
Can also say "I played it for the plot".

I came for the plot. Came to the plot. Now I need a little rest.

Seriously though it's a pretty fun game even when not looking at the reason why you bought it.

 ==== Review 8 in cluster C (#reviews = 22) ====
=> Sentiment analysis: polarity(0.12) ; subjectivity(0.49))
No shame, still a great cup of coffee.  The production values for such a cheap game continue to amaze me, won't blow your socks off as a shmup but its fun.

If you are anti-fun and anti-boobs then this game is not for you.

If you thought the first Deep Space Waifu was enough to get you put on a list of perverts somewhere, wait until you try the loli-centric sequel. NO. REGRETS. 100% recommend.

I love Funny Death A LOT! Vibes in this game are awesome as well. Besides that I can tell that the developers have put in a whole lot of works on this one. Sadly I'm not into loli tho. I bought this game just for the soundtracks and the developers. keep up the good works :)

Same Gameplay, Same Gurl But Different Costume

Pros :

A fun arcade shooter with anime babes. Deceptively difficult and an interesting/funny storyline. I really loved the soundtrack but it got a little annoying after a while, needs more tracks. :)

So far, Deep Space Waifu: Flat Justice holds up to the original. I love the boss battles at the end of each stage. Yeah... The boss battles... That's what I love...

Deep Space Waifu is the only game that I've liked enough to take the time to 100%. The same is true for FLAT JUSTICE.
A pretty good shmup only enhanced by waifus and the newly added story. TBH I would buy this game again just to give the dev more dollars.

How about adding moving waifus in the next one? You know some moving animated lolis who try to dodge my bullets while I'm trying to rip off their clothes and salivating on my keyboard?

Pretty much the only way to make a near perfect game like Deep Space Waifu better is to add more flat justice.

Easily GOTY.

Flat Justice is better than the first game, with amazing story, better weapons, and lolis. If you have to pick one of the games chose this one.

Following the same "recipe" of the "original" DSW, Flat Justice is a great "Shoot'em Up" with an awesome soundtrack, funny story/dialogues and an extra, cute girls.

Flat waifus are the true waifus. With a harder campaign and an actual storyline, deep space waifu: FLAT JUSTICE is a great shoot ‘em up game to waste your time with.

It's a nice little game, the music blows and I enjoyed both this and the original game.
The silly lewdness is fun. Now I'm waiting for more!
I feel it needs some improvement in the girl's art, but at the same time it has its own unique style.

This game just makes you question what you are doing with your life most of the time, the other times it makes you wonder if what's happening on screen is completely legal.

Would like a disclaimer.

Would like an epileptic warning screen before hand because there is a lot of flashing, good and bad.

Other than that flat truly is justice.

i love this game but its buggy and glitchy like for example i would swipe no one the first girl and its still stuck on the same girl or if you choose another waifu it still takes you to the level with the first girl and i also notice if i quit and go back the screen is stuck. I hope the creators fix this soon

Had plenty of hours on the first installment of the Deep Space Waifu saga.
This is a really great and flashy 2D shooter with great artwork.
The soundtrack in Deep Space Waifu: Flat Justice is amazing.
It's hard to get tired of both the game and the song.

I highly recommend this and I look forward for more games in this growing franchise with fingers crossed.

Just like the 1st game, this one is actually still fun. This one sticks close to the original gameplay (hentai touhou) and has a great soundtrack. And this one also has loli's and flat's in it so this is one of the greatest games in my books. And because steam is steam, be sure to add the patch for "extra fun".

10/10 One hand mode is the best way to play this game.

Fun, challenging and rewarding! Similar to a Japanese import my friend got at a convention over 10 years ago. This game has better animation and main weapon upgrades. In the other game you could have 3 turrets but you always had the same main weapon. Love this game and can't wait for them to fix the first one so I can play that too. ^_^

Even the story is good!.
Alex, I love you please make more games I'll buy every one of them 
(Btw you should probably add emojis, I need more for my collection :> )

Also I have a question, is this game soundtrack copyrighted?.
It's so good it would actually be great in youtube videos so I'm just wondering ^-^

In a world where Flat is literally justice, meet deep space Waifu: Flay justice version. A standalone expansion that does NOT require the standard game. 

Pros: 
Includes a story (first game didnt have any plot)
Visual novel type aspect after completing different girls
Cutscenes

Cons:
a what?

As a direct continuation from DEEP SPACE WAIFU: ACADEMY DLC, It expands on the DSW universes already rich and deep lore, showing King Bear's personal journey of self discovery, justice, and revenge.

With a now corrupt metrololitan police force that hired the aliens to do their dirty work, its up to King Bear to clean up these streets, and continue his quest for the perfect DEEP SPACE WAIFU.

I openly admit that I love Deep Space Waifu AND the spin-off, Flat Justice. Don't let that name fool you, those crafty waifu's have snuck in some 'bouncy' service as well! (Even more service with a special patch in the discussion forums ;) )I have no problem recommending this to all my friends and co-workers. AMAZING soundtrack with smooth controls! Deep Space Waifu is a steal of a deal at it's price. Got a few minutes? Now's the time to snatch that waifu you've always wanted!

I played the first and adored it. Then I played this, expecting it to fall short of its incredible predecessor. I was not, however, dissapointed; this game is a master piece in every respect. I could not recommend this game more. This game is god and the developer, his prophet. If you have a £ or 2 to spare buy the game. Fuck, if you don'y have a £ to spare, buy it.

The story is funny and what I can point out is that the last boss is fine to be what she is, the last enemy; more when you play with the minimum of lives: v

Definitely recommended to have a good time and for its price it is a good purchase, so, go ahead guys

Just like deep Space waifu - except more story ( yeah, an actual story! cutscenes! )
shoot enemies and also break parts off clothing to reveal your true waifu! you don't need to play with a nude mod, but one exists.
One major thing : all the girls are small-chested,so if you like em big lol - play deep space waifu first.
fun shooter - well-made and just fun to play- you don't even need to play for waifus, the gameplay is good enough on it's own.

*Pockets a bag of marshmellows* No, I'm not being paid for these reviews I swear. >>  No but really, this game's the best one yet of the DSW series. The challenge has been increased much further, with new enemies, harder bosses, environmental dangers (Mines) and more. To counter that, you get access to three different bikes as you progress, each one giving you a different shot type. (Narrow, Spread and Homing)

Unlike the previous game and its DLC where there was no story, this one actually has a plot. It's a silly plot, but you get an introduction to the game and a cutscene after beating each girl. Someone is corrupting the Loli Police from the inside, and it's up to you to save them by... Stripping them naked and following the clues, I guess? Still a better story than Fallout 4.

The difficulty in this game is the highest so far, so I would recommend most of you start on Casual mode or easier, especially for the final boss's level. [spoiler]If you beat it with 5 stars and 100% clothing damage, you get immediately placed in a special bonus level. Have fun! >:D[/spoiler]

Coming from a [h1] VERY [/h1] prestigious lad and hentai connoisseur who is proud of owning many hentai related games on steam I have to say this:
Very intense gameplay which pumps up your heart until you're ready to experience barely legal naked females which will induce a sense of euphoria throughout your body giving you a dopamine rush therefore making you continue throughout this [i] journey. [/i] 
Once your brain adjusts to this dopamine rush and gets more used to [b] barely legal [/b] women they go out of their way and shove a [b] mature [/b] lady by the very compelling and unique name "M.I.L.F".
The game also has intersting bosses which resemble the male [strike] penis [/strike] anatomy which serves the role of the [b] cock blocker. [/b]
[b] TLDR: good game; good hentai; good gameplay; good price and family friendly 8/10 [/b]
[u] Psst... go into the game folder then go into the _data folder and make a text file called "nude.patch" and experience hentai in its new-found glory. [/u]

Not as high in quality as before. 

So I won't lie, it's your standard ecchi game, and if you've played Deep Space Waifu, you'll be pretty much used to this already. It has some small new mechanic changes, and some major ramps in difficulty in some regards, which is nice, but that's when the game starts to deviate slightly.

The inclusion of loli content was... Well, a bit gross, but hey, your tastes may vary. 

However, that's where the subjectivity gets a bit different. The art style in this version has taken a significant dive as compared to previous versions, with images in the game being actually blurry as though they were made in the wrong resolution and expanded improperly. I mean, for a game that costs less than two bucks, it's not awful, I just expected a little bit better in the quality department is all. 

Long to short, scale the difficulty better, and fix the artwork, and then we're solid, but until then... meh.

It's a more of the same (look at Deep Space Waifu and the DLC if you don't know what I mean) but with everything improved (or almost).
In my little review of the first game I said that the game is awesome, the soundtrack is awesome and the artworks are awesome too. This kind of things are still awesome, except for the waifus, to me, I preferred the original one (DLC included), just a personal tought, nothing to worry about.

Let's talk about the rest:

Better graphics (it's cleaner and in higher resolution)
Better bosses (this one was already improved) in the DLC "Academy".
Story mode, for the first time (hilarious stuff, I guarantee)
It's harder, and this is good, 'cause the first one is way too easy (not a bad thing for everyone, but to me, now it's better).

That's pretty much everything.

The game is totally worth the couple of euros it costs.
Hoping to see more waifus while listening to some good vaporwave in the near future!

Yeah ok I was gifted this from the developter.
I also insisted he should keep calling it "Flat Justice".

Why?
Because "Criminal Clevage" is the perfect name for a sequel/sister expac and by god I need more comedy in my weird porn-y, actually quite playable arcade shoot'em'ups.

In fact, 'comedy' is the ingredient 'Flat Justice' brings in to the sandwich that Deep Space Waifu is. Back before you had nudity (in a patch) and top notch even if a little laid back arcade shootin' action. Now you get a more developted story mode that it's solely existance is to make you smile or giggle at the sheer ABSURDITY that is shooting giant women for their clothing. 

If anything I said here did not weird you out, then you ought to nab this game. It's quirky, perhaps a bit too much so, but it got heart, solid gameplay and good visuals. It may be a weird, even vulgar porn game but it is a fun, addcitive vulgar porn game with solid gameplay and character design.

So watch out for the Lolipolice and shoot straight into their heart. There is a sassy conspiracy to uncover with your long, thick arm of the law.

Definately a SHMUP game with a very nice musical soundtrack.  This is a stand alone expansion that takes place after the dlc from the first game.  Same rules apply here, Shoot the clothing off to get a 100% or be a gentleman and try to clear a stage without *stripping* them.  Different modes for those who want it easier and multiple loadouts for your ship.  This stand alone seems to be only in japanese atm, but after playing the first game, I figured out where the menus were easy nuff.  prob is, theres are semi *story* scenes in this one, and I cant understand what they are saying, be it legit or Waifu lol.  A fun game nonetheess.  Hopefully they add a patch for multiple languages as they did for the first game ^,..,^

Good game, would recommend just like the first one. Not quite sure which is better, they are both pretty awesome in their own regards...
BUT I have one major complain about this one. It's the boss music...oh boy does it suck. The soundtrack is important in games and I feel especially in this kind of games. The boss soundtrack in the first game was really amazing. It was uplifting and motivating and was a fun, catchy tune. It made the game truely awesome. But the boss soundtrack here is boring and depressing at best, it is slow and sad and very unappealing. It doesn't bring the motivation and the action that you want to hear in a bossfight. Very poor choice. The other music is still nice tho. Personally I think I like the other game better, because the boss fights feel way more amazing. It's all in the music.

A surprisingly polished casual shooter.   Allows for the selection of two to eight ships with game-play speed differentials on a per play basis pending the desired difficulty.    Nice soundtrack enhances the play-through.   For the price the game comes with enough stages to satisfy.  

The idea for those that just woke up under a rock is to shoot and disintegrate designated areas of clothing from anime females ultimately rendering the subjects in their birthday suits.  A patching method is available for those who want anatomical correctness.  A gallery is provided for after hours entertainment.  The game features a "gentleman's mode" where the idea is to impress by not shooting any part of their clothes as well a "one handed mode" which I will leave to imagination of the reader.

A shout out to a friend who gifted this to me (I wouldn't of made the purchase just based on the premise (..cough..).

There's about 2 hours of gameplay if you play on normal/easy. Pretty much a space shooter/bullet hell game where you shoot the clothes off girls. they're supposed to be flat girls, and most are, but some are a bit more ample than that. The art 
on the 14 girls is alright and there's a patch that allows you to see the game uncensored. If you got this game for that.. it's there. The soundtrack is good, though I only really remember hearing a song or two. So I'm not sure if the soundtrack would be worth a purchase. There is a bit of a plot that's both funny and engaging enough to not want to skip through it like other games in the genre. For the price, I think this game is worth it. All in all, this game is what it is and it succeeds in fulfilling expectations. 5.5/10.

Come for the Shoot em Up, stay for the ladies. 

In all honesty, this game is really good and a steal at its price. With the addition of new bikes with different firing patterns, it takes a step above its predecessor. While I'm not the biggest fan of the new art over the original game, that is a minor issue when the game is well done.

I would recommend this game to anyone of age that doesn't mind seeing a bit of drawn nudity.

The only change I would personally make is the number of levels. I would like to see more, but again, for the price you pay, you get exactly what you pay for. Perhaps a DLC is in the works as they did for the original, and you can be sure I'll buy that one too.

I bought the first DSW for the girls but the music made me stay and the challenge of the gameplay kept me entertained. When I saw DSW: FJV come on the store (pun not intended), I never pressed the buy button so fast. I am was not disappointed. The small gameplay improvements are much appreciated, the music is excellent again, and that triangle of girls-game-music is stronger than ever. 

Dev, if you can read this, please keep up the good work and please let me know if there's a way for me to support you in making new installments. Hell, I'll pay thrice the amount you're asking for both DSW games.

[b][i]deep space waifu[/i] continues to be one of the absolute best adult-themed indie games out there.[/b] I kid you not, the story is better than many story-driven games.

It's just as much fun as it was before. Same gameplay with brand new music, brand new girls. Except... all of them are... "FLAT, WHY THEY HAVE TO BE FLAT!? COME ON THIS IS NOT MY RELIGION WHERE IS THE O-P-P-A-I"

Oppai is great you know "Coconut" juicy D cups thats the stuff I am talking about, at least you wont be jailed for that! Oh well FAP THAT. I can deal with this inconvenience somehow... Let me just burn my hard disc after beating and giving proper span... I mean justice to all of them lolis.

Peace. Fun story to an already cool gameplay. I expect more revolution in the future though, since that is just a spin-off!

It's more Deep Space Waifu, only Flatter.
If you've played the first one and its DLC, you know what you are getting into here.
One or two poses may seem familiar to you, if you have, but for the most part theres mostly new unique poses for the girls.
New to this version is a new special weapon, a new powerup in the form of a close range laser sword thing, and a choice of 3 bikes (that require unlocking), starting with the standard bike from the previous releases, a spreadshot bike and a bike with slightly homing bullets (sadly not a toothpaste laser).

More great music from Funny Death in this version.

Basically if you liked the last DSW game, and you like FLAT, there is no reason to not pick this one up too.

Flat is Justice.

Great standalone expansion to an already great game imo

And as I did for the first one I'll wait for more content / DLC, the current content is completely worth it but I'd gladly support more content

The main 2 differences that I know would be different compared to the first is 3 different ship attack patterns; straight, spread, and curve (sorta lock on) while the first game only had one

A second difference would be that there's a new ultimate (special) ability that shoots a giant laser from your ship, doing tons of damage to whatever's infront of it

Music is great, artstyle is great, gameplay (played with a controller) is also great. I personally think maybe a few more songs could be added but overall a nice title.

Even got all of the achievements so gg

Are you somebody who played and enjoyed the first game and it's dlc? 

Your Christmas has come early.

Are you a sweaty closeted degenerate who's "just into flat chested girls but totally not into lolicon?" 

Your Christmas isn't the only thing that has come early.

Are you one of my Steam friends who has complained in the past about my reccomending the first game having fucked up your queue and caused weebshit to be in your reccomended? 

Your Christmas is cancelled.

The game is good, it's basically the same thing as the first one with a little more content and gameplay diversity and a top notch soundtrack. These devs are cool guys.

So I just got done with this game in less than two hours and I got to say that it is fun.

Another great installment to deep space waifu that has an actual plot 0_0. Yeah I know right?!

Just like in deep space waifu, your objective is to shoot parts of the girls' clothes and defeat enemies and bosses.
The last boss, M.I.L.F, was a pain to deal with, but I eventually was able to beat it. However I still got some achievements to do, so I'll be busy doing those.

The music in levels is great and does not seem out of place.

With a new gallery mode, new powerups, and being difficult than the last one, this is a great game for mature audiences(obviously)

This game may not be for people that like girls that aren't flat, but I feel like they will enjoy it anyway.

A spinoff from the original DEEP SPACE WAIFU.

deep space waifu: FLAT JUSTICE brings the best from the previous game but adding some new neat features.

[h1][b][*]New Pickups
[*]New Characters
[*]New Stage mechanics
[*]New Enemies
[*]Gallery mode
[*]An actual Story mode
[*]H A R D E R[/b][/h1]

Compared to the first one it is noticed that the devs were constantly working on to make it better and polished, players asked and they delivered it again.

As usual, don't forget to place a text file named nude.patch inside the game folder so you can enjoy the game to what it can fully provide.

Have fun.

While an independent release, Flat Justice describes itself more as a "stand-alone expansion" and that's rather accurate. For the most part, it's basically the same as the original Deep Space Waifu and pretty much everything I wrote about it also applies to this release. There are a couple of differences, however (aside from a focus on flat chests and small breasts).

The original DSW was basically completely plot-less. Flat Justice, however, does have a story, complete with cutscenes. Of course, since it's still DSW, it's not serious at all and totally silly. Not to mention laden with some of the most unsubtle innuendos I've ever seen. But it sure adds something amusing to the game and I'd like to see more of that in future releases.

While the gameplay is mostly the same, just enhanced by a some new enemy types and weapons, a few levels shake things up a bit. For instance, one has you avoiding searchlights, failure to do so spawns new strong enemies. Another is a boss rush, that has to be done after 100% another level, and, when beaten, unlocks a new girl.

There are also two additional bikes to unlock, each with their own shot type. Particular the wide one is pretty handy.

The art, while not perfect, is significantly better than in the original DSW, with nearly all the waifus looking pretty good. Only one or two are rather meh.

Uncensoring the game is done in the same way as the first one, just put an empty "nude.patch" file in the "Deep Space Waifu Flat Justice_Data" folder.

Overall, it's mostly the same but more, but improved artwork several small additions make it arguably even better. If you liked Deep Space Waifu and want more, Flat Justice is certainly worth a purchase.

Also, it's probably the only game in existence where you can get called a "motherfucker" by JFK.

The cosmos cried out for a hero, they cried out for help, they cried out for more nudes!

DSW: Flat Justice hasn't really changed too much from it's predecessor, they took the advice "If it ain't broke, don't fix it." to heart and gave us a stand-alone game but this time, le gasp!, theres an actual plot! Story to back up the smut! 

As our hero, Bear King, you must uncover an evil criminal conspiracy deep in the heart of the Metropolitan Police (insert current London City policing crisis joke here) through the tried and true method of modern policing in the year 2069 (Quois?). 

Yes, thats fighting the alien invaders while simultaneously blasting the bejesus out of the clothing of the giant women in the background, be they fellow cops or civillians. However unlike the last two episodes of DSW this time the attention is on those ladies less blessed with chest, a somewhat welcome change of pace from the typical butsy lasses in these sorts of games, and a definite angle on questionably skimpy police uniforms.

As stated before theres really not too much different from the previous game (Which I reviewed here: https://steamcommunity.com/id/Sephirothwolf/recommended/639790/ so go there for a more detailed discussion) though the new unlockable bike menu is a nice addition and the difficulty has raised sightly but not much. In short if you just fancy an SBG that caters to those with a taste for less-endowed ladies then you'll probably enjoy this more but other than that it's worth the £1.69 I paid for it. The story is basically useless fiimflam but it does add a bit more charm to the proceedings, just don't expect Shakespeare. All-in-all a welcome addition. Also, like it's predecessor, the sound track is worth a purchase too, especially if you own none of the DSW series and buy the bundle.

7/10, Recommended.

Just like the original, it's a top down shooter game where you not only shoot enemies but strip the girls naked in the process. What is there not to love?

It has the same strange resolution issue as the original game, where unless I take my desktop resolution up to some insane number, the game doesn't go into full screen mode correctly. I have no idea if this is something wrong with the game or something wrong with my drivers/software. Either way, if you encounter this issue, just take your desktop resolution up to something higher and try relaunching the game.

I've run into some oddities (which may be fixed by the time you read this, so take this with a grain of salt), like menus overlapping or the game suddenly just becoming a background with some music, forcing me to ALT-F4 it but eh. Minor annoyances at best.

Certainly nothing that will really bother or stop me from recommending this game.

It is also very simple. like the original, keep this in mind. So it isn't especially balanced or fair at points. You have enough lives that a few unfair deaths won't really stop you. Bullets all drift toward or home toward you, which can box you in and leave you no way out sometimes and they're hard to see through all the firepower your guy is putting out, which may cause you to have a few WTF deaths here and there.

This game IS NOT to be taken seriously, it's casual fun and amusement and probably worth 3-4 hours or so, assuming you never came back after unlocking everything.

But the developer(s) of this are pretty committed their product.
The last DSW, they put out a buncha new content, and DLC for it in very short order.
(The DLC was like $0.99 so ..)

So that'll likely happen again here, giving you more to do for the whole $2 the dev(s) ask for it.

Do it, it's funny, perverted and a guilty pleasure.

Oh and the music is really relaxing and good if you dig the style.

So first off id like to say this is a spoof shooter in the sense it doesnt take its self seriously but as you start if your a completionist then you cant help but get addicted to trying to manage to unclothe the girls for the 100% part, killing enemys and collecting stars for the 5 star rating on each level.  
Dont get me wrong this is no bullet hell shooter its to casual for that but at the same time managing the points above can feel like your in a bullet hell game (not trying to start any arguments this is my personal oppinion).
The music is good and feels to fit the game nicely just like its predecessor Deep Space Waifu and feels to me very refreshing.
the art style again is very good in my personal oppinion and if your a fan of anime style waifu material you could do much worse than the offerings in this game.
back on the gameplay again the controls are responsive with various levels of sensitivity placed on a slider bar for total control and comes with a few modes including killing the enemy without damaging the clothing on the girls along with others that unlock once you have completed a lvl to 100% and 5 star rating (not going to go into ithere though lol youll find out if you play the game.
so far in the brief time i have spent on the game i have found that upon completing the first girl/lvl that the game frezes and does not recover have only tried the first two girls at this point and second girl/lvl turned out fine and gave me a little story to run on but this does not detract from the game as im sure this can be fixed fairly quickly by the dev.

my final words are tis ipicked up both waifu games with soundtracks when they were on offer (think I've paid less than a fiver for the lot) and for the price of the games I can't fault the amount of content, it will provide a few hours of fun when you just want a chill game.

if you like shoot'em ups in anyway and want something not to serious and fun then i do recommend this.

Deep Space Waifu: FLAT JUSTICE Review

( I don't usually do reviews, but for this game I shall)

If your wondering if this game has the option of an AO game, it can be. you just need to add the "patch" its easy to add just google search for Deep space waifu nude patch and you can do it. 

The theme is about a bear who works for the "police force" that wants to bring peace and equality to the galaxy by having flat chested girls and bouncy girls loved equaly and what not. The bear goes deep into a corrupted organization and is in search to find out who is behind it and what not. I dont want to spoil the ending so we will leave it at a maybe future expansion to this game. over all its a 10/10 game for the price, anime loli lover, and all over theme style. lots of nose bleeds for sure. you can expect to  get anywhere from 1hr to 2hr of game play. depending on how good you are and how much of the game you want to compleate. you can maybe complete the game at around 45min or so, but for a 100% completion you're looking at about 1.5hrs maybe. I would recommend this game to many people to try it and have fun with it. if not for the anime just do it for the game play its an awesome bullet storm shooting game.

Pros:

-great sound track
-great animation desing
-great level design
-saves all your pic's after completing a level
-ability to turn into an AO game at any point you want
-cute anime/lolis
-customizable play style

Cons:

-story/plot is kinda weak (if you care about it that is)
-if you skip the intro at the start of a level you could enter a stage where you keep shooting non stop
-game can sometimes freez at the end of a stage/level and might have to restart the game

Opinions/Suggestion:

- add more levels and charecters (idc if you guys raise the price il pay)
-more sound tracks for diffrent levels
-more diffrent poses for the girls ^_~
-add more diversity of anime girls and other genre anime theme
-better scaling in difficulty as levels/stages increase
-upgrades should be able to carry over to the next stage
-add short movie/scene clips
-add anime voice actors for a more in dept charecter feel

Overall:
10/10 game, GET IT NOW!

[b][i]Deep Space Waifu[/i] was a great game with a silly premise: use a spaceship to strip pretty girls down so you can snap a picture of them.  But, believe it or not, I have had a few friends say that they dislike that game (and anime in general) because most of the girls in games and anime have an unrealistic breast size.  Until now.

[i]Deep Space Waifu: Flat Justice[/i] is not only the sequel we never knew we wanted, but it's fanservice is geared toward the fans of the more less endowed ladies with the largest chest in this game falling into the modestly sized C Cup range.

Do you remeber the great gameplay that you loved and enjoyed from the orginal [i]Deep Space Waifu[/i]?  Still there, along with a few different power ups to enable you to truly mix things up.  The art is as good as the first game, the controls are solid, the music is great, and the challenge is not only there, but turned up a notch because there's a wider variety of bosses to fight in this installment than the previous one.  And of course, the return of the one handed mode for those wanting to turn [i]DSW[/i] into a 'twin stick shooter'.

What's more, there is now a story behind this game, albeit a ridiculous one:  you are tasked with finding a legendary hidden waifu the public desperately wants.  However, there is a secret organization that is not only hiding her, but  thanks to rampant corruption within a police department the investigation has ground to a halt.  So in order to locate this waifu you need to uncover this corruption by dating every woman on the police force. There is lots of sexually oriented tounge-in-cheek humour to get at least a chuckle or two out of players before they go back to dodging everything but the kictchen sink.

So, if you loved the first [i]Deep Space Waifu[/i], go on ahead and grab this sequel.  I mean, it's base cost is only $2 so you have no reason to NOT get it.[/b]

A very nice addition to the base game, in general. In opposition to some reviews I've read, I found the game quite easier than the first.
Pros: couple more power-ups/different bikes with bullet effects; a little story to tie-in the levels; more girls (duh); overall quality is the same from the base game; developers are constantly fixing, improving and adding content.
Cons: I've found some bugs when playing the game, but they are very likely to be fixed; the art has some anatomy/lightning issues that bothered me. I hope the drawing is improved as well, as they did in the first game, but my hope is that they improve the overall quality of the art in the next installments without needing to patch it later (I wouldn't mind paying more for better artwork).

b'Honestly, this actually is a pretty good shooter for $2. It doesn\'t change much from the original DSW but it really doesn\'t need to. It\'s more of what makes it good, combined with some humor and all-around fun. \n\nIf you can put up with the sex-related jokes (the robot boss being named M.I.L.F.), the year 2069, the bear\'s name being Bear F. King, etc.) it actually is a fun bullet hell shooter. \n\nThe truth is, you\'re here to undress the girls. I get that. Unfortunately, Steam makes it that you can\'t feature actual nudity, but let\'s look at this: \n\nStep 1: Go into your file: (whatever directory you used)\\steamapps\\common\\Deep Space Waifu Flat Justice\\Deep Space Waifu Flat Justice_Data \n\nStep 2: create a new text file and name it "nude.patch"\n\nStep 3: Restart the game. \n\nStep 4: (   )'

Okay, so the devs notified me, with a reply to my praising comment under the OG Deep Space Waifu, that Flat Justice came out. It was refreshing, and just so nice that they cared enough to reply to a random reviewer, that it caught me off-guard.
I have nothing but praise for this game. The new content is awesome, the waifus are varied, nice to look at, the gameplay is fun, fast and addicting. As of now I have completed the game, but have yet to unlock the one handed achievements, but I will surely do so in the upcoming few days :3.
All in all great developers, probably 2 of my most favourite games ever, and if they decide to make any game at all I will surely be one of the first to buy it. I thank you devs from the bottom of my heart, and I recommend this to anyone who reads this comment! 69/10 :^)

b"Deep Space Waifu: FLAT JUSTICE is set after the events of Deep Space Waifu and is following King Bear on his search for justice and the 'PERFECT LOLI WAIFU'.\n\n\nGameplay wise this game follows the same format as the previous game but adds some more interesting concepts to it e.g. the ability to choose which bike you ride on which changes your fire type and with it more weapons\n\nThe soundtrack is my favourite part of the Deep Space Waifu series as with every game it has managed to blow me away with how nice it sounds and how well it fits in with the gameplay. It is clear from listening to it that the developers have put a lot of thought into the soundtrack and how it would contrast with the gameplay.\n\nOveral I would say that this game is a good purchase if you're interested in this genre as it has a fair challenge and the reward is pretty good (   )\n\n10/10 game"

deep space waifu: FLAT JUSTICE improves many aspects of the the first game. With more varied enemies and bosses, a story that got a chuckle out of me, and more power ups and bikes. Unfortanetly the games suffers from a few bugs and glitches. These include, lag, music cutting out on a boss, projectiles from me and the enemies disapearing, and a glitch that forced me to redo the m.i.l.f. boss fight because i couldn't click the ok button after the cutscene where you talk to the president. I retried and had to alt-tab to get to my cursor. Other than the last one, these bugs where relativly minor and didn't happen often, the game was just as enjoyable as the last one and i'm sure the things i mentioned can be patched with ease. 


P.S. the music is fucking awesome.

Like the original Deep Space Waifu, this is a short, simple shoot 'em up. That isn't a bad thing, because the games and their DLC are sold for dirt cheap, constantly updated with free content and support, and the games are stylish as hell. I honestly have very little interest in playing a game to see anime tiddies, but I play these games because I love their style so much. The soundtracks are amazing and the visuals are sleek and interesting. You might come for the nudity, but you'll stay for the style. For the price these games and their add-ons are sold for, you really won't be disappointed with what you get.

First things First I need to make sure you understand 1 simple thing. I played this game for the PLOT, nothing else.

In all honesty this game is near perfect. It's not really a difficult game but it is harder than the original.

The storyline is pretty damn funny and full of innuendos so top marks there.

Gameplay is solid, it's a chilled out Bullet Hell, there are new powerups and even new bikes which change your weapon so top marks there too.

In all seriousness, it's just more Deep Space Waifu. If you liked the other one, you'll like this too. Nuff Said

Great soundtrack, improved visuals from the first game, new character bullet patterns and specials, plus a myriad of new stage-specific mechanics to keep things spicy...
AND LOLI?!?

Play on the highest (non-gentleman) setting for maximum enjoyment.

The only way I could see this game improving is with the addition of more girls (obviously), some more complex bullet patterns, and some extra enemy variety throughout the stages, and maybe even make the later stages even harder.
Highly recommended, assuming the material is stuff which interests you.

Loving the game so far, big improvement from the first one. High five to the devs for making another one in the first place. (Lowkey trying to get them to notice me ;w;) Kinda annoying though with some people calling it "child porn". But I find the game funny and enjoyable. I'd buy the sound track and others to support them but I don't have a ton of money right now so I have to stick with the games for now. Best of luck to the devs and anyone else who plays, just watch out for too much intimacy. Keep up the great work, can't wait for the next game!

DSW: Flat Justice is a standalone expansion of [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/639790/DEEP_SPACE_WAIFU/]Deep Space Waifu[/url] which is a fine shmup in its own right.  Yes, it's still about blowing up clothes off of giant space waifu's, but it's nicely produced and it's fun.

They both share a unique chill quality: the Hotline-Miami-like neonscape, challenging yet not too challenging gameplay, soothing synthpop by [url=https://funnydeath.bandcamp.com/]Funny Death[/url], and of course the 2D waifu's drawn with a touch of folk art - they all make for a nostalgic throwback to the halcyon days when videogames offered simple playful entertainment, when people were not so easily offended.

DSW:FJ builds on that foundation, then wrap it up with a delightfully campy story mode inspired by a meme "flat is justice."  It's also slightly content-richer than the base game; with many imaginative multi-stage boss fights, unlockable vehicles and much-requested gallery mode, it's probably the most complete package Neko Climax Studios have put together to date.  The gameplay has become notably tougher, but there are custom difficulty levels all the way down to Super Casual, so that shouldn't be a concern.

Also, the devs are awesome guys, diligently tweaking, improving and expanding the base game since its launch through healthy community feedback loop.  I'm confident the same will go for this spinoff as well.

I heartily recommend DSW:FJ to anyone looking for a casual old-school shmup who is open to/appreciates playful softcore lewd, flat-fetish or not.  And the base game DSW as well, for that matter (there's a [url=http://store.steampowered.com/bundle/5644/DEEP_SPACE_WAIFU_COLLECTION/]franchise bundle[/url] for your pleasure.)

A standalone expansion for Deep Space Waifu, Deep Space Waifu: Flat Justice is twelve additional stages, complete with several new bosses which continue the trend from Academy of being significantly harder and more interesting than the ones in the base game. In addition, it continues having surprisingly good audio design and mostly consistent visual design - though I felt some of the girls who make up the backgrounds were poorly-drawn this time around, most notably Pucky - as well as adding new features by having new versions of your main weapon unlocked as you go through the game, giving you spread shots and somewhat strange piercing shots to choose from in addition to your standard focused shot.

As I said about the original game, it comes through with its premise, even though the premise is incredibly silly, and my gripe about the stages feeling samey is significantly alleviated by the better boss design in this expansion. It's an incredibly short game, at under 2 hours, but given that it's a $2 fanservice game, this is probably to be expected.

As with the original, I'm going to give Flat Justice a thumbs-up, and recommend it over the original because it does everything even better. My few caveats - that it's not worth going out of your way for, that it feels incredibly sleazy, and doesn't really work as porn - still apply, but it's still a competently made, if very easy, shooter for $2, complete with naked anime girls. If that sounds like what you want, it's not going to let you down.

EDIT: They patched in a 13th girl as a postgame bonus. I'm pretty sure her boss is reused from one of the previous level sets, but it was a free bonus so I'm not really going to complain.

A rather easy kind of bullet hell shooter.
The gameplay is exactly as in the trailer and that is basically what you get.

Lot's of girls, various bosses and it got quite a bit harder than the original.
More wonderful music for dream-like states from Funny Death.
Having listened to some of Funny Death's albums, I'd point out that the game really takes from the top of Funny Deaths best songs. Still worth a visit if you're into that 80ties synthie thing. So definitely consider the soundtrack.

Patch works the same way as in the predecessor.

Oh, what stays the same as in the predecessor is the really fluid well-balanced gameplay.
Controls are tight and feel great, specials give some variation.
There are three ships to unlock now, which offers some balance for difficulty as well.
The story is cheeky as hell - just like it should be.

Short word on the art. It pretty much seems to stay on the same level as Deep Space Waifu HD.
I enjoy it a lot, the expressions got better and are animated more smoothly.
The gallery mode within the game is a great addition too.
If there's anything I could wish for, it would be Mouse only mode with less lives and more points.

It is a great successor, building on great mechanics, adds some and develops the strengths.
A good lesson on how to expand on and develop a successful game.
Definitely a recommendation.
Haven't spent too much time yet, certainly looking forward to more time with it.

Its a casual bullet hell type game that has a pretty good soundtrack. Includes lewd anime characters of the flat type and one handed mode which should be included in every game.


Also jail is fun you get free food and housing. but you have to work in jail and they pay you like a couple cents an hour. at least my butt's clean now.

Pros:
- Same old Shoot 'Em Up game mechanics that we have come to love in the first game.
- There's a bit of a story connecting the Waifus together though its not that great.
- Extremely easy to implement uncensored patch.

Cons:
- Too short, can finish the game in ~2 hrs.

Overall, 7/10. Will shoot off the clothes of anime girls again.

Is the soundtrack still amazing? -yes it is
Is it still a super casual SmUP unless you put on gentleman mode? -yes it is
Is it still hella aesthetic and fun? -ofc is it

Thank you Neko Climax not only did you make more of what was already enjoyable you also ironed out a few of the nitpicks I had with the original and made this one truly unique.

Is this my top recommendation of 2017? 
Yes it is

This game has the same concept as the first game, obviously. This is a work of art, beautiful. I completed this game, start-finish in 68 minutes (including menu time). Very fun, very rewarding. 

Still wanting standalone picture files :)

[I][B]Deep Space Waifu: FLAT JUSTICE[/b][/i] is another "chapter" of the DEEP SPACE WAIFU series. This time with [u]even better[/u] plot and overall quality! (if I can refer to this game with the word)

[H1]Why do you refer to these games as "series"? [/h1]
They follow the original concept of a funny, NSFW bullet hell / dating sim(?) game with bright, violent colours and and 2D art.
[H1]Why should I buy this game?[/h1]
Look at it's price. And you can beat your meat to it*
[H1]*Can I actually beat my meat to it? [/h1]
Depends on how desperate you are.
[H1]What about the gameplay..?[/h1]
The game is actually pretty fun to play. It has improved, especially if you consider the storyline.
It even has humorous cutscenes after you clear the stage. [I]Yatta! [/i]
[H1]So, should I really buy it? [/h1]
Yes, go ahead. Especially if you watch too much of "those" cartoons.
Or if you're above the 6th layer of irony and can't afford HuniePop.

[H1]The final verdict:[/h1]
[B]Why not. I liked it. [/b]
When you're finished, you can get the first game along with its DLC as well.

This... this is actually a surprisingly solid casual shmup, playable and enjoyable by pretty much anybody, though complete with higher difficulty levels that, as a nice change, aren't requirements to unlock a single thing. You can play the whole game on "super casual" without ever being told that only hardcore players can progress farther, but those players possessed of harder cores can turn the challenge up.

Of course there's eye candy, censored by default but trivially uncensored, and the engaging "cloth destruction" mechanic that distracts you from the actual dangerous mobs. The girls are generally attractive enough, and cover a broad range of anime tropes. They're lightly voiced and lightly animated, and "completing" a girl adds her picture to the gallery for future... reference.

The sound effects are sparse but sufficient, and the music is actually surprisingly good. Get it out of your head if you can! As for the dialogue, well, it's 100% terrible, but entertainingly so.

Oddly enough, I'm recommending this one. It's not very long, but it's fun, and it's super cheap.

When I purchased the first Deep Space Waifu I had initially purchased the game as a gag, not ever thinking I'd find any value in a game I purchased for only a $1. Little did I know that I would end up finding what at the time I'd consider a hidden gem on steam. Now after the increased sucess of the first game, Neko Climax Studios has managed to create a game that is simply amazing. So much heart and soul was put into the development of this game and it really shows in the games quality. The in game story is very funny. I love the way they added it into this one instead of it just throwing you in and going "strip some big ol' anime bozangas" like the previous game did. The gameplay is very fun, still continuing with the bullet hell shooter style as this game's predecessor except it changes things up a little by adding some new special attacks and two new bike styles. The art is really cute and drawn very well. The sheer talent that is put to work on these games and it blows my mind that they can sell this game and the previous title for only $1.99, and I purchased the game during the autumn sale so I got it for even cheaper. I highly recommend this game to anyone who loves bullet hells, qt anime girls, both, or are just looking for a cheaply priced game to pass the time. You won't be dissapointed.

And here we are back again, reviewing another game from Neko Climax studios we swore the first time was only a one time purchase, and that it slipped into our basket with a sale by mistake or that we really hated that friend that gifted this to us... Yeah right, lol. They keep making them and we keep buying them, don't we Mr Hentai-San :) ? There is something very nice about these games, uhm standing up ovation... HIde the feminist, prepare the inuendo jokes...let's review DSW Flat justice.

If you are a virgin to the deep space waifu series (see what I did there with the play on the word 'virgin' for an overly sexualised and nudity based game :) ) it is a shoot 'em up in space where you are a king bear (fluffy), riding a space bike (manly), shooting enemies (pew pew), but also shooting off clothes from a bunch of hot beauties below you ('bewbs'), who are distracting you with their talents (aaagh 'bewbs').

Flat justice gives us more new ladies than the original, with a catering to the uhm fans of flat chested breasted individuals, and also adds a story (if you are into anime you should be able to follow it, I didn't try to hard) about penetrating (hmmm) the police and dating every girl to find a mastermind behind some corrupt activity. But again, we do not play this game for the story do we? The game mechanics are top notch, and I think this is where a lot of fun is to be had since this is actually a great mechanical space shoot 'em up. 

The devs really listhened to our suggestions after the first game and they have added a new bike, new super weapons and specials. Hopefully we will get some babes of color with the next one, or a 3 bewb alien girl? Holding thumbs :) You still have the awesome neon menu colors, beautiful "bewbs" (optional nudy patch wink wink nudge nudge), great soundtrack and fun game play. I'm not a big fan of the whole 'cellphone' selection 'Tindery' type menu thing they have going, also when finished with a stage and after taking your photo, it would have been nice if the game just automatically goes to the next stage instead of going back to the selection screen. I think this would have improved the game flow as well. 

Pros - Beautiful babes, harder boss fights than original and enemies that are also more diverse strategy wise (MILF was quite a challenge and uhm I found it hard - that's what she said), good game mechanics, should run smoothly on most devices, wallpapers and photo's you may keep
Cons - Selection of a new stage manually after finishing one hampers game flow, not a fan of the 'Tindery' type menu, no babes of color or hot alien booty, not a game for everyone, once finished not alot of replayability, it will also offend with it's crude humor and nudity (again, if you are THAT guy, just ignore, move on and leave this one to us adults)

It's naughty, it's not PC and thats what makes it great. A worthy follow up to the original, still great, but needed minor tweeks. Thanks devs. 8/10

The Year is 2069. 
The world is in peril, as corruption takes over the once great city. 
It's up to you - Detective/King Bear, on your bitchin' space chopper armed to the teeth - to expose the corruption that is deeply penetrating and violating the Lolipolice. 

BY DATING ALL THE WAIFUS

The sequel to the 2017 Classic - Deep Space Waifu. Flat Justice adds a great many things to what was already debatebly (Not debatebly though) the ultimate game concept. A strip-em-up bullet hell game where sweet synthwave music and sounds of female ecstacy pulsate in tandem with a neon laced wet dream of damn fun danmaku. 

Graphics are improved as well as framerate, which is important because the "bullet" part of this game has been increased by A LOT. You'll be facing new enemies and bullet types out the gate - really putting your skills to the test. What skills? Isn't this just a joke game out of the anime creepyland mothership? No sir. It's not. 

The excellent artwork and varied characters you'll be flying around and disrobing is incredibly well done and also distracting, which adds a whole layer of challenge you may not be used to while dodging bullets. This provides a fun experience that brings you coming back for more. Like in the original; the game returns to title after completion of a date - which means you can get a date or two in when you just feel like dodging a few bullets and seeing some excellent plot. 

Speaking of plot? This sequel has one. And it's hilarious. The dialogue is extremely cheesy and well written and avoids the common trap of games today utilizing memes in lieu of straight out humor. I found myself unable to make it through a complete sentence without cracking. The writer deserves props. 

The classic weapons from the first game are back, the powerful rocket launcher and the enemy seeking laser - but wait! There's more! Short range lasers that emit from your ship dealing constant close range damage, a rotating shield that provides protection against enemies, and of course the HEAVY MACHINE GUN. 

Unlockable bikes with varied base shot types are excellent, and provide variety that will allow you to choose the best bike for the job when you revisit those old dates and aim for that 100%. 

The soundtrack is fantastic and features more variety and more intricate tracks than the original (Which was good, don't get me wrong) But from the start of the game the whole game exhudes synthwave glory. 

With new bosses, new enemies, new weapons, and new girls (Let me emphasise girls. If you're into boobmonsters this game lacks that. But if you like your women how you like your Earth? Strip on baby, strip on.) Flat Justice is a perfect sequel, and a blast to play. 

With no reservations? I give Deep Space Waifu : Flat Justice, a resounding 10/10. It's fun, funny, and sexy. Like that girl you never talked to. 

Go pick it up today, after all - The force needs you.

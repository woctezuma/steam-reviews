Excellent tiddies.

No, but for real though. The humour's 10/10. Story's pretty alright, it's everything you'd expect in a game like this: loose (heheh) excuses to string one sex scene after another. Absolutely breathtaking art, I haven't seen art assets this voluptuous since Violated Heroine. Definitely a solid H-game; hell, it's even a solid game on its own.

Wholly recommend. Great tiddies.

This game was gifted to me with no other information than "it's a porn game".
I am now addicted to both the grind and the shock value.
I've laughed a lot and had more confused boners than I care to admit.

-Free official uncensored patch without mosaic ( You can get it from discussion board )
-Proper translation.

The main story is pretty short, but if you try to get the achievements, you'll get your money's worth of gaming. The rpg element is not bad actually. The game plays like VH with turn based combat. What took the cake was the translation (I'm assuming the original was Japanese). In my opinion what makes a game like this good is a good translation. It was funny at times and very colloquial.

In conclusion, it was a short game with some nice plot, a ton of fetishes (even birth if you are into that kind of thing), and a lot to do. It had a great translation. 9/10. Worth

ok, since it's a hgame/erogame, i did not expect it being much.
but well this game is actually pretty good.

Gameplay is standard RPGMAKER, with only MC(Meltys).
And like all the other hgame, you got beat, you got meat.
You might have to grind resources time to time to pass certain stages.
But the first playthrough is quite easy to deal with.
Meltys Quest also has a new game plus that carries with your skill and stuff.
it even provides a easy way to get all scenes and CG set - if you feel too tired to get them all.

In short. Meltys Quest is fun, and it is generous for what it is.
CG is of course great. H part is unique and interesting.
Even the story isn't bad.

It might not be one of legendary indie games.
But it certain deserve recommendation.

Oh, and beware of something you might hate, Melty Quest is quite hardcore:
[spoiler]incest, prostitution, monster sex, pregnant, giving birth, futanari[/spoiler]

this is a really epic adventure about a woman that loves many creatures, gameplay is really straightforward, its a rpg with a few side quest, if you don't know what to do next, using the "hint" button helps a lot.

+awesome boss battles
+more than 50 cutscenes to unlock
+many different costumes to the beautiful main character
+amazing 2d graphics

20/10

This game is...incredible. I have played many H-games, on Steam and off, VNs and momre, and I have to say, this game is absolutely AMAZING. Outside of several occasional game-freezing bugs (which are actively being fixed, judging by the updates), it's a smooth experience all the way through, and, on Kogal mode (which I just finished my first playthrough with), it's a speedy and easy experience. Let's face it, if you're getting this game, you're getting the H-patch, and if you're getting all that, it's definitely not for the gameplay.

The best comparison I could think of for this game is the famed Queen Opala trilogy, which is a similar RPGMaker H-game experience, though a little cruder and more on the extreme side. In my opinion, this game is superior in every way. The art style is more consistent and the gameplay is smoother. While the depth of gameplay and world, and the length of the game is less, Meltys provides far more compact and convenient fun. Again, that's what we're looking for in this kind of game, right?

Looking at Meltys as a standalone game (with H-patch, of course), it's a fun choose-your-own-adventure ero book hidden behind some casual grinding and RPGMaker assets. The controls are extremely simple and easy to adapt to, the battles are quick and amusing, and everything just feels crisp and effiicient, which is often difficult to say about RPGMaker titles. 

The crispest thing, though, is the art. If you don't have the uncensor patch yet, get it RIGHT now https://www.patreon.com/posts/meltys-quest-15008521 and enjoy. This game has, by far, some of the best art I've ever seen, and while that's usually a matter of opinion, I'm comparing this to other incredible games like NekoPara and Princess Evangile. In sheer amount of art and scenes, variety of fetishes catered to, and general pacing, this game takes the absolute cake. I would probably pay $20 JUST for this sheer load of art by itself. The writing, translated from Japanese, is peppered with minor errors and could generally use some work, but I hardly found myself reading most of the time, if you get my drift.

I've rambled on long enough. In summary, if you are an H-game lover like me, or want to explore the world of H-games, or simply are looking for another interesting outlet for a special kind of desire, GET THIS GAME. Between the quality of the art and the effort that went in to making Meltys Quest a smooth, finished project, I hope it goes down in history as one of the best English H-games of our time.

Even though I have strong Christian beliefs, there were a bunch of things of the game I liked. I really enjoyed some of the music. The Noosel Plains music is one of the best songs in the game in my honest opinion. The story was also pretty good. Meltys' style of play reminded me of the old JRPG dungeon crawlers I played as a kid and teen. If you're offended by hentai viewing, then I suggest you not play this game. If you want a retro JRPG dungeon crawler experience with a good story and soundtrack to boot, but don't care about the hentai, then go ahead and get this game.

At the moment, this is the best porn game released on Steam.
Yes, there are better games with sex-scenes, but as far as something completely focused on being masturbation material goes? Meltys Quest is the best right now.

Combat is... alright, I guess. You can either strategize, or just brute-force the entire game. If you opt for latter, grinding really doesn't take any time at all.
The plot is light, and never really takes itself seriously. Even when the stakes are raised at points, you never really feel that there is much of a risk. This'd be a problem, if the game wasn't using the story just as setting for sex-scenes.
Art is also pretty nice, but might be a mixed bag to some people. For the record, all the characters are varying degrees of busty, there's no "normal breasts" or anything smaller here.
Getting different scenes is also pretty simple affair, though I wish each of the costumes you can unlock had at least one unique scene. But the volume currently available is pretty impressive.

So yeah, it is good. Compared to other RPG Maker porn games available, this is significantly more expensive, but what you're getting is actually competent release and translation, rather than barely functional machine-crap.
The game is pricy, though. I had no problem buying it on launch discount at 12 euros, but 20€ is kind of a lot. I'd say 15 would be sweet spot as far as pricing goes.

b"I've played more H-RPG Maker games than I care to admit, and I can safely say this among the best I've played. This is also how English releases should be handled. I really can't say enough about this. I'm so happy to see something that is getting a proper English localization and release. \n\n- Top-notch English translation, that's actually done by a human.\n\n- Completely uncensored with no mosaics!\n\nThese are the kinds of releases that are worth supporting. I want properly translated games, and official uncensor patches that are mosaic free. \n\nI'm not going to name any names, but I think some of these other studios need to take note here on how you do a proper release. Not some cheap cash-grab on Steam that costs a few bucks and has a poortranslation, with no official uncensor patch or mosaic free release.\n\nI really hope we see many more quality releases like this in the future!"

Meltys Quest is a rather fun, cute adventure that is, most importantly, quite sexy.

Even if it feels like I'm about 1/4 through the game already, I can really only comment on the art. It's internally consistent, but more importantly, it's really damn good. It's not your standard anime art style, but something a bit more different and in the right ways. Whoever drew the art for this game KNOWS how to do expressions really damn well, and it adds alot to the characters, but specifically Meltys (yes that is her literal ingame name. No I dunno why, it's super dumb, but It's grown on me. MY headcanon is that her parents were high when naming her and accidentally added the s at the end. Then again, the s is at the end, probly due to the trope of the mystical fantasy name).

The store page indicates that Meltys is a princess who must go on an adventure to save her familys kingdom, however what it doesn't tell you, is that she has an outrageous mouth on her, is massively lazy to the point of ignoring her fathers summons, aka, the kings summons in favor of a nap after some mad-heavy tanning, and likes to swear and talk big.
Alot.

So she's basically me in real life, only female, extremely hot, and a bit more lazy, also when saving an entire kingdom single-handedly from stupidly-horny monster men is placed upon her shoulders, she doesn't shut down, but becomes excessively determined.

This game is indeed an RPGMaker game, but unlike most others, this game is entirely a single character game. You will meet other characters, but you will only ever control Meltys, which is why She is constantly on the screen (beyond being able to admire her in one of literally over twenty costumes I believe) as when cutscene dialog happens, characters appear on the other side and grey out when not speaking on either side.

The art is just.. completely fantastic. But I will nitpick as a fellow artist. The loincloths are literally just wierd condoms. Literally. Every. Single. Loincloth. Is wrapped around the "length" of any monster that has one, either it looks wierd and just silly, or it looks like it's a diaper instead, it's just bizarre, and sort of takes you out of the game just a bit. I get that it's a censoring tactic, but irregardless it bugs me alot honestly. But beyond that, the quality of the art, and alot of the character designs just look great.

And ofcourse it wouldn't be Meltys Quest, or an RPGMaker game without action-y anime tropes that show before you even start on your quest, what with a butler character who shouts out special move names before actually doing them in a cutscene.

However, the cutscenes in the more simple way they're usually done, are still just completely fantastic. While it is just wiggling sprites around in the right ways, the movements are nicely done, and the effects are well-used. It's the best sprite wiggling I've seen yet, but I don't play RPGMaker games usually.

The music is great. Not too catchy, but not too boring that you'll quickly get tired of it, especially the battle and boss themes. Although after grinding quite a bit, I've gotten the victory tune stuck in my head, alongside the adorable graphic or Meltys cute, happy face when that displays at the bottom when you win any fight. Almost like the idea of finding loot off dead monster corpses excites her.

Though, boss-wise, some of them make little sense. The first dungeon boss is a normal human-like nurse chick. The third is a lamia. These don't make much sense, since Lamia are literally fairly decent-level demons, and the monster she resides over, are all just lizardmen with diapers and straight swords. Sure, the colors of both are pretty similar, but it still doesn't make too much sense. As for the first dungeon, all you face are goblins, so that for SURE makes little sense.

However, I really like how the first time you start a dungeon, you have to either evade every monster (which is fucking DIFFICULT by the way), or fight every single one while having gotten strong enough to handle them all and also challenge the boss of the dungeon, which only really spans one-four screens (as far as I know) ofcourse ignoring screens only accessible after the boss dies.
I say this because once you fight one monster and kill it, the exit is blocked off, and you must then kill the boss to even retreat, or, lose one fight, which you can do instantly via the "Give Up" option. Once you lose a battle, you're kicked out of the dungeon to the world map.

And ofcourse, once you lose a battle, you're treated with a lewd cutscene of the boss enjoying Meltys defeated body. Ofcourse it's censored (and it can be removed, just look to the pinned forum thread) but it's still just as nice honestly. Ofcourse I got the uncensor patch, because lewditity, or sexuality should never hide from prying eyes, but rather display all it has proudly, not caring who judges.

Which is when I will say, I love this game. It's sexy, cute, adorable, and every part of it is just... so. damn. GOOD.

Well-worth the asking price if you ask me, the translation of this is also top-notch. The "dev" of this version of this Eroge (Imagine that's jsut a way of saying "Lewd RPGMaker game" or just "Lewd RPG") is merely the one who translated it to English. They have a patreon, and while they don't give any real rewards, I'd pitch in a dollar.

People like this, need to be supported. I want more of this shit in my life dammit!

So, better yet, just buy this game. It's good, and you can skip lewd scenes and all cutscenes by holding Control. I believe the left one only. But more importantly, the gameplay is kind of addicting and really interesting, costumes eventually give you a single skill, but these skills are really good in the right situations, and item hoarding is VERY limited, which I adore completely.

Best of all: Death in this game, is not Game Over. That is.. if you WANT to do a trasitional RPG run of this game, you CAN treat the H-scenes as Game Overs.

Meltys Quest is the latest HRPG by Happy Life (in collaboration with Remtairy), brought to the English speaking fanbase thanks to Remtairy.

The first thing to note about this game is that, unlike the latest HRPGs releases from other publishers on Steam, this one offers a pretty good English translation (which keeps getting tweaked and fixed to correct some typos/grammar), constant updates to fix all the issues pointed out by users and a free and complete uncensor patch (i.e. no mosaic) downloadable from [url=https://www.patreon.com/posts/meltys-quest-15008521]Remtairy's patreon page[/url].

The CGs in the game are pretty well drawn and the naughty situations cover a wide range of fetishes, some managed better than other. Meltys is quite the charming lady, look wise and, in my opinion, personality wise. She's not the sharpest but she's got a nice heart and that's what I love about her.

The combat is turn based and is shown in a first person style, with just the enemies on screen. The way to learn skills by accruing experience fighting with a specific dress until the dress skill gets unlocked is interesting and gives the dresses another use other than just to unlock some sex scenes or complete some quests.

Last in comes a consideration about the price of this release. Compared to other games of this kind on Steam, this game is pricey. We've got used to 2-4€ affairs while this one came out with a 19,99€ price tag. This is because this game launched on Steam concurrently with its Japanese release and because it offers a true English localization instead of a stream of gibberish.
With that in mind, the 20€ price makes sense and I think it's more than worthwhile for what is offered here. Add to it the great launch discount bringing the price down to 11,99€, the level of support shown from day 1, a free uncensoring patch which even removes mosaic and I can do nothing else but recommend it wholeheartedly to anyone who's interested in these type of games.

i will start off by pointing out the absurd price for what the author likes to point out as an "RPG MAKER GAME" and for those that dont understand this it means that he is taking credit for a program that takes 4/5ths the work out of his game and does it for him providing a amature level programing set up along with the ability to import your own pictures and scenes.

so basically taking the program that is basically an infinite amount of legos for him to play with he still has managed to cock this up. after only 7 mins of playing this game i noticed how poorly used the assets that were given to him. you have open shower currents you cant go behind, path ways purly defined by lake tiles and pit tiles  with random games that you would believe to be able to go through but cant. and not this is just the first area, after grinding for 5 of my 7 mins to get past all the one hit kill enemys and "boss" which literally is programed to kill itself with a critical player hit once its clothes fall off i was able to commision a birdge to get past his greated plot device, a hole in the ground. 

after getting past the pit you are put in an event which is basically a scrpit made from sudo code that are linked to menus so you dont have to type. and it goes off with what i refuse to call writing. the writing is that equal to "the room" aka YOUR TEARING ME APART LISA.

after you get past the shit writing and even shiter map design which i frankly find to be very lazy. where if you leave a section you go to a world map and then walk to the next place. unlike something like pokemon where you actually go on an quest. please remember this is all the happens in the first 7 mins of a game you beat 2 bosses and already 1/4 the way done because there are 8 main bosses.

so if you can complete 1/4 of the game in 7 mins you have to ask "is this game short ?"  and to reply i would have to tell you no. after i refunded this game because having it sit in my library made me feel like a fool and cheated out of my money for medicro what i heasitate to call a game.

but no from what i can tell after looking into it more as i still had files and maps to look at because it was still installed on my pc i was able to find out that it is just more fluff than anything. 

but the final straw for this is that all this "hard work" that the author say he put in didnt even work at first until i rebooted it and fixed the graphical glitches of meltys body not showing up, the hardness selection screen remaining on during the game and the lag and poor response time. which the author will most likely defend by blaming the engine he claims in comments is comparable to the unreal engine.

so let me just get to the closing point if you you got this game here you wanted it for tits and thats all after looking at the other reviews that would be the case for why ever good review it got. but the game is censored in a way that is the laziest thing i have ever seen in my life. all this so he can force it through steams content filter and sell you a .99 cent game for 20 bucks


tldr 
not worth the money
shit teir rpg maker game
only thing the game is hentai
and that is even tumblr esk quality art 


i highly recommend not buying this game. also i tryed to keep this in a short sweet review previously but the author who can not take critisim arugued with me until i decided to put up a legit  review.

Melty's Quest was at it's core a very simple RPG game with adult content. I kept an open mind and I know this is suppose to be, "Melty's Quest", but some of the battles would have been really nice to have another character to be able to buff or cure status aliments. I say the last two bosses are an example of this problem, they poison you... A lot, with some other effect to hurt you as well. I found myself juggling cure and hits in, but also found most of the damage I put in being undone. I get this is the final boss, but when you do X damage and they undo X damage, then it defeats the purpose.

Now I played through the game looking for something for status aliments and I guess I somehow overlooked talking to a character which gives you one item that can be equip to help with these effects. Problem: didn't seem to help much. I had to grind Melty to a point that she was so OP nothing could phase her. Problem with this is now the game is tilted, now maybe hard mode with fix this, but I see the final bosses again making it unbalanced. Which is the problem with the game  a good portion of the way through, you're either going to be so OP or Struggling at the end. Also what is with the cap on items that can be carried? I can only have 2-7 of certain items, At least allow me to have 10 of every item if you're going to cap me on how many I can have.

The art is decent and I know this is an H-game. I'm taking that into account and this isn't going to win any, "Greatest game" awards, but the female characters all have huge boobs. Could we maybe have a little variety? One thing that alway annoys me in games and anime, the female characters must all have large boobs. I just want a range, little something for everyone. With that aside, the art is nice. Now the personallity of Melty, medieval princess who talks like she from the 20th century... Not saying so can't use lanague or that she need to talk like someone from those time, but the dialog is not nessessary to read. Even on my first play through I skimmed it at best.

Before I get roasted alive by people, "It's an H-Game, what were you expecting?" My answer would be, "This, I know what I was getting into, but that doesn't mean you have to make the character personallities flat." I'm not sure if this is the first game made by the developers, but hopefully moving forward they can take what they learned here and improve on their next game. Yes, I would like to see another game made by the developer, because besides all the flaw the overall game wasn't bad. I think with a bit more effort and work the next game created can be so much better. 

A couple more points that could be fixed is, skippable scence(the flash backs of the sisters needs a one click skip if you're playing NG+), The frame rate when you're blazing through battles and text drops to the point the game struggles to keep up and as much a the portrait of Melty is suppose to be their to show what each armor looks like it's in the way. I found it hard to see in the Noosel Plains the little trail since her portrait kind of covers it, also once you see each out fit due to playing the game multiple time in NG+ it becomes a eye sore. I wish there was an option to turn it off, please make an option to do so in the future it would help greatly. 

I know this game is on sale at the moment, but I would recommend not paying full price for the game. I think 20$ is a little much for 6-7 hours of game play(that's with an additional 2 NG+) if you're going for all achievement and ending I say you could rack upwards to 14-16 hours, but it begins to get dull around the 4th time through. For an H-Game it was did entertain me for a bit, but I'd like to see something a little longer in the future with some more variety of content. I wouldn't pay more then 10-12$ for Melty's Quest and that's just due to how short it is. Having multiple endings really doesn't make a game longer, I rather have 2 or 3 endings with a bit more length added to the game.

I have just spent the last several hours steamrolling through this game on pure princess mode.  And it is not worth it.   Sure this might be good to some.  But for an rpgmaker game it's not worth it.   If this game had no custom artwork and let the words do the talking this game could be far better, but for someone like me, this game is whole heartedly unsettling.   I think there are so many other games that are better for your money.

 ==== Review 2 in cluster D (#reviews = 12) ====

Out of all the hentai dungeon crawlers that I have played, this one ranks high on my favorites.  Story wasn't the best, but the gameplay was the good part. My only criticism is I wish the boss monster girls had more screen time because they had the best designs. Heck I wish they would have reformed like a certain someone later on. Such is life.

This is the best h game I've played. Its combat and gameplay isn't that in depth, but it's still fun and actually exists compared to a VN. The artwork is very nice, as is the translation to English. Unsensor patch is free and does not break achievements, definitely get it installed before palying.

I've played a couple of Nukige games on steam (and elswere) and I have to say, Meltys quest is right up there with the best. Funny dialogue (Not to mention dialogue that a person can understand compared to the other games out there), ok combat, and a lot of insentive to replay and get different endings. Overall very umm...satisfied with this game. Solid 9/10 and a good representative for its genre.

I thought I had struck gold with Dark Elf, The Heiress and Material Girl, but damn, this is off the scale compared with those.

Proper translation, truly uncensored, if you're into that sort of thing, which I'm guessing you are.

It's simply a better game of higher quality, and in turn has a higher asking price, which is completely fair and I was happy to pay it, because I got the sense of having gotten more game for my money

Excellent tiddies.

No, but for real though. The humour's 10/10. Story's pretty alright, it's everything you'd expect in a game like this: loose (heheh) excuses to string one sex scene after another. Absolutely breathtaking art, I haven't seen art assets this voluptuous since Violated Heroine. Definitely a solid H-game; hell, it's even a solid game on its own.

Wholly recommend. Great tiddies.

This was better than expected.
Good translation.
Good art.
Lewd scenes.

But bon't expect anything from the gameplay.
Just play it for the "plot".

Jokes aside, this is a really consistent work, more if we take into account another publisher/translator that only manages a machine translation and releases games with bug in terminal state condition.

I'm really expecting another game from the guys who brought us this, they really deserve a pat in the back.
Well done, really, and thanks for this.

**Currently in the final dungeon / not finished ** 

This is not only a good adult tile but also just a GOOD GAME in general. I've actually had more fun with Melty's than some of the AAA games lining the wall of Gamestop. Kind of like a SNES traditional RPG...but not. LOL 

If you are looking for good um.......content.......well, you get it and then some. Overall, I would rate this game a B++.

Did not expect much when buying this but gotta support all the H games steam is publishing. You will not be dissapointed, its got the perfect amount of engaging mechanics, story, music, replay value, humor, and of course hot 2d SLOOTS.
Really surprised me how good this game is cant wait to hear more from Happy Life and the guys involved here.

Hello.

I have played this game a lot since i bought it and i love it so much. Great story and characters (all) of them. I hope they'll do a sequel of sorts, maybe playing with Meltys child, or maybe creating your own princess by some choices in start of next game. I can't wait for it regardless.  *gives game a lot of thumps up*

meltys quest is exactly what you think it is and yet so much more.

I don't usually play Hentai games, but when I do, I play Melty's Quest.

It's a very well made game, and even though the combat is a bit easy I never found myself getting bored with it. Anybody that sits on a high horse will not likely enjoy it, but if you're like me and don't mind trudging around in the darkest part of the gutters, then by all means.

Be sure to get the unscensor patch though. I mean come on... it's a game about all kinda of dirty stuff. No patch = no fun.

The best RPG Maker hentai game I've ever played. The art is amazing, there are so many different scenarios and the writing is just superb. The game is a joy from beginning to end with some absurd plot twists and I haven't even finished it yet. I loved it a lot more than I expected.

First time I've been really impressed with a game of this sort.  In Meltys Quest a person does not have to stare at a single screenshot for 5 minutes of play, the encounters actually have several different screens that progress as the action does.  Not only that they don't have the same cookie cutter screenshots that other games use for several encounters.  Skills aren't freely given to you as you gain levels but come through wearing your, so many, costumes in multiple encounters.  Very nicely done imho. Thumbs up from me!!

This is probably the only decent and well-made eroge RPG game I have found on Steam soo far, because different from *certain games*, this one comes with a proper translation, the art has a great quality, which I guess is 720p, but it's still GREAT, the gameplay is actually good and well done, which is the main reason I kept playing past the 6 hours.
Not to mention, the dev is actually active, and trying to fix any typos and bugs he can! Kudos to him! More devs like these are needed in gaming industry!

If you're really looking for a game like this soo much, just grab this, it's worth the full price.

Oh yes.

You can play this game one-handed.

The main story is pretty short, but if you try to get the achievements, you'll get your money's worth of gaming. The rpg element is not bad actually. The game plays like VH with turn based combat. What took the cake was the translation (I'm assuming the original was Japanese). In my opinion what makes a game like this good is a good translation. It was funny at times and very colloquial.

In conclusion, it was a short game with some nice plot, a ton of fetishes (even birth if you are into that kind of thing), and a lot to do. It had a great translation. 9/10. Worth

[b]Come for the hentai, stay for the gameplay.[/b]

Pros:
- Good RPG elements such as character progression, crafting, unlockables, and secrets. If you pull out the hentai elements, it's a really good RPG.
- Wide variety of fetishes that welcomes to all people.
- Six endings to make up for replayability factor. Whether you want to play the game as the purest princess or the sluttiest whore, your choice.
- Different level of difficulties for people who sought for new challenges.

Cons:
- Can only be played alone in locked room with headset on.
- Some scenes may be a throw off to some people with vanilla tastes, (That delivering scenes still made me shiver)
- The look of disgust when people see you Steam profile.

I like it a lot! The original art was beautiful, the story was pretty funny, and the gameplay's decent. Though, the translation could've used more proofreading; even after the 1.01e patch, I found a good chunk of the dialogue pretty awkwardly-worded.

It's still a lot better than certain other eroge releases on steam, but it was still awkward enough for me to want to fix it myself. Thankfully anyone who wants to can, since the devs didn't put any special encryption on the map files.

Great Art, Fun Story, Plenty of Scenes and Costumes, and a free uncensor patch on day one? What's not to love?

I hope Hentai Game Developers get the hint that there is a bigger market than Japan. If the only way to get a game is a bootlegged, fan-translated mess, then nobody profits. But if a quality game like this gets a proper translation, appropriate censorship (none), and is sold on a convenient platformfor a fair price, then PEOPLE BUY IT! Now all we need is more devs to follow suit.

This game is a good example on why an adult section on Steam is more or less a requirement. A lot of adult game designers are looking to Steam to puiblish their work in an environment where they feel safe purchasing. This game is an example of this. 

Firstly, the mechanics are simple and easy to understand. Combat is not difficult and there is an option to jump straight to the loss screan (Which is why we buy these types of games) Characters are basic but it is a porn game so we didn't expect much in that department. The porn scenes are translated extremely well, not a single sign of broken English and change anything which required localising. 

Performance is not a issue. It runs on a toaster so don't worry about specs. Though, some glitches relating to saves corrupting have caught me off before. Can't tell if the update took that issue out but I haven't had it happen again.

b"HENTAI RUINS MY LIFE !!!\n\nAnyway, aside from all the sexual contents, boobs and boobs, this is a solid game. Even though it's an ero-RPG, it's not only just a fapping material, but it also has very nice gameplay and interesting story. It's very fun. The dialogues is  ****ing hillarious. The thing that made this game so enjoyable was the translation. THIS IS A QUALITY TRANSLATION. An ero-RPG with an excellent translation. PURRFECT!. This was one of the two main reasons that i like about this game a lot ( and i guess you already knew the other reason (   ) ). If you enjoy these kind of games, ero-RPGs, this game is a must have in your library. Buy and support the developer for making this amazing game. They worked really hard on this game. One of the best ero-RPG i assure you. A quality product that definitely worth your time."

ok, since it's a hgame/erogame, i did not expect it being much.
but well this game is actually pretty good.

Gameplay is standard RPGMAKER, with only MC(Meltys).
And like all the other hgame, you got beat, you got meat.
You might have to grind resources time to time to pass certain stages.
But the first playthrough is quite easy to deal with.
Meltys Quest also has a new game plus that carries with your skill and stuff.
it even provides a easy way to get all scenes and CG set - if you feel too tired to get them all.

In short. Meltys Quest is fun, and it is generous for what it is.
CG is of course great. H part is unique and interesting.
Even the story isn't bad.

It might not be one of legendary indie games.
But it certain deserve recommendation.

Oh, and beware of something you might hate, Melty Quest is quite hardcore:
[spoiler]incest, prostitution, monster sex, pregnant, giving birth, futanari[/spoiler]

Yes, this game is exactly what you think it is. It's for weaboo perverts who live with their parents in the attic, bla bla bla bla.

But this is actually a fairly decent RPG! At first I thought it would just be a few hours of enjoyment but it turned out to be something I put over 20h in and went for 100% achiv just because it was so much fun!

Simple and silly but enjoyable story. Mostly well written / translated. GREAT artwork. Basic yet satisfying gameplay. Funny characters and lots of stuff (monsters) to do. Replayability is a bit eh once you've seen all the endings. And it's not very hard, even when going new game+. You can just grind it out if you have problems. 

All in all a very high quality game that's about hundred times better than most other H-RPG games out there.

Of all the shitty, poorly translated H-games, here we have this game rising up to save the hentai gaming industry. This game actually has a decent translation and because of that you can purely enjoy the game and storyline (then the H-scenes are just a bonus to the game). It's worth every cent but I bought it at 50% off. Just buy it and play it and dont forget to lock the doors. And of course, what's an H-game without an uncensored patch? You can get the patch FREE somewhere in the discussion. 

But before I close my review, I just want to say that I love the story. The character development, the plot twist, and the romantic ending (finish the game at pure route first) and of course the sex jokes inserted here and there (pun not intended)

I recommend supporting the guy who translated this in patreon and hope it wont only stop here. We need more games like this. This guy's gonna save us.

I seriously thought this was going to be some cookie cutter crap, but the positive reviews made me do it... I have done this mistake many times before but this time it was worth it.

This game is hot as hell, amazing art, epic dialogue, epic H-scenes, everything is really funny, the game isn't punishing, it's very likely the best H-RPG ever made (yes it overtook Sengoku Rance for me) I haven't even finished it yet but with all the multiple endings and achievements to hunt, I'm going to be playing (the game and also with myself) a whole lot of Meltys. The gameplay isn't anywhere near as filler heavy as all the commercial Japanese ero RPGs I have played, it's fast paced and you can skip like all battles if you feel like it.

For the devs, please continue doing what you're doing. I love you eternally (idc about your gender). I recommend this game to all men and women of culture.

But how does it play without the uncensoring patch? I don't care, I don't know, why'd you even ask?

I downloaded the patch to uncensor it, which seemed to work fine. https://www.patreon.com/posts/meltys-quest-15008521 Otherwise you'll have to put up with black borders over the naughty bits. I found the smegma bits pretty gross, it's a bit weird overall, but I've seen a lot of porn too, so I'm not traumatized at all :)

Save regularly, a couple of times I had to exit the game because it hung. Once it hung right in the middle of an extended series of dialogues which was very annoying, but it worked okay after exiting the game and reloading. Lots of hentai guaranteed all throughout, with the patch, and the dialogue could be a bit cringey and obviously translated. Went with a mega-slut runthrough which had a couple of endings, one with your boyfriend and his friends, the other with your family. Guess I'll be playing the anti-slut version and see how that works out. Mostly used healing and a weapon which worked out okay. Didn't bother with the best costume. Pay attention to the tips from the Encyclopaedia halfling in the first town on the western side, skipping dialogue can be nice.

In short, not for the morally strict, or morally weak or easily peer shamed.

Game is not grindy if one plays the Kougai mode first and knows that the flow of the quests will give all the gold a player can use. Over the course of actual traversing the game, a player will get the needed castle resources and armor materials.

Game is very much completable with one hand on a mouse... for obvious reasons. (except Alfredo's part... where it makes mockery in comparison to "traditional" hack and slash RPGs, a blatant call out to Zelda games, fitting in with an Hentai RPG)

This game mocks some RPG economy tropes all over. See the owner of that mansion and his quests leading to Meltys' and his conversation about "effort"...

This game wil throw confusing boners. Be warned of the bait. Hence not for the morally weak.

This game will play with sexuality on all playing sides. Not for the morally strict.

This game will play on RPG tropes, lampshades, and subverts many of them.

The art for the most part is fine... except Garnet's princess dress. How does she shoulder? Or for that matter, the starting point of her breasts are literally at her collar bones. It looks like there is no shoulder at all. During this time of review, the only real bug I encountered is  one where I did not skip the initial cutscenes, but the kougai selection box remains "stuck". To begin a game with it cleared, I had to skip the very first cutscene.

Best played with New Game + on True Princess mode, I don't think the game scales in relation to your previous equipment, and you do not need to worry about slut levels anymore for your useful armors already obtained from kougai mode.

The actual combat? Earthbound-esq, but with a single character, no rolling health meter but a fixed bar - the rolling does not allow the Earthbound reaction and it is not needed with a single character in play. Art shifts as you progress in a boss battle adding to that "final climax"... Combat shifts though once a player plays with Alfredo, a mockery of the standard fare hero.

Short and sweet. Be sure to clean up after. /s

Also, Steam - I used this product for more than five minutes : just look at the cheesements I have. This is concerning "offline mode" interactions and your review restrictions to stop junk data in bias.

This game is...incredible. I have played many H-games, on Steam and off, VNs and momre, and I have to say, this game is absolutely AMAZING. Outside of several occasional game-freezing bugs (which are actively being fixed, judging by the updates), it's a smooth experience all the way through, and, on Kogal mode (which I just finished my first playthrough with), it's a speedy and easy experience. Let's face it, if you're getting this game, you're getting the H-patch, and if you're getting all that, it's definitely not for the gameplay.

The best comparison I could think of for this game is the famed Queen Opala trilogy, which is a similar RPGMaker H-game experience, though a little cruder and more on the extreme side. In my opinion, this game is superior in every way. The art style is more consistent and the gameplay is smoother. While the depth of gameplay and world, and the length of the game is less, Meltys provides far more compact and convenient fun. Again, that's what we're looking for in this kind of game, right?

Looking at Meltys as a standalone game (with H-patch, of course), it's a fun choose-your-own-adventure ero book hidden behind some casual grinding and RPGMaker assets. The controls are extremely simple and easy to adapt to, the battles are quick and amusing, and everything just feels crisp and effiicient, which is often difficult to say about RPGMaker titles. 

The crispest thing, though, is the art. If you don't have the uncensor patch yet, get it RIGHT now https://www.patreon.com/posts/meltys-quest-15008521 and enjoy. This game has, by far, some of the best art I've ever seen, and while that's usually a matter of opinion, I'm comparing this to other incredible games like NekoPara and Princess Evangile. In sheer amount of art and scenes, variety of fetishes catered to, and general pacing, this game takes the absolute cake. I would probably pay $20 JUST for this sheer load of art by itself. The writing, translated from Japanese, is peppered with minor errors and could generally use some work, but I hardly found myself reading most of the time, if you get my drift.

I've rambled on long enough. In summary, if you are an H-game lover like me, or want to explore the world of H-games, or simply are looking for another interesting outlet for a special kind of desire, GET THIS GAME. Between the quality of the art and the effort that went in to making Meltys Quest a smooth, finished project, I hope it goes down in history as one of the best English H-games of our time.

Meltys Quest is the first H-game I've ever bothered to pay for, after numerous disappointments in the past with sub-standard quality work.

I have yet to finish the game, but in my three hours played, Meltys' Quest has taken her far and wide. There is passable RPG-style progression and combat in the game, with turn-based combat, enemy weaknesses, leveling, and equipment you can buy of various kinds. You can gather various outfits throughout the game for Melty to wear, each with a passive benefit you get while wearing it during combat, and a unique skill that can be unlocked by using the outfit in enough battles (which can be then used with or without the outfit equipped).

The story is fairly generic, and stereotypical, but I don't think that any of us are really here for the story. If anything, the stereotypical nature of it all (Princess of a kingdom goes to try and save her kingdom from the monsters!) makes it quite enjoyable. You spend the game going throughout your kingdom, and later on the monster kingdom, fighting various monsters and bosses. There's a good variety here.

Most of us are here for the sex, however. In that regard, this game delivers quite well. There are two ways to get to "sex scenes" in this game. The first way is either to lose a battle against monsters, or to "give up," against them. In that case, a unique scene depending on the monster (or boss) you are fighting plays out, and they are all very well drawn. The second way is by doing various "jobs" within the game, which progress in their own manner. Melty has a "sl*t level" as well that is tied to the various acts she performs, and as this increases, the outfits you can wear as well as the strength of certain attacks you can perform increases over time. In this way, losing battles is a legitimate way to play the game - I myself lose quite a few on purpose just to see the scenes!

I will have to warn everyone however - the scenes cater to just about every taste out there. Certain types of sexual fetishes are not my thing, and yet some of them might surprise you out of nowhere. Still, you can always just proceed through such scenes until you find the art that you actually wanted in other scenes.

It isn't a very long game (I believe I'm probably about halfway through, from the looks of things), but it has been enjoyable enough that I can recommend it. More H-games need this level of polish put in. The art, music, and overall gameplay experience is quite enjoyable. The english translation as well - while often filled with grammatical issues and typos - is also very often hilarious and filled with colloquialisms that make it all quite enjoyable to read.

God bless Japan.


I'm very happy that a game like this was actually released on Steam, as I'm a huge fan of H-games both Western and from Japanese devs. I apologize in advance but this review will not exactly talk about Meltys Quest in specific. I will say this though: The game is good, a bit difficult at the start and slightly grindy (but not too bad), but it's a lot better than your typical H-game RPG. The H-scenes are also very tame and well-made. Good writing/translations with very, very minor errors, and the plot is alright and nothing too special (you might like the story, you might not, whatever).

I truly and honestly hope this marks the beginning of an era where the Western video game market finally gets rid of this mentality where "guns, blood, and killing are perfectly fine, but if a nipple gets shown anywhere in the game, then it's the end of the world." I'm not saying to make the reverse be true either: video games are video games, you play them for fun, and I believe that violence and sexual themes should both be allowed equally. I also hope Japan will eventually rewrite/repeal their archaic censorship laws so that H-games can be seen in a light that's accessible to everyone, as censorship turns off a lot of people, but that's maybe asking for too much.

We've been pretty tame about the whole "sexual themes are not okay, but guns and violence are" thing as of late, but most people who feel the same way I do can feel this stigma where we're still very reluctant to start marketing these kinds of games so openly. The fact that a game as raunchy as this - Nekopara has very "vanilla" and "reserved" H-scenes compared to the ones in this game where you literally w.hore yourself out and get dicked on by monsters - is available on a platform as popular on Steam is a huge achievement, and could definitely be a sign of change, a good change.

If you share the same hopes and dreams that I do of seeing more H-games in the Western market, please support the devs by buying this game, and support other Western/Japanese H-game devs by buying their games on dlsite, itch.io, or supporting them on patreon, etc. This sends a message to Japanese H-game devs that says "Hey, there's a market for this kind of thing over here too and we welcome it!" Voting with your wallet can make all the difference.

*edit 11/22/2017*: heavy changes to wording in the review, and I have also nominated this game for the Steam Awards 2017 for the Write-In category, with the category name being "Redefining Social/Cultural Norms". Bit of a long shot, but I didn't have any other nominations in mind for a game-category pairing other than joining in on the "Better Battlefront 2" meme.

Melty's Quest is an honest god good RPG. The art is amazing, the music is good, the story is actually nice, there multiple endings, lewd patch is free, being pure is difficult but fun as hell, and you can play the entire game one handed.

If you buy this game get the free lewd patch since i'm sure that is why you buying it but do actually play the game. The gameplay is actually nice and simple. 

Be a man and play the game on online mode you fuck. Also tell your friends you bought it. They'll be filled with envy knowing they don't have the guts to buy it and play it. Also one hand mode.

Sidenote: I picked this game for Mom's Spaghetti award... it didn't get it

Even though I have strong Christian beliefs, there were a bunch of things of the game I liked. I really enjoyed some of the music. The Noosel Plains music is one of the best songs in the game in my honest opinion. The story was also pretty good. Meltys' style of play reminded me of the old JRPG dungeon crawlers I played as a kid and teen. If you're offended by hentai viewing, then I suggest you not play this game. If you want a retro JRPG dungeon crawler experience with a good story and soundtrack to boot, but don't care about the hentai, then go ahead and get this game.

A really funny game with brilliant writting. It's one of the few H-Games on Steam with actually gameplay. Its actually suprisingly fun. Don't get me wrong, you're buying the game for the b00bs, and there are plenty of naughty bits in the game to go around, but the game is able to be more than just a $20 p0rno. 

The only thing I could see that could turn some people off is that it panders to a few fetishes, however this is all optional. (However that doesn't make all the pissing, birthing, and old man blowing scenes any less scaring... ew.)

So first things first:  This game is a blast. 
Light hearted, over-sexualized and fun. Whatever your strange hentai fetish might be, I guess you'll find something to suit your palate. 
The GC is really nicely done (I do recommend a uncensoring patch though if you dont like huge black censor bars), the music as okay-ish as to be expected from a RPG Maker game. Easy on the ears but wholly forgettable and you'll be fine if you don't play it without any score alltogether. 
Personally I would have liked a bit more voice acting/accompainment in the H scenes but what's in it suits just fine. Harmless and forgettable though; just like the rest of the score and sounds used. 

What I really like are the gathering/crafting elements, which are implemented pretty clumsily but which are also overall pretty fitting in a game which, on normal difficulty, isn't set out to challenge you in any way - some of you folks might want to start with the higher difficulty option right from the start. Everything in this game is solely for entertainment purposes, be it the prostitution side quests, the bland but somehow addicting resource gathering or the sometimes hilarious "plot" strings with one of the most potty mouthed princesses you'll ever come across. 

If you want to relax, have a good laugh or just like to ogle hentai CG, just pop in good ol' Meltys. It is worth your time if you're in any way into H games.

A really good one of these things. Localisation is good, spelling is on point (noticed all of one mistake in the entire game and it was a orc so like... maybe it was intentional?)

Just you know, be aware if you've got discord running it will tell everyone what you're playing and then when you stop playing suddenly and start talking again they know that you just finished if you know what I mean.

The only cirticism I have is that part of the core loop to get the good endings involves some resource collecting I wasn't really up for but save editors do exist if you want to opt out of that.

Glad I bought this game, so much of the like contennt on steam is low effort trash, you can feel that a wierd amount of love went into this translation (Putting ps4 controls in the controls tutorial is a specific form of madness that I can really get behind).

You should probably pick up the free uncensor patch. 

Steam says I've played for only a few minutes for reasons I don't understand, My playthrough from start to finish took around 7 hours (did most sidequests, grabbed all the endings you can get at slut level 103 and completed castle, in game time says 4 hours and a half so I have no idea whats going on with the timers in this game because 100% I was playing a lot longer).

At the moment, this is the best porn game released on Steam.
Yes, there are better games with sex-scenes, but as far as something completely focused on being masturbation material goes? Meltys Quest is the best right now.

Combat is... alright, I guess. You can either strategize, or just brute-force the entire game. If you opt for latter, grinding really doesn't take any time at all.
The plot is light, and never really takes itself seriously. Even when the stakes are raised at points, you never really feel that there is much of a risk. This'd be a problem, if the game wasn't using the story just as setting for sex-scenes.
Art is also pretty nice, but might be a mixed bag to some people. For the record, all the characters are varying degrees of busty, there's no "normal breasts" or anything smaller here.
Getting different scenes is also pretty simple affair, though I wish each of the costumes you can unlock had at least one unique scene. But the volume currently available is pretty impressive.

So yeah, it is good. Compared to other RPG Maker porn games available, this is significantly more expensive, but what you're getting is actually competent release and translation, rather than barely functional machine-crap.
The game is pricy, though. I had no problem buying it on launch discount at 12 euros, but 20€ is kind of a lot. I'd say 15 would be sweet spot as far as pricing goes.

Probably the best ero-RPG ever on steam.

It has all the qualities we are looking for:
- A very good plot
- Great artwork
- A cute heroin and characters
- A high quality human made english translation (not some machine translated bs)
- Many sex scenes
- Many sex possibilities, everyone's likes are covered I think
- It's 100% uncensored (no mosaics)
- Great supports from the devs, errors are fixed asap
- Devs invested in their work and enthusiasts
- And so much more to add to this list

I usually don't write reviews for the games I bought but I made an exception for this one.
This game is totally worth its price, a rare gem on steam. And if you got a little extra money, please support them on patreon also.
I highly recommend this game, please support the authors so we can get more games like this one in the future.

b"I've played more H-RPG Maker games than I care to admit, and I can safely say this among the best I've played. This is also how English releases should be handled. I really can't say enough about this. I'm so happy to see something that is getting a proper English localization and release. \n\n- Top-notch English translation, that's actually done by a human.\n\n- Completely uncensored with no mosaics!\n\nThese are the kinds of releases that are worth supporting. I want properly translated games, and official uncensor patches that are mosaic free. \n\nI'm not going to name any names, but I think some of these other studios need to take note here on how you do a proper release. Not some cheap cash-grab on Steam that costs a few bucks and has a poortranslation, with no official uncensor patch or mosaic free release.\n\nI really hope we see many more quality releases like this in the future!"

Meltys Quest is a rather fun, cute adventure that is, most importantly, quite sexy.

Even if it feels like I'm about 1/4 through the game already, I can really only comment on the art. It's internally consistent, but more importantly, it's really damn good. It's not your standard anime art style, but something a bit more different and in the right ways. Whoever drew the art for this game KNOWS how to do expressions really damn well, and it adds alot to the characters, but specifically Meltys (yes that is her literal ingame name. No I dunno why, it's super dumb, but It's grown on me. MY headcanon is that her parents were high when naming her and accidentally added the s at the end. Then again, the s is at the end, probly due to the trope of the mystical fantasy name).

The store page indicates that Meltys is a princess who must go on an adventure to save her familys kingdom, however what it doesn't tell you, is that she has an outrageous mouth on her, is massively lazy to the point of ignoring her fathers summons, aka, the kings summons in favor of a nap after some mad-heavy tanning, and likes to swear and talk big.
Alot.

So she's basically me in real life, only female, extremely hot, and a bit more lazy, also when saving an entire kingdom single-handedly from stupidly-horny monster men is placed upon her shoulders, she doesn't shut down, but becomes excessively determined.

This game is indeed an RPGMaker game, but unlike most others, this game is entirely a single character game. You will meet other characters, but you will only ever control Meltys, which is why She is constantly on the screen (beyond being able to admire her in one of literally over twenty costumes I believe) as when cutscene dialog happens, characters appear on the other side and grey out when not speaking on either side.

The art is just.. completely fantastic. But I will nitpick as a fellow artist. The loincloths are literally just wierd condoms. Literally. Every. Single. Loincloth. Is wrapped around the "length" of any monster that has one, either it looks wierd and just silly, or it looks like it's a diaper instead, it's just bizarre, and sort of takes you out of the game just a bit. I get that it's a censoring tactic, but irregardless it bugs me alot honestly. But beyond that, the quality of the art, and alot of the character designs just look great.

And ofcourse it wouldn't be Meltys Quest, or an RPGMaker game without action-y anime tropes that show before you even start on your quest, what with a butler character who shouts out special move names before actually doing them in a cutscene.

However, the cutscenes in the more simple way they're usually done, are still just completely fantastic. While it is just wiggling sprites around in the right ways, the movements are nicely done, and the effects are well-used. It's the best sprite wiggling I've seen yet, but I don't play RPGMaker games usually.

The music is great. Not too catchy, but not too boring that you'll quickly get tired of it, especially the battle and boss themes. Although after grinding quite a bit, I've gotten the victory tune stuck in my head, alongside the adorable graphic or Meltys cute, happy face when that displays at the bottom when you win any fight. Almost like the idea of finding loot off dead monster corpses excites her.

Though, boss-wise, some of them make little sense. The first dungeon boss is a normal human-like nurse chick. The third is a lamia. These don't make much sense, since Lamia are literally fairly decent-level demons, and the monster she resides over, are all just lizardmen with diapers and straight swords. Sure, the colors of both are pretty similar, but it still doesn't make too much sense. As for the first dungeon, all you face are goblins, so that for SURE makes little sense.

However, I really like how the first time you start a dungeon, you have to either evade every monster (which is fucking DIFFICULT by the way), or fight every single one while having gotten strong enough to handle them all and also challenge the boss of the dungeon, which only really spans one-four screens (as far as I know) ofcourse ignoring screens only accessible after the boss dies.
I say this because once you fight one monster and kill it, the exit is blocked off, and you must then kill the boss to even retreat, or, lose one fight, which you can do instantly via the "Give Up" option. Once you lose a battle, you're kicked out of the dungeon to the world map.

And ofcourse, once you lose a battle, you're treated with a lewd cutscene of the boss enjoying Meltys defeated body. Ofcourse it's censored (and it can be removed, just look to the pinned forum thread) but it's still just as nice honestly. Ofcourse I got the uncensor patch, because lewditity, or sexuality should never hide from prying eyes, but rather display all it has proudly, not caring who judges.

Which is when I will say, I love this game. It's sexy, cute, adorable, and every part of it is just... so. damn. GOOD.

Well-worth the asking price if you ask me, the translation of this is also top-notch. The "dev" of this version of this Eroge (Imagine that's jsut a way of saying "Lewd RPGMaker game" or just "Lewd RPG") is merely the one who translated it to English. They have a patreon, and while they don't give any real rewards, I'd pitch in a dollar.

People like this, need to be supported. I want more of this shit in my life dammit!

So, better yet, just buy this game. It's good, and you can skip lewd scenes and all cutscenes by holding Control. I believe the left one only. But more importantly, the gameplay is kind of addicting and really interesting, costumes eventually give you a single skill, but these skills are really good in the right situations, and item hoarding is VERY limited, which I adore completely.

Best of all: Death in this game, is not Game Over. That is.. if you WANT to do a trasitional RPG run of this game, you CAN treat the H-scenes as Game Overs.

Meltys Quest is the latest HRPG by Happy Life (in collaboration with Remtairy), brought to the English speaking fanbase thanks to Remtairy.

The first thing to note about this game is that, unlike the latest HRPGs releases from other publishers on Steam, this one offers a pretty good English translation (which keeps getting tweaked and fixed to correct some typos/grammar), constant updates to fix all the issues pointed out by users and a free and complete uncensor patch (i.e. no mosaic) downloadable from [url=https://www.patreon.com/posts/meltys-quest-15008521]Remtairy's patreon page[/url].

The CGs in the game are pretty well drawn and the naughty situations cover a wide range of fetishes, some managed better than other. Meltys is quite the charming lady, look wise and, in my opinion, personality wise. She's not the sharpest but she's got a nice heart and that's what I love about her.

The combat is turn based and is shown in a first person style, with just the enemies on screen. The way to learn skills by accruing experience fighting with a specific dress until the dress skill gets unlocked is interesting and gives the dresses another use other than just to unlock some sex scenes or complete some quests.

Last in comes a consideration about the price of this release. Compared to other games of this kind on Steam, this game is pricey. We've got used to 2-4€ affairs while this one came out with a 19,99€ price tag. This is because this game launched on Steam concurrently with its Japanese release and because it offers a true English localization instead of a stream of gibberish.
With that in mind, the 20€ price makes sense and I think it's more than worthwhile for what is offered here. Add to it the great launch discount bringing the price down to 11,99€, the level of support shown from day 1, a free uncensoring patch which even removes mosaic and I can do nothing else but recommend it wholeheartedly to anyone who's interested in these type of games.

i will start off by pointing out the absurd price for what the author likes to point out as an "RPG MAKER GAME" and for those that dont understand this it means that he is taking credit for a program that takes 4/5ths the work out of his game and does it for him providing a amature level programing set up along with the ability to import your own pictures and scenes.

so basically taking the program that is basically an infinite amount of legos for him to play with he still has managed to cock this up. after only 7 mins of playing this game i noticed how poorly used the assets that were given to him. you have open shower currents you cant go behind, path ways purly defined by lake tiles and pit tiles  with random games that you would believe to be able to go through but cant. and not this is just the first area, after grinding for 5 of my 7 mins to get past all the one hit kill enemys and "boss" which literally is programed to kill itself with a critical player hit once its clothes fall off i was able to commision a birdge to get past his greated plot device, a hole in the ground. 

after getting past the pit you are put in an event which is basically a scrpit made from sudo code that are linked to menus so you dont have to type. and it goes off with what i refuse to call writing. the writing is that equal to "the room" aka YOUR TEARING ME APART LISA.

after you get past the shit writing and even shiter map design which i frankly find to be very lazy. where if you leave a section you go to a world map and then walk to the next place. unlike something like pokemon where you actually go on an quest. please remember this is all the happens in the first 7 mins of a game you beat 2 bosses and already 1/4 the way done because there are 8 main bosses.

so if you can complete 1/4 of the game in 7 mins you have to ask "is this game short ?"  and to reply i would have to tell you no. after i refunded this game because having it sit in my library made me feel like a fool and cheated out of my money for medicro what i heasitate to call a game.

but no from what i can tell after looking into it more as i still had files and maps to look at because it was still installed on my pc i was able to find out that it is just more fluff than anything. 

but the final straw for this is that all this "hard work" that the author say he put in didnt even work at first until i rebooted it and fixed the graphical glitches of meltys body not showing up, the hardness selection screen remaining on during the game and the lag and poor response time. which the author will most likely defend by blaming the engine he claims in comments is comparable to the unreal engine.

so let me just get to the closing point if you you got this game here you wanted it for tits and thats all after looking at the other reviews that would be the case for why ever good review it got. but the game is censored in a way that is the laziest thing i have ever seen in my life. all this so he can force it through steams content filter and sell you a .99 cent game for 20 bucks


tldr 
not worth the money
shit teir rpg maker game
only thing the game is hentai
and that is even tumblr esk quality art 


i highly recommend not buying this game. also i tryed to keep this in a short sweet review previously but the author who can not take critisim arugued with me until i decided to put up a legit  review.

Melty's Quest was at it's core a very simple RPG game with adult content. I kept an open mind and I know this is suppose to be, "Melty's Quest", but some of the battles would have been really nice to have another character to be able to buff or cure status aliments. I say the last two bosses are an example of this problem, they poison you... A lot, with some other effect to hurt you as well. I found myself juggling cure and hits in, but also found most of the damage I put in being undone. I get this is the final boss, but when you do X damage and they undo X damage, then it defeats the purpose.

Now I played through the game looking for something for status aliments and I guess I somehow overlooked talking to a character which gives you one item that can be equip to help with these effects. Problem: didn't seem to help much. I had to grind Melty to a point that she was so OP nothing could phase her. Problem with this is now the game is tilted, now maybe hard mode with fix this, but I see the final bosses again making it unbalanced. Which is the problem with the game  a good portion of the way through, you're either going to be so OP or Struggling at the end. Also what is with the cap on items that can be carried? I can only have 2-7 of certain items, At least allow me to have 10 of every item if you're going to cap me on how many I can have.

The art is decent and I know this is an H-game. I'm taking that into account and this isn't going to win any, "Greatest game" awards, but the female characters all have huge boobs. Could we maybe have a little variety? One thing that alway annoys me in games and anime, the female characters must all have large boobs. I just want a range, little something for everyone. With that aside, the art is nice. Now the personallity of Melty, medieval princess who talks like she from the 20th century... Not saying so can't use lanague or that she need to talk like someone from those time, but the dialog is not nessessary to read. Even on my first play through I skimmed it at best.

Before I get roasted alive by people, "It's an H-Game, what were you expecting?" My answer would be, "This, I know what I was getting into, but that doesn't mean you have to make the character personallities flat." I'm not sure if this is the first game made by the developers, but hopefully moving forward they can take what they learned here and improve on their next game. Yes, I would like to see another game made by the developer, because besides all the flaw the overall game wasn't bad. I think with a bit more effort and work the next game created can be so much better. 

A couple more points that could be fixed is, skippable scence(the flash backs of the sisters needs a one click skip if you're playing NG+), The frame rate when you're blazing through battles and text drops to the point the game struggles to keep up and as much a the portrait of Melty is suppose to be their to show what each armor looks like it's in the way. I found it hard to see in the Noosel Plains the little trail since her portrait kind of covers it, also once you see each out fit due to playing the game multiple time in NG+ it becomes a eye sore. I wish there was an option to turn it off, please make an option to do so in the future it would help greatly. 

I know this game is on sale at the moment, but I would recommend not paying full price for the game. I think 20$ is a little much for 6-7 hours of game play(that's with an additional 2 NG+) if you're going for all achievement and ending I say you could rack upwards to 14-16 hours, but it begins to get dull around the 4th time through. For an H-Game it was did entertain me for a bit, but I'd like to see something a little longer in the future with some more variety of content. I wouldn't pay more then 10-12$ for Melty's Quest and that's just due to how short it is. Having multiple endings really doesn't make a game longer, I rather have 2 or 3 endings with a bit more length added to the game.

Keep up the good work guys!

How about adding moving waifus in the next one? You know some moving animated lolis who try to dodge my bullets while I'm trying to rip off their clothes and salivating on my keyboard?

i love this game but its buggy and glitchy like for example i would swipe no one the first girl and its still stuck on the same girl or if you choose another waifu it still takes you to the level with the first girl and i also notice if i quit and go back the screen is stuck. I hope the creators fix this soon

b' \n\nAs of Dec 09 2017, 12:54 AM in PST +09:00, this review has been flagged by developers because my korean review was not related with topic.\n\nWhat I wrote is I hate flat chest. And I haven\'t thought those "Flat Justice" in game title means flat boobies of girls in game.\n\nIt\'s my personal opinion how I can tell about boobies god damn it\n\nDec 15th, 02:28 AM  in PST +09:00, I\'m finally able to show this review. Shame on you dev teams, it\'s my freedom to talk about how I think about flat chest!'

Melty's Quest is an honest god good RPG. The art is amazing, the music is good, the story is actually nice, there multiple endings, lewd patch is free, being pure is difficult but fun as hell, and you can play the entire game one handed.

If you buy this game get the free lewd patch since i'm sure that is why you buying it but do actually play the game. The gameplay is actually nice and simple. 

Be a man and play the game on online mode you fuck. Also tell your friends you bought it. They'll be filled with envy knowing they don't have the guts to buy it and play it. Also one hand mode.

Sidenote: I picked this game for Mom's Spaghetti award... it didn't get it

I'ts ok, if you patched it it gets a little bit  more interesting but what do you expect? You get exactly what you paid for, nothing more, nothing less. gets kinda grindy and repetitive after a while though

Even though I have strong Christian beliefs, there were a bunch of things of the game I liked. I really enjoyed some of the music. The Noosel Plains music is one of the best songs in the game in my honest opinion. The story was also pretty good. Meltys' style of play reminded me of the old JRPG dungeon crawlers I played as a kid and teen. If you're offended by hentai viewing, then I suggest you not play this game. If you want a retro JRPG dungeon crawler experience with a good story and soundtrack to boot, but don't care about the hentai, then go ahead and get this game.

Out of all the hentai dungeon crawlers that I have played, this one ranks high on my favorites.  Story wasn't the best, but the gameplay was the good part. My only criticism is I wish the boss monster girls had more screen time because they had the best designs. Heck I wish they would have reformed like a certain someone later on. Such is life.

I have just spent the last several hours steamrolling through this game on pure princess mode.  And it is not worth it.   Sure this might be good to some.  But for an rpgmaker game it's not worth it.   If this game had no custom artwork and let the words do the talking this game could be far better, but for someone like me, this game is whole heartedly unsettling.   I think there are so many other games that are better for your money.

i will start off by pointing out the absurd price for what the author likes to point out as an "RPG MAKER GAME" and for those that dont understand this it means that he is taking credit for a program that takes 4/5ths the work out of his game and does it for him providing a amature level programing set up along with the ability to import your own pictures and scenes.

so basically taking the program that is basically an infinite amount of legos for him to play with he still has managed to cock this up. after only 7 mins of playing this game i noticed how poorly used the assets that were given to him. you have open shower currents you cant go behind, path ways purly defined by lake tiles and pit tiles  with random games that you would believe to be able to go through but cant. and not this is just the first area, after grinding for 5 of my 7 mins to get past all the one hit kill enemys and "boss" which literally is programed to kill itself with a critical player hit once its clothes fall off i was able to commision a birdge to get past his greated plot device, a hole in the ground. 

after getting past the pit you are put in an event which is basically a scrpit made from sudo code that are linked to menus so you dont have to type. and it goes off with what i refuse to call writing. the writing is that equal to "the room" aka YOUR TEARING ME APART LISA.

after you get past the shit writing and even shiter map design which i frankly find to be very lazy. where if you leave a section you go to a world map and then walk to the next place. unlike something like pokemon where you actually go on an quest. please remember this is all the happens in the first 7 mins of a game you beat 2 bosses and already 1/4 the way done because there are 8 main bosses.

so if you can complete 1/4 of the game in 7 mins you have to ask "is this game short ?"  and to reply i would have to tell you no. after i refunded this game because having it sit in my library made me feel like a fool and cheated out of my money for medicro what i heasitate to call a game.

but no from what i can tell after looking into it more as i still had files and maps to look at because it was still installed on my pc i was able to find out that it is just more fluff than anything. 

but the final straw for this is that all this "hard work" that the author say he put in didnt even work at first until i rebooted it and fixed the graphical glitches of meltys body not showing up, the hardness selection screen remaining on during the game and the lag and poor response time. which the author will most likely defend by blaming the engine he claims in comments is comparable to the unreal engine.

so let me just get to the closing point if you you got this game here you wanted it for tits and thats all after looking at the other reviews that would be the case for why ever good review it got. but the game is censored in a way that is the laziest thing i have ever seen in my life. all this so he can force it through steams content filter and sell you a .99 cent game for 20 bucks


tldr 
not worth the money
shit teir rpg maker game
only thing the game is hentai
and that is even tumblr esk quality art 


i highly recommend not buying this game. also i tryed to keep this in a short sweet review previously but the author who can not take critisim arugued with me until i decided to put up a legit  review.

This repository contains Python code to compute statistics of Steam reviews.

## Definitions

### Joke review

A "joke review" is a review which does not try to express the reviewer's opinion. Typically, a joke review is a funny 
reference to the game's themes or characters.

### Game hype

The "hype" of a game is its ratio of joke reviews.

## Goal

Our goal is to filter Steam reviews, in order to find out:

* which game has the highest percentage of joke reviews,
* which game benefits the most, in terms of Wilson score, from joke reviews,
* which game has the highest percentage of English reviews.

## Usage

The functions are structured as follows:
* `download_reviews.py` allows to download reviews via Steam API,
* `describe_reviews.py` allows to compute text properties, and then aggregate meta-data and review features,
* `cluster_reviews.py` attempts to divide reviews into clusters.
* `identify_joke_reviews.py` allows to focus on a single game, and classify its reviews as acceptable vs. joke,
* `estimate_hype.py` allows to rank games according to their hype (percentage of joke reviews), Wilson score bonus (due to hype), or percentage of Steam reviews in English (as given by Steam's meta-data and confirmed by Google Translate),
If you are running Windows, you could call these functions using the `steamReviews.bat` script.

To compute [regional rankings](https://www.resetera.com/posts/3786423/) of hidden gems, please refer to my [hidden-gems](https://github.com/woctezuma/hidden-gems)
repository. Archived results are shown in [`regional_rankings/`](regional_rankings/).

## Limitations

Analysis requires [to download reviews through Steam API](https://github.com/woctezuma/download-steam-reviews), which has a rate limit of about 10 reviews per second. A snapshot is available in [my data repository](https://github.com/woctezuma/steam-reviews-data).

Sentiment analysis is performed on reviews written in English. The language is available with Steam's meta-data, but it 
is not always accurate because it requires the reviewers to correctly specify their language at the time the review is 
published. To try to be as robust as possible against mistagging, the language of each review is confirmed by 
[a tool running locally](https://github.com/Mimino666/langdetect), which used to be provided by Google. 
The limitation of this tool is that there are occasional false negatives (reviews which are written in English, but only
consist of 3-5 words, with typos, so the algorithm might not recognize the English language). If you are looking for a 
better accuracy, at the expense of a slower running time and numerous pings to Google Translate, you could directly use
the language detection function provided by [TextBlob](https://github.com/sloria/TextBlob).

## Input

[A list of 250 hidden gems](hidden_gems.md) has been processed in January 2018. Here is an excerpt of the input:

## Results

Here are the results as [output](output/output_rankings.txt) by `estimate_hype.py`.

### Ranking of games by hype

A hype of 0.300 means that 30.0% of the English reviews are classified as joke reviews.

NB: For `Planetarian HD`, only 1.4% of reviews are written in English, so 30% hype is only due to very few English reviews.

```

### Ranking of games by benefit from hype

A Wilson score bonus (or deviation) of 0.077 means that the game's Wilson score (95% confidence) is improved by 7.7% thanks to the joke reviews.

NB: The Wilson score depends on the sample size, and may vary widly after small adjustements in case of small sample sizes. The impact of filtering joke reviews is expected to be strong for games with few English reviews.

### Ranking of games by proportion of (self-described) English reviews

Some games appear at the top of the ranking of hidden gems, yet at the bottom of the ranking by proportion of English reviews: these games are really pushed to the higher ranks by non-English reviewers.

NB: Three games do not appear in this ranking as the download process failed for them: [Out of the Park Baseball 15](https://steamdb.info/app/272670), [Civilization IV: Beyond the Sword](https://steamdb.info/app/34460), [Little Triangle](https://steamdb.info/app/575050).

### Ranking of games by proportion of (confirmed) English reviews

After assessing the language with a tool to correct for mistagging, the top 10 ranking is roughly the same: `Total Miner`, `Pajama Sam: No Need to Hide When It's Dark Outside` and `Paradigm` are out, while `Unbreakable Vr Runner`, `Subsurface Circular` and `Champions of Breakfast` are in. The bottom 10 consists of the same games which are a priori popular in Asia, and might not have been translated to English.

The games which are reviewed almost exclusively by English speakers seem to be games heavy on English puns (`Metal as Phuk`), or textual adventures (`Herald` to some extent, `Open Sorcery`, `Subsurface Circular`).

[Gorogoa](http://store.steampowered.com/app/557600), [Rusty Lake Paradise](http://store.steampowered.com/app/744190) and [Splasher](http://store.steampowered.com/app/446840) feature respectively 20.6%, 18.2% and 17.2% English reviews. For the first two, this might be due to the fact that these games do not require to be able to read English text as most of the instructions are conveyed through drawings. The game store pages indicate respectively that 17 and 14 languages are supported. For the third game, the texts have been translated to 9 languages, including Chinese, Russian, Japanese, and Brazilian Portuguese.

### Discussion

`Deep Space Waifu` and `Meltys Quest` feature respectively 20.7% and 18.6% joke reviews. However, they do not benefit 
much from joke reviews: their Wilson score is respectively 0.3% and 0.9% lower without the joke reviews.
